        "abstract": "Purpose\nTo determine if anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is superior to anatomic single-bundle reconstruction in restoring the stabilities and functions of the knee joint.\nMethods\nA prospective randomized clinical study was done to compare the results of 32 cases of anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction and 34 cases of anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction with average follow-up of 16.3 \u0412\u00b1 3.1\u0412\u00a0months. Tunnel placements of all the cases were measured on 3D CT. Clinical results were collected after reconstruction; graft's appearance, meniscus status and cartilage state under arthroscopy were compared and analysed too.\nResults\nTunnel placements, confirmed with 3D CT, were in the anatomic positions as described in literature both in SB and DB group. No differences were found between SB and DB groups in clinical outcome scores, pivot shift test and KT 1000\u0412\u00a0measurements (average side-to-side difference for anterior tibial translation was 0.7\u0412\u00a0mm in SB group and 1.0\u0412\u00a0mm in DB group). More than 70 % of the single-bundle graft and AM bundle graft in DB group appeared excellent, but only 44.1 % of PL bundle grafts in DB group were excellent and 11.8 % were in poor state. No new menisci tear was found either in SB or DB group, however, in DB group cartilage damages in medial patella-femoral joint occurred in 38.2 % cases. This rate was significantly higher than in the SB group which is only 9.3 %.\nConclusion\nBoth single- and double-bundle anatomic ACL reconstruction can restore the knee's stability and functions very well. However, more incidences of poor PL status and medial patellar-femoral cartilage damage may occur in double-bundle ACL reconstruction.",

Patient pain levels were measured using the visual analog scale (VAS) at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h post-operatively. Additionally, the number of boluses and total amount of fentanyl dispensed by patient-controlled analgesia administration during the 24-h post-operative period were evaluated.\n\nResults: VAS scores did not differ significantly between groups I and II during the 24-h post-operative period. Mean fentanyl bolus consumption was significantly less in group I compared with group II (p = 0.015).\n\nConclusion: Arthroscopy-guided suprascapular nerve block was not more effective than placebo in reducing post-operative pain in patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of arthroscopy-guided direct suprascapular nerve block performed after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.\n\nMethods: In the present prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical study, 30 patients were divided into two groups: 15 patients (group I) were treated with arthroscopy-guided suprascapular nerve block using 10 mL 0.5 % ropivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine, and 15 patients (group II) were treated with placebo using 10 mL 0.9 % saline after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Patient pain levels were measured using the visual analog scale (VAS) at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h post-operatively. Additionally, the number of boluses and total amount of fentanyl dispensed by patient-controlled analgesia administration during the 24-h post-operative period were evaluated.\n\nResults: VAS scores did not differ significantly between groups I and II during the 24-h post-operative period, but mean fentanyl bolus consumption was significantly less in group I compared with group II (p = 0.015).\n\nConclusion: Arthroscopy-guided suprascapular nerve block at the end of a rotator cuff repair was safe and less time-consuming than expected. Although this procedure did not significantly reduce the post-operative pain, the post-operative need for fentanyl boluses as analgesia was reduced significantly, and it would be beneficial if this procedure involved a sensory branch of axillary nerve block or was performed at the beginning of the arthroscopic procedure.",

New video-guided airway management technology is available, which may minimize the risk to patients from this procedure.\n\nMethods: This was a controlled clinical trial conducted in the trauma receiving unit in a university-affiliated urban hospital in which 623 consecutive adult patients requiring emergency airway management were prospectively randomized to intubation with either the direct laryngoscope (DL) or the GlideScope video laryngoscope (GVL) device.

A total of 151 patients were randomly assigned to the tenotomy group (77 patients) or the tenodesis group (74 patients). Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was performed in all the patients.

No significant differences in the clinical results for the constant scores, the forearm supination and elbow flexion strength indices, Popeye sign, cramping pain and satisfaction level were found between the groups.

At a minimum followup of 4.9 years (mean, 5.9 years; range, 4.9-7.2 years), 68 of the 70 surviving patients were examined by a study nurse and study physiotherapist blinded to initial treatment. Questionnaires on hip function (Harris hip score), quality of life (Eq5D), and activity of daily living function (Barthel ADL) were administered. The Barthel ADL index score was split into good function (score 95 or 100) and reduced function (score below 95).\n\nResults: The mean survival of the groups was similar with 66.4% (73 of 110) of the patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty and 70.5% (79 of 112) of the patients undergoing internal fixation having died since surgery (p = 0.51). Only 12 of 31 living patients in the internal fixation group had retained their native hips at a mean of 6 years. Between 2 and 6 years, there were two new major reoperations (both in the internal fixation group, for avascular necrosis and deep wound infection). The mean Harris hip score was 66 (SD 19) and 67 (SD 20) in the internal fixation and hemiarthroplasty groups, respectively (p = 0.96). The mean Eq5D index was 0.50 (SD 0.40) in the internal fixation group and 0.34 (SD 0.36) in the hemiarthroplasty group (p = 0.10). Function in terms of ADLs was comparable between the groups; of the patients in the internal fixation group, 42% reported good function on the Barthel ADL index, and the corresponding number in the hemiarthroplasty group was 51% (p = 0.44).\n\nConclusions: Hemiarthroplasty has predictable and good long-term results after FNF and is the treatment of choice compared with internal fixation. Further studies will evaluate if total hip arthroplasty has advantages over hemiarthroplasty in patients with fracture with long life expectancy.",

Most MIS TKA surgeons (and many surgeons who use other approaches as well) excise the fat pad for better exposure of the knee. There is still controversy about the result of fat pad excision on patella baja, pain, and function.\n\nQuestions/purposes: In the setting of a randomized controlled trial, we sought to determine whether infrapatellar fat pad excision during MIS TKA causes (1) patellar tendon shortening (as measured by patella baja); (2) increased anterior knee pain; (3) decreases in the Knee Society Score or functional subscore; or (4) more patella-related complications.\n\nMethods: We randomized 90 patients undergoing MIS TKA at one institution into two groups. In one group, 45 patients underwent MIS TKA with complete infrapatellar fat pad excision and in the other group, 45 patients received MIS TKA without infrapatellar fat pad excision. The patella was selectively resurfaced in these patients; there was no difference between the groups in terms of the percentage of patients whose patellae were resurfaced. We measured patellar tendon shortening, knee flexion, anterior knee pain, Knee Society Score (KSS), functional subscore, and patellar complications at preoperative and postoperative periods of 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year; complete followup data were available on 86% of patients (77 of 90) who were enrolled.\n\nResults: At the final followup, no significant differences were observed in patellar tendon shortening, KSS, functional subscore, or knee flexion in either group.

No patellar complications were found in either group.\n\nConclusions: Infrapatellar fat pad excision in MIS TKA resulted in an increasing small percentage of patients with anterior knee pain after surgery.

We seek to \ndetermine whether a scalable, low-cost, unidirectional, text message-based \nmobile health intervention (TExT-MED) improves clinical outcomes, increases \nhealthy behaviors, and decreases ED utilization in a safety net population.\nMETHODS: We conducted an randomized controlled trial of 128 adult patients with \npoorly controlled diabetes (glycosylated hemoglobin [Hb A1C] level \u0432\u2030\u04908%) in an \nurban, public ED. The TExT-MED group received 2 daily text messages for 6 months \nin English or Spanish. The primary outcome was change in Hb A1C level. Secondary \noutcomes included changes in medication adherence, self-efficacy, performance of \nself-care tasks, quality of life, diabetes-specific knowledge, ED utilization, \nand patient satisfaction.\nRESULTS: Hb A1C level decreased by 1.05% in the TExT-MED group compared with \n0.60% in the controls (\u041e\u201d0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.27 to 1.17) at 6 \nmonths. Secondary outcomes favored the TExT-MED group, with the most sizable \nchange observed in self-reported medication adherence (as measured by the \nMorisky Medication Adherence Scale, an 8-point validated scale with higher \nscores representing better adherence), which improved from 4.5 to 5.4 in the \nTExT-MED group compared with a net decrease of -0.1 in the controls (\u041e\u201d1.1 [95% \nCI 0.1 to 2.1]).

Data \nwere collected at baseline and 18-months after randomisation. The primary \noutcome was admission to hospital under the Mental Health Act. The economic \nevaluation took a service perspective (health, social care and criminal justice \nservices) and a societal perspective (additionally including criminal activity \nand productivity losses).\nFINDINGS: The addition of JCPs to TAU had no significant effect on compulsory \nadmissions or total societal cost per participant over 18-months follow-up.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Compulsory admission to psychiatric hospitals may be distressing, \ndisruptive to patients and families, and associated with considerable cost to \nthe health service. Improved patient experience and cost reductions could be \nrealised by providing cost-effective crisis planning services.\nMETHODS: Economic evaluation within a multi-centre randomised controlled trial \ncomparing Joint Crisis Plans (JCP) plus treatment as usual (TAU) to TAU alone \nfor patients aged over 16, with at least one psychiatric hospital admission in \nthe previous two years and on the Enhanced Care Programme Approach register. \nJCPs, containing the patient's treatment preferences for any future psychiatric \nemergency, are a form of crisis intervention that aim to mitigate the negative \nconsequences of relapse, including hospital admission and use of coercion. Data \nwere collected at baseline and 18-months after randomisation. The primary \noutcome was admission to hospital under the Mental Health Act. The economic \nevaluation took a service perspective (health, social care and criminal justice \nservices) and a societal perspective (additionally including criminal activity \nand productivity losses).\nFINDINGS: The addition of JCPs to TAU had no significant effect on compulsory \nadmissions or total societal cost per participant over 18-months follow-up. From \nthe service cost perspective, however, evidence suggests a higher probability \n(80%) of JCPs being the more cost-effective option. Exploration by ethnic group \nhighlights distinct patterns of costs and effects. Whilst the evidence does not \nsupport the cost-effectiveness of JCPs for White or Asian ethnic groups, there \nis at least a 90% probability of the JCP intervention being the more \ncost-effective option in the Black ethnic group.\nINTERPRETATION: The results by ethnic group are sufficiently striking to warrant \nfurther investigation into the potential for patient gain from JCPs among black \npatient groups.",

However, using isokinetic evaluation, a significant difference was found in the isokinetic muscle strength differences and total work difference of the flexor muscle between the two groups when patients were tested at 180\u0412\u00b0/s. Less loss of strength was detected in the isokinetic muscle strength differences of the flexor muscle in Group 2 (-4.2%) than in Group 1 (-23.1%).\nConclusion:\u0412\u00a0For patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty, post-operative flexor muscle strength is improved if the knee is flexed during wound closure.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: To compare the clinical outcome between the use of knotless sutures versus knot-tying sutures in arthroscopic Bankart repairs.\n\nMethods: Between January 2007 and January 2011, 87 patients who underwent arthroscopic Bankart repair with the use of knot-tying suture anchors or knotless suture anchors were evaluated, with 45 patients in the knot-tying suture group and 42 patients in the knotless group. Patients were assigned to either group, with odd-numbered patients going to the knot-tying suture arm and even-numbered patients assigned to the knotless arm. Outcomes included the Constant score, the visual analog scale (VAS) score, patient satisfaction score, and range of motion in forward flexion and external rotation with the arm in adduction. Redislocations or subluxations with the 2 techniques was also studied.\n\nResults: Both groups showed a statistically significant improvement between the preoperative and postoperative VAS scores and Constant scores. In the knot-tying suture group, the VAS score improved from 2.5 \u00b1 2.3 to 0.7 \u00b1 0.5 (P < .05) and the Constant score improved from 64 \u00b1 7 to 92 \u00b1 10 (P < .05). In the knotless group, the VAS score improved from 2.8 \u00b1 2.5 to 0.9 \u00b1 0.6 (P < .05), and the Constant score improved from 62 \u00b1 6 to 89 \u00b1 9 (P < .05). The patient satisfaction scores were 6.9 and 7.1 for the knot tying and knotless groups, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found when comparing the outcomes between the 2 groups. The change in the range of forward flexion and external rotation was also similar in the 2 groups. There was also no difference in recurrence or redislocation rates.\n\nConclusions: Both the knot-tying and knotless suture anchors groups showed statistically significant and similar improvement in VAS and Constant scores. Both anchors provided reasonable outcomes. The knotless suture anchor is a good alternative to knot-tying suture anchors so that arthroscopic Bankart repairs can be performed without knot tying.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: To compare the clinical outcome between the use of knotless sutures versus knot-tying sutures in arthroscopic Bankart repairs.\n\nMethods: Between January 2007 and January 2011, 87 patients who underwent arthroscopic Bankart repair with the use of knot-tying suture anchors or knotless suture anchors were evaluated, with 45 patients in the knot-tying suture group and 42 patients in the knotless group. Patients were assigned to either group, with odd-numbered patients going to the knot-tying suture arm and even-numbered patients assigned to the knotless arm. The primary outcome was the Constant score. Secondary outcomes included the visual analog scale (VAS) score, patient satisfaction score, range of motion in forward flexion and external rotation with the arm in adduction, and redislocations or subluxations.\n\nResults: No statistically significant differences were found when comparing the Constant scores between the 2 groups. The knot-tying suture group had a postoperative Constant score of 92 \u00b1 10 and the knotless group had a postoperative Constant score of 89 \u00b1 9. For secondary outcomes, the postoperative VAS scores were 0.7 \u00b1 0.5 and 0.9 \u00b1 0.6 for the knot-tying and knotless groups, respectively. The patient satisfaction scores were 6.9 and 7.1 for the knot tying and knotless groups, respectively. The change in the range of forward flexion and external rotation was similar in the 2 groups. There was no difference in recurrence or redislocation rates between groups.\n\nConclusions: Knotless suture anchors were not more effective than knot-tying suture anchors on the Constant score in patients undergoing arthroscopic Bankart repairs.",

Eligible patients with \nED nausea and vomiting were randomized to receive 4 mg intravenous ondansetron, \n20 mg intravenous metoclopramide, or saline solution placebo. Primary outcome \nwas mean change in visual analog scale (VAS) rating of nausea severity from \nenrollment to 30 minutes after study drug administration. Secondary outcomes \nincluded patient satisfaction, need for rescue antiemetic treatment, and adverse \nevents.\nRESULTS: Of 270 recruited patients, 258 (95.6%) were available for analysis. Of \nthese patients, 87 (33.7%) received ondansetron; 88 (34.1%), metoclopramide; and \n83 (32.2%), placebo. Baseline characteristics between treatment groups and \nrecruitment site were similar.

Mean cumulative fentanyl consumption during the first 48 hours was lower in Group L than in Group C (P<0.05). The pain scores at rest were lower in Group L at 6 and 12 hours after surgery (P<0.05). No significant intergroup difference was noted in functional recovery. The addition of pregabalin led to an additive reduction in early postoperative pain and analgesic consumption.",

The STAND group trained according to a standardised \nrehabilitation protocol. Subjects in the LOW and HIGH group trained as did the \nSTAND group but with the addition of seated knee extensor open kinetic chain \nresistance training at loads of 2 sets of 20 repetition maximum (RM) and 20 sets \nof 2RM, respectively. Anterior knee laxity and measurements of physical and \nsubjective function were performed at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks. Thirty-six \nsubjects were tested at both baseline and 12 weeks (STAND n = 13, LOW n = 11, \nHIGH n = 12).\nRESULTS: The LOW group demonstrated a reduction in 133 N anterior knee laxity \nbetween baseline and 12 weeks testing when compared to the HIGH and the STAND \ngroups (p = 0.009). Specifically, the trained-untrained knee laxity decreased an \naverage of approximately 5 mm in the LOW group while remaining the same in the \nother two groups.\nCONCLUSION: Twelve weeks of knee extensor open kinetic chain resistance training \nat loads of 2 sets of 20RM led to a reduction in anterior knee laxity in the \nACLI knee. This reduction in laxity does not appear to offer any significant \nshort-term functional advantages when compared to a standard rehabilitation \nprotocol. These results indicate that knee laxity can be decreased with \nresistance training of the thigh muscles.",

Previously, we reported effective \nprevention of venous stasis by transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation \n(TENS). It is hypothesized that TENS might be a thromboprophylactic tool for the \nlimb undergoing surgery. The purpose of this study is to clarify the clinical \nefficacy and safety of TENS in patients during total knee arthroplasty (TKA).\nMETHODS: Ninety patients undergoing primary TKA were involved and randomly \nallocated to the TENS or control group. In the TENS group, electrical \nstimulation of the common fibular nerve, which produced a brisk dorsiflexion of \nthe ankle, was performed for the operated leg during surgery. In the control \ngroup, no electrical stimulation was applied. Serum D-dimer and soluble fibrin \nmonomer complex (SFMC) levels were measured before surgery, immediately after \nsurgery, and post-operative day (POD) 1.

The \nincidence of DVT was 11 % (five cases) in the TENS group while 31 % (14 cases) \nin control (p = 0.02). There were no adverse effects related to TENS.\nCONCLUSIONS: TENS during TKA showed significant effects on preventing DVT. \nSustaining muscle pump activation during surgery prevented not only venous \nstasis, but also hypercoagulability of blood. Intraoperative TENS is a safe and \nnovel strategy against early post-operative thromboembolism, which is difficult \nto be completed through existing prophylaxis after total joint arthroplasty.",

Nebulized\u0412\u00a0fentanyl\u0412\u00a0is also an effective temporary substitute. This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of nebulized fentanyl with intravenous (IV) morphine on management of acute limb pain.\nMethods\nThis was a placebo-controlled, double-blind\u0412\u00a0randomized clinical trial. Ninety emergency department patients with moderate to severe pain aged 15 to 50 years were blocked randomized and enrolled in this study. Forty-seven patients in the experimental group received nebulized fentanyl (4\u0412\u00a0\u041e\u0458g/kg) and IV normal saline as placebo, and the remaining 43 patients in the control group received IV morphine (0.1 mg/kg) and nebulized normal saline as placebo. All participants' pain scores were assessed by Numerical Rating Scale before and after intervention at 5-, 10-, 15-, 30-, 45-, and 60-minute intervals. Patients' vital sign and possible\u0412\u00a0adverse effects\u0412\u00a0were recorded respectively. Finally, all participants were assessed for their satisfaction.\nResults\nThe mean initial pain score in the experimental group was 8.7 and 8.4 in the control group (P\u0412\u00a0= .1). Pain relief in both groups after 5 and 10 minutes were similar (P\u0412\u00a0= .72). Although the pain relief was significantly greater with fentanyl at 15 minutes, this difference is not clinically significant. Pain management in both groups was successful and was more than 3 scores reduction in Numerical Rating Scale. Patient satisfaction in both groups was similar. No adverse effects were reported in the experimental group.\nConclusion\nThis study suggests that nebulized fentanyl is a rapid, safe, and effective method for temporary control of acute limb pain in emergency department patients.",

        "abstract": "Objective\nIntravenous morphine has been used as a common method of pain control in emergency care. Nebulized fentanyl is also an effective temporary substitute. This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of nebulized fentanyl with intravenous (IV) morphine on management of acute limb pain.\nMethods\nThis was a placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized clinical trial. Ninety emergency department patients with moderate to severe pain aged 15 to 50 years were blocked randomized and enrolled in this study. Forty-seven patients in the experimental group received nebulized fentanyl (4 \u03bcg/kg) and IV normal saline as placebo, and the remaining 43 patients in the control group received IV morphine (0.1 mg/kg) and nebulized normal saline as placebo. The primary outcome was pain relief measured by Numerical Rating Scale. All participants' pain scores were assessed by Numerical Rating Scale before and after intervention at 5-, 10-, 15-, 30-, 45-, and 60-minute intervals. Patients' vital signs and possible adverse effects were recorded respectively. Patient satisfaction was also assessed.\nResults\nThe mean initial pain score in the experimental group was 8.7 and 8.4 in the control group (P = .1). Pain relief in both groups after 5 and 10 minutes were similar (P = .72). Pain relief was significantly greater with fentanyl at 15 minutes, but this difference was not clinically significant. Pain reduction was more than 3 scores in Numerical Rating Scale in both groups. Patient satisfaction in both groups was similar. No adverse effects were reported in the experimental group.\nConclusion\nNebulized fentanyl was not more effective than IV morphine in patients with acute limb pain.",

The primary \nendpoint was defined as meeting predetermined discharge eligibility criteria \nwithin 6 hours of study drug administration. Discharge criteria included \nimprovement of edema, stable vital signs, absence of stridor, absence of dyspnea \nor use of accessory muscles during respiration, absence of drooling, and ability \nto drink without difficulty.\nRESULTS: An interim analysis showed that a high percentage of subjects met the \nprimary endpoint, and the study was halted. Overall, 79 subjects were randomized \nand 76 had data for analysis. Most had mild (45%) or moderate (42%) ACEIA. The \ndischarge eligibility endpoint was met by 72% of the placebo group and 85%, 89%, \nand 89% of the ecallantide 10-, 30-, and 60-mg groups, respectively.

Our data \nsuggest that most ED patients presenting with mild to moderate ACEIA are likely \nto meet our discharge eligibility criteria within 6 hours of treatment, \nregardless of intervention. Further studies to assess the utility of ecallantide \nin patients with more severe angioedema may be useful. No new safety signals \nrelated to ecallantide administration were identified.",

In this study, the analgesic effects \nof six different drug combinations were compared.\nMETHODS: A total of 256 patients undergoing TKA for primary osteoarthritis were \nrandomized into one of six groups: a control group (saline solution, \nepinephrine, and cefazolin, n = 42), Group 1 (ropivacaine, n = 43), Group 2 \n(ropivacaine + morphine, n = 43), Group 3 (ropivacaine + ketorolac, n = 42), \nGroup 4 (ropivacaine + morphine + ketorolac, n = 43), and Group 5 (ropivacaine + \nmorphine + ketorolac + methylprednisolone, n = 43). Pain level assessed by \nvisual analogue scale (VAS) and opioid consumption were primary outcomes. The \nincidence of complications, range of motion (ROM), C-reactive protein (CRP) \nvalue, and the amount of post-operative blood drainage were also compared.\nRESULTS: Patients in Groups 4 and 5 complained less pain than the control group \nfor the first 12 h after surgery, and the patients in the other groups showed \nless pain only during the initial 6 h after surgery. Groups 4 and 5 also showed \nless opioid consumption than the control group during the 24 h period after \nsurgery. Patients in Group 5 showed no significant difference in VAS score and \nopioid consumption compared with Group 4, but they had lower CRP value and \ngreater ROM than any other groups at post-operative day 2 and day 4.\nCONCLUSION: Group 4 (ropivacaine + morphine + ketorolac) was not more effective \non pain level and opioid consumption than Group 5 (ropivacaine + morphine + \nketorolac + methylprednisolone) in patients undergoing TKA for primary \nosteoarthritis.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Although the analgesic effect of periarticular injection after total \nknee arthroplasty (TKA) has been well documented, the gold standard for drug \ncombination has not yet been established. In this study, the analgesic effects \nof six different drug combinations were compared.\nMETHODS: A total of 256 patients undergoing TKA for primary osteoarthritis were \nrandomized into one of six groups: a control group (saline solution, \nepinephrine, and cefazolin, n = 42), Group 1 (ropivacaine, n = 43), Group 2 \n(ropivacaine + morphine, n = 43), Group 3 (ropivacaine + ketorolac, n = 42), \nGroup 4 (ropivacaine + morphine + ketorolac, n = 43), and Group 5 (ropivacaine + \nmorphine + ketorolac + methylprednisolone, n = 43). Pain level assessed by \nvisual analogue scale (VAS) and opioid consumption were primary outcomes. The \nincidence of complications, range of motion (ROM), C-reactive protein (CRP) \nvalue, and the amount of post-operative blood drainage were also compared.\nRESULTS: Patients in Groups 4 and 5 complained less pain than the control group \nfor the first 12 h after surgery, and the patients in the other groups showed \nless pain only during the initial 6 h after surgery. Groups 4 and 5 also showed \nless opioid consumption than the control group during the 24 h period after \nsurgery. Patients in Group 5 showed no significant difference in VAS score and \nopioid consumption compared with Group 4, but they had lower CRP value and \ngreater ROM than any other groups at post-operative day 2 and day 4.\nCONCLUSION: The combination of ropivacaine, morphine, and ketorolac showed a \nsignificantly stronger and sufficiently synergistic analgesic effect without \nadding methylprednisolone in periarticular injection after TKA. The clinical \nrelevance of the study is that the combination of ropivacaine, morphine, and \nketorolac can be a good option for periarticular injection following TKA in \nterms of synergistic analgesic effect and efficiency of drug combination.",

A Lab-score \u0432\u2030\u04903 showed the following characteristics: \nsensitivity 85.1% (95% CI: 76.5-93.6%), specificity 87.3% (95% CI: 82.7-91.8%), \npositive predictive value 68.7% (95% CI: 58.7-78.7%), negative predictive value \n94.1% (95% CI: 91.5-97.9%), positive and negative likelihood ratios: 6.68 and \n0.17 respectively. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was \nbest for the Lab-score (0.911, 95% CI: 0.871-0.950).\nDISCUSSION: No difference regarding antibiotic treatment rate was observed when \nusing the Lab-score, due to lack of adherence to the related recommendations. \nHowever, if strictly followed, a significant 26.5% reduction of antibiotic \nprescriptions would have been encountered. Medical education needs to be \nreinforced in order to observe rather than treat low-risk well-appearing \nchildren with FWS.",

        "abstract": "Background:\u0412\u00a0Component alignment can influence implant longevity as well as perhaps pain and function after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), but correct alignment is not consistently achieved. To increase the likelihood that good alignment will be achieved during surgery, smart tools such as robotics or patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) have been introduced.\nQuestions/purposes:\u0412\u00a0We hypothesized that UKA performed with PSI would result in improved level gait as ascertained with three-dimensional analysis, implant positioning, and patient-reported outcomes measured by a validated scoring system when compared with conventional instrumentation 3 months and 1 year after surgery.\nMethods:\u0412\u00a0We randomized 60 patients into two groups using either the PSI technique or a conventional technique. All patients were operated on using the same technique and the same cemented metal-backed implant. Mean age of the patients was 63 \u0412\u00b1 4 years (range, 54-72 years) and mean body mass index was 28 \u0412\u00b1 3 kg/m(2). Patients were evaluated preoperatively, at 3 months, and 1 year after surgery by an independent observer blind to the type of technique. Gait parameters were assessed with three-dimensional analysis during level walking preoperatively and at 1 year, frontal and sagittal position of the implant was evaluated on full-length radiographs at 3 months, and subjective functional outcome and quality of life using routine questionnaires (SF-12, new Knee Society Score [KSS], Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) at 3 months and 1 year. This study had 80% power to detect a 15% difference in walking speed at the p < 0.05 level.\nResults:\u0412\u00a0One year after surgery, there were no differences between the two groups in the analyzed gait spatiotemporal parameters, respectively, for PSI UKA and conventional UKA : double limb support 31% (25%-54%) versus 30% (23%-56%; p = 0.67) and walking speed (1.59 m/s [0.86-1.87 m/s] versus 1.57 m/s [0.71-1.96 m/s]; p = 0.41). No difference was observed between the two groups in terms of lower limb alignment (PSI group 178\u0412\u00b0 \u0412\u00b1 3\u0412\u00b0, conventional group 178\u0412\u00b0 \u0412\u00b1 4\u0412\u00b0; p = 0.24) or implant positioning on mediolateral and anteroposterior radiographs. There were no differences in the functional score between the PSI and conventional TKA groups at 3 months and 1 year after surgery: KSS objective knee scores (PSI: 85 \u0412\u00b1 8 points at 3 months, 87 \u0412\u00b1 5 points at 1 year and conventional instrumentation: 82 \u0412\u00b1 8 points at 3 months 83 \u0412\u00b1 6 points at 1 year; p = 0.10) and functional activity scores were similar in both group (PSI: 71 \u0412\u00b1 12 points at 3 months and 74 \u0412\u00b1 7 points at 1 year versus conventional group: 73 \u0412\u00b1 11 points at 3 months and 75 \u0412\u00b1 6 at 1 year; p = 0.9).\nConclusions:\u0412\u00a0Our observations suggest that PSI may confer small, if any, advantage in alignment, pain, or function after UKA. This argument can therefore not be used to justify the extra cost and uncertainty related to this technique.",

        "abstract": "Background: Component alignment can influence implant longevity as well as perhaps pain and function after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), but correct alignment is not consistently achieved. To increase the likelihood that good alignment will be achieved during surgery, smart tools such as robotics or patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) have been introduced.\nQuestions/purposes: We hypothesized that UKA performed with PSI would result in improved level gait as ascertained with three-dimensional analysis, implant positioning, and patient-reported outcomes measured by a validated scoring system when compared with conventional instrumentation 3 months and 1 year after surgery.\nMethods: We randomized 60 patients into two groups using either the PSI technique or a conventional technique. All patients were operated on using the same technique and the same cemented metal-backed implant. Mean age of the patients was 63 \u00b1 4 years (range, 54-72 years) and mean body mass index was 28 \u00b1 3 kg/m(2). Patients were evaluated preoperatively, at 3 months, and 1 year after surgery by an independent observer blind to the type of technique. Gait parameters were assessed with three-dimensional analysis during level walking preoperatively and at 1 year, frontal and sagittal position of the implant was evaluated on full-length radiographs at 3 months, and subjective functional outcome and quality of life using routine questionnaires (SF-12, new Knee Society Score [KSS], Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) at 3 months and 1 year. This study had 80% power to detect a 15% difference in walking speed at the p < 0.05 level.\nResults: One year after surgery, there were no differences between the two groups in the analyzed gait spatiotemporal parameters, respectively, for PSI UKA and conventional UKA: double limb support 31% (25%-54%) versus 30% (23%-56%; p = 0.67) and walking speed (1.59 m/s [0.86-1.87 m/s] versus 1.57 m/s [0.71-1.96 m/s]; p = 0.41). No difference was observed between the two groups in terms of lower limb alignment (PSI group 178\u00b0 \u00b1 3\u00b0, conventional group 178\u00b0 \u00b1 4\u00b0; p = 0.24) or implant positioning on mediolateral and anteroposterior radiographs. There were no differences in the functional score between the PSI and conventional TKA groups at 3 months and 1 year after surgery: KSS objective knee scores (PSI: 85 \u00b1 8 points at 3 months, 87 \u00b1 5 points at 1 year and conventional instrumentation: 82 \u00b1 8 points at 3 months 83 \u00b1 6 points at 1 year; p = 0.10) and functional activity scores were similar in both group (PSI: 71 \u00b1 12 points at 3 months and 74 \u00b1 7 points at 1 year versus conventional group: 73 \u00b1 11 points at 3 months and 75 \u00b1 6 at 1 year; p = 0.9).\nConclusions: PSI was not more effective than conventional instrumentation in patients with unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.",

The \npurpose of this study was to compare two post-operative rehabilitation protocols \nand to evaluate the clinical outcome of early full weight-bearing after open \nwedge HTO.\nMETHODS: One hundred and twenty consecutive patients with varus malalignment and \nmedial compartment osteoarthritis received an open wedge HTO using an angular \nlocking plate fixation between December 2008 and December 2011. All patients \nwere assigned randomly into one of two groups with different post-operative \nrehabilitation protocols (11-day vs. 6-week 20-kg partial weight-bearing). \nClinical outcome was evaluated using established instruments (Lequesne, Lysholm, \nHSS and IKDC scores) preoperatively, 6, 12 and 18\u0412\u00a0months post-operatively. \nDeformity analysis was performed preoperatively and during follow-up.\nRESULTS: All clinical scores showed a significant pre- to post-operative \nimprovement. After 6\u0412\u00a0months, there was a higher improvement in the group of \nearly full weight-bearing. The difference between preoperative and 6-month \nfollow-up for the group with early full weight-bearing and for the group with \n20-kg PWB for 6\u0412\u00a0weeks was 28\u0412\u00a0\u0412\u00b1\u0412\u00a026 and 18\u0412\u00a0\u0412\u00b1\u0412\u00a022, respectively, for the Lysholm \nscore and -5.0\u0412\u00a0\u0412\u00b1\u0412\u00a05.1 and -3.0\u0412\u00a0\u0412\u00b1\u0412\u00a03.6, respectively, for the Lequesne score.\nCONCLUSIONS: Early full weight-bearing (11-day 20-kg partial weight-bearing) \nafter open wedge HTO without bone graft leads to earlier improvement of the \nclinical results and can be recommended for post-operative rehabilitation after \nopen wedge HTO and fixation with an angular locking plate.",

It also \nevaluates the need for additional doses of analgesics in the first 24 hours of \ndischarge from emergency department (ED).\nMETHODS: Adult (>18 years old) patients with soft tissue injuries were enrolled \nin a teaching urban ED. Subjects were randomly allocated to receive a single \ndose of oral oxycodone (5 mg) or oral naproxen (250 mg). Pain scores and drugs' \nadverse effects were assessed before, 30 minutes, and 60 minutes after \nmedication.\nOUTCOME: efficacy in pain control (reduction in pain scale >2 points) and safety \n(rate of side effects). The need for additional pain medication after discharge \nwas assessed by follow-up phone call 24 hours after discharge.\nRESULTS: A total of 150 patients were enrolled. Pain scores were similar in \noxycodone vs naproxen groups before (6.21 \u0412\u00b1 0.9 in vs 6.0 \u0412\u00b1 1.0), 30 minutes \n(4.5 \u0412\u00b1 1.4 vs 4.4 \u0412\u00b1 1.2), and 60 minutes (2.5 \u0412\u00b1 1.3 in vs 2.6 \u0412\u00b1 1.3) after \nmedication, respectively. Twelve (16.0%) patients in oral oxycodone group and 5 \n(6.6%) patients in naproxen group needed more analgesics in first 24 hours after \nED discharge. Adverse effects were more common in oxycodone group (statistically \nsignificant difference). The most common adverse effects in oxycodone group were \nnausea, (13.3%); vomiting, (8.0%); dizziness, (5.3%); drowsiness, 3 (4.0%); and \npruritis, (2.7%).\nCONCLUSION: Oral oxycodone is as effective as naproxen in soft tissue injury \npain control but has a less favorable safety profile.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This randomized clinical trial compares the efficacy and safety of \noral oxycodone (an oral opioid) with naproxen (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory \ndrug) in acute pain control in patients with soft tissue injury.\nMETHODS: Adult (>18 years old) patients with soft tissue injuries were enrolled \nin a teaching urban ED. Subjects were randomly allocated to receive a single \ndose of oral oxycodone (5 mg) or oral naproxen (250 mg). Pain scores and drugs' \nadverse effects were assessed before, 30 minutes, and 60 minutes after \nmedication.\nOUTCOME: efficacy in pain control (reduction in pain scale >2 points) and safety \n(rate of side effects). The need for additional pain medication after discharge \nwas assessed by follow-up phone call 24 hours after discharge.\nRESULTS: A total of 150 patients were enrolled. Pain scores were similar in \noxycodone vs naproxen groups before (6.21 \u0412\u00b1 0.9 in vs 6.0 \u0412\u00b1 1.0), 30 minutes \n(4.5 \u0412\u00b1 1.4 vs 4.4 \u0412\u00b1 1.2), and 60 minutes (2.5 \u0412\u00b1 1.3 in vs 2.6 \u0412\u00b1 1.3) after \nmedication, respectively. Twelve (16.0%) patients in oral oxycodone group and 5 \n(6.6%) patients in naproxen group needed more analgesics in first 24 hours after \nED discharge. Adverse effects were more common in oxycodone group. The most common adverse effects in oxycodone group were \nnausea, (13.3%); vomiting, (8.0%); dizziness, (5.3%); drowsiness, 3 (4.0%); and \npruritis, (2.7%).\nCONCLUSION: Oral oxycodone was not more effective than naproxen in patients with soft tissue injury.",

The rate of pulmonary edema/CHF in the first 48h was \n7.9% (59/830) and was more common among ALB treated subjects (RR = 10.7, CI95 \n4.3-26.6); this complication was expected and was satisfactorily managed with \nmandated diuretic administration and intravenous fluid guidelines. Troponin \nelevations in the first 48h were common, occurring without ECG change or cardiac \nsymptoms in 52 subjects (12.5%).\nCONCLUSIONS: ALB therapy was associated with an increase in symptomatic ICH and \npulmonary edema/congestive heart failure but this did not affect final outcomes. \nTroponin elevation occurs routinely in the first 48 hours after acute ischemic \nstroke.",

The study \nobjective was to confirm these findings in a prospective randomized study.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\nMETHODS: Fifty patients undergoing hip arthroscopy were included in this \nprospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial that was patient-, \noperator-, and assessor-blinded.

Rapid targeted \nbrain hypothermia induction, together with prompt correction of the underlying \ncause may improve outcomes in these patients. This study investigates the \nefficacy of Rhinochill, an intranasal cooling device over Blanketrol, a surface \ncooling device in inducing TH in cardiac arrest patients within the cardiac \ncatheter laboratory.\nMETHODS: 70 patients were randomized to TH induction with either Rhinochill or \nBlanketrol. Primary outcome measures were time to reach tympanic \u0432\u2030\u00a434 \u0412\u00b0C from \nrandomisation as a surrogate for brain temperature and oesophageal \u0432\u2030\u00a434 \u0412\u00b0C from \nrandomisation as a measurement of core body temperature. Secondary outcomes \nincluded first hour temperature drop, length of stay in intensive care unit, \nhospital stay, neurological recovery and all-cause mortality at hospital \ndischarge.\nRESULTS: There was no difference in time to reach \u0432\u2030\u00a434 \u0412\u00b0C between Rhinochill and \nBlanketrol (Tympanic \u0432\u2030\u00a434 \u0412\u00b0C, 75 vs. 107 mins; p=0.101; Oesophageal \u0432\u2030\u00a434 \u0412\u00b0C, 85 \nvs. 115 mins; p=0.151). Tympanic temperature dropped significantly with \nRhinochill in the first hour (1.75 vs. 0.94 \u0412\u00b0C; p<0.001). No difference was \ndetected in any other secondary outcome measures. Catheter laboratory-based TH \ninduction resulted in a survival to hospital discharge of 67.1%.\nCONCLUSION: In this study, Rhinochill was not found to be more efficient than \nBlanketrol for TH induction, although there was a non-significant trend in \nfavour of Rhinochill that potentially warrants further investigation with a \nlarger trial.",

        "abstract": "Background: Olecranon bursitis might be a minor problem in the outpatient clinic but relatively be common to occur. However, there are few well-designed studies comparing approaches to treatment.\n\nQuestions/purposes: (1) Which treatment (compression bandaging with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], aspiration, or aspiration with steroid injections) is associated with the highest likelihood of resolution of nonseptic olecranon bursitis? (2) Which treatment is associated with earliest resolution of symptoms? (3) What factors are associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks?\n\nMethods: We enrolled 133 patients from two centers; after applying prespecified exclusions (septic bursitis or concomitant inflammatory arthritis, intraarticular elbow pathology, recent aspiration or steroid injection done elsewhere, and refusal to participate), 90 patients were randomly allocated to receive compression bandaging with NSAIDs (C), aspiration (A), or aspiration with steroid injection (AS) groups (30 patients in each). The groups were similar at baseline in terms of age and gender. Seven patients (four from Group A and three from Group AS) were lost to followup. All patients were followed up weekly for 4 weeks, and the same treatment procedure was repeated if the bursitis recurred with any substantial fluid collection. At 4 weeks, the state of resolution and pain visual analog scale (VAS) were evaluated. Failed resolution was defined as presence of persistent olecranon bursal fluid collection at Week 4 after the initiation of the treatment; on the contrary, if bursal fluid collection was clinically reduced or completely disappeared by the end of Week 4, the treatment was considered successful. We compared the proportion of resolution by Week 4 and the median times to resolution among the treatment groups. In addition, we evaluated whether the resolution affected pain VAS and what factors were associated with the resolution.\n\nResults: There were no differences in the proportion of patients whose bursitis resolved by Week 4 among the three treatment groups (Group C: 25 of 30 [83%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.27-1.72], p = 0.580; Group A: 17 of 26 [65%], relative risk of resolution failure: 2.19 [95% CI, 0.98-4.87], p = 0.083; Group AS: 23 of 27 [85%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.59 [95% CI, 0.22-1.63], p = 0.398) (p = 0.073). Steroid injection after aspiration (Group AS) was associated with the earliest resolution (2.3 weeks [range, 1-4 weeks]) when compared with aspiration alone (Group A; 3.1 weeks [range, 2-4 weeks]) and compression bandaging with NSAIDs (Group C; 3.2 weeks [range, 2-4 weeks]), p = 0.015). Longer duration of symptoms before treatment was the only factor associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks (failed resolution: 6 weeks [range, 2-9 weeks]; successful resolution: 4 weeks [range, 0.4-6 weeks]; p = 0.008).\n\nConclusions: With the numbers available, there were no differences in efficacy when compression bandaging with NSAIDs, aspiration, and aspiration with steroid injection were compared. However, we were powered only to detect a 30% difference, meaning that if there were a smaller difference in efficacy among the groups, we might not have detected it in a study of this size. Our data can be used as pilot data to power future prospective (and likely multicenter) trials. Because olecranon bursitis can recur, and because treatments like aspiration and aspiration with steroid injection can cause complications, unless future trials demonstrate clear efficacy advantages of aspiration and/or injection both at short and longer terms, we suggest that compression bandaging and a short course of NSAIDs may offer the most appropriate balance of safety and efficacy.",

Our hypothesis was that there would be no differences in joint line angles or correction accuracy between the two groups, that patellar height would increase after CW HTO and decrease after OW HTO, and that leg length and posterior tibial slope would decrease after CW HTO and increase after OW HTO.\n\nMethods: Radiological data were collected from 70 patients participating in an ongoing prospective randomized clinical trial comparing OW and CW HTOs. Digital standing hip-knee-ankle (HKA) radiographs as well as lateral radiographs in 30\u040e of flexion were obtained preoperatively and at 6 months for each patient. Joint line angles, HKA angle, leg length, Insall-Salvati index, Miura-Kawamura index and posterior tibial slope were measured using medical planning software. The complete preoperative radiological examinations of the first 50 patients were used in a study of intra- and inter-rater reliability of the measurements.\n\nResults: The mean posterior slope was reduced by 2.5\u040e in CW HTO, whereas it remained unchanged in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Mean leg length decreased 5.7 mm in CW HTO and increased 3.1 mm in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Changes in joint line angles, patellar height indexes and the correction accuracy showed no significant differences comparing the two techniques. Frontal plane reliability measurement intra- and inter-rater intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) varied from 0.81 to 0.99. Sagittal plane intra- and inter-rater ICC varied from 0.60 to 0.87. Posterior tibial slope intra- and inter-rater ICC showed the lowest values (0.70 and 0.60, respectively) corresponding to a smallest real difference of 4.5\u040e and 5.5\u040e, respectively.\n\nConclusions: Posterior tibial slope and leg length changes were significantly different in CW compared to OW HTOs. We recommend that possible alterations in tibial slope and leg length are considered when the technique of HTO is to be chosen. Landmark-based medical planning software shows good reliability and can be used in preoperative planning and postoperative evaluations of HTOs.",

Secondary outcomes included the RAND 12-Item Health Survey. \nSubjects were assessed preoperatively, and at 1, 5, and 10 years postoperatively. \nPlain radiographs were evaluated at 10 years for fixation, and medical records \nwere reviewed for revisions.\nRESULTS: Of 92 subjects, 6 (7%) died within 10 years; 68 (79%) survivors \nprovided radiographic and/or clinical follow-up at 10 years postoperatively. \nThere were no group differences in the Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis \nIndex at 10 years (P > .48). There were no group differences in the RAND 12-Item \nHealth Survey at 10 years (P > .48). There were no failures or loss of fixation \nrelated to bearing surfaces/wear in either group. Over 10 years, 3 subjects in \nthe POLYETHYLENE group had revisions that were related to recurrent dislocation; \n2 revisions were performed within 2 years of surgery, and one further subject \nunderwent revision at 7 years postoperatively.\nCONCLUSIONS: CERAMIC bearing THA was not more effective than POLYETHYLENE \nbearing THA in patients aged <61 years undergoing total hip arthroplasty.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recently, an accelerated rehabilitation protocol after rotator cuff \n(RC) repair has been proposed for patients at risk of postoperative stiffness.\nPURPOSE: To investigate, in patients undergoing early accelerated mobilization, \nwhether double-row (DR) repair provides better clinical outcomes and a lower \nretear rate compared with single-row (SR) configurations.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\nMETHODS: A total of 58 patients were randomized to undergo either SR or DR \nrepair. After 2 years of follow-up, 12 men and 13 women (mean age, 61.8 years; \nrange, 52-67 years) in the SR group and 15 men and 10 women (mean age, 58.9 \nyears; range, 51-69 years) in the DR group were evaluated. To assess the retear \nrate, magnetic resonance imaging of the shoulder was performed at 2-year \nfollow-up. The clinical evaluation was based on the modified University of \nCalifornia, Los Angeles (UCLA) shoulder score and range of motion (ROM) \nmeasurements.\nRESULTS: Magnetic resonance arthrography showed a significantly lower \nfull-thickness retear rate for the DR group than for the SR group (8% vs 24%, \nrespectively; P < .05). Conversely, at both 6-month and 2-year follow-up, there \nwas no statistically significant difference in terms of the rate of stiffness in \nthe SR and DR groups (8% vs 12% and 0% vs 0%, respectively; P > .05). No \nclinical differences were recorded regarding the UCLA score (SR group: mean, \n32.6 [range, 30-35]; DR group: mean, 33.3 [range, 29-35]; P = .61) and ROM.\nCONCLUSION: In selected patients at a high risk of shoulder stiffness and \ntherefore necessitating accelerated postoperative rehabilitation, DR repair of \nthe RC could lower retear rates.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether there are middle-term differences in knee function and pain in patients undergoing fixed- and mobile-bearing total knee arthroplasty (TKA).\n\nMethods: Eligible patients were randomized into two groups: the first group received TKA implantation with a fixed tibial platform (group A); the second group received TKA with a mobile tibial platform (group B). Patients were followed up (2 years), and their symptoms and limitations in daily living activities were evaluated using the Knee Outcome Survey-Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADLS), in addition to pain evaluation assessed using the pain visual analogue scale (VAS).\n\nResults: There were no significant differences in function and symptoms in the ADLS and VAS between the study groups.\n\nConclusion: The type of platform used in TKA (fixed vs. mobile) does not change the symptoms, function or pain of patients 2 years post-surgery. Although mobile TKAs may have better short-term results, at medium- and long-term follow-up they do not present important clinical differences compared with fixed-platform TKAs. This information is important so that surgeons can choose the most suitable implant for each patient.",

Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 1.5, \n3, 6, and 12 months after ACI and was evaluated by the magnetic resonance \nobservation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score and the Knee injury and \nOsteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS).\nRESULTS: MOCART scores showed improvements after 3 months, with slight dose \ndependence, and further improvement after 12 months, although without \nsignificant dose dependence. The mean MOCART scores after 3 months (0 = worst, \n100 = best) were 59.8, 64.5, and 64.7 for the low-, medium-, and high-dose \ngroups, respectively, and 62.9 for all patients; at 12 months, these were 74.1, \n74.5, and 68.8 for the respective dose groups and 72.4 for all patients.

There is still a need for a method of anesthesia that can deliver effective long-term postoperative pain relief without incurring the high cost and health burden of opioids and nerve blocks.\n\nQuestions/purposes: (1) Is liposomal bupivacaine-based periarticular injection (PAI) more effective than morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA? (2) Do patients treated with liposomal bupivacaine-based PAI experience fewer opioid-related adverse events compared with patients treated with morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA?\n\nMethods: This multicenter, blind trial randomized 119 patients undergoing TKA with spinal anesthesia to receive spinal anesthesia plus periarticular injection with liposomal bupivacaine (40 patients), spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine plus intrathecal morphine (41 patients) but no liposomal bupivacaine injection, or spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine (38 patients) and no liposomal bupivacaine injection. The two groups that did not receive periarticular liposomal bupivacaine did receive periarticular injection with ropivacaine, and all three groups had ketorolac (30 mg) plus epinephrine (1:1000) in the periarticular injections. Patients in all three groups received identical perioperative multimodal analgesic and antiemetic drugs. All patients were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized and no patients were lost to followup. The primary study endpoints were visual analog score (VAS) for pain and narcotic use during postoperative day 1. Secondary endpoints included side effects associated with narcotic administration during the hospital stay.\n\nResults: Mean VAS pain in the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group was lower than that for the ropivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (1.8 \u00b1 2.1 versus 3.3 \u00b1 2.3, p = 0.005, mean difference: 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-2.5) and 12 hours (1.5 \u00b1 2.0 versus 3.3 \u00b1 2.4, p < 0.001, mean difference: 1.8, 95% CI, 0.8-2.8) after surgery. The morphine spinal group had lower pain compared with the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (0.9 \u00b1 1.8 versus 1.8 \u00b1 2.1, p = 0.035, mean difference: 1.0, 95% CI, 0.1-1.8), but there was no difference at 12 hours (0.8 \u00b1 1.5 versus 1.5 \u00b1 2.0, p = 0.086, mean difference: 0.7, 95% CI, -0.1 to 1.5). The magnitude of the differences at 6 and 12 hours are near the lower end of minimal clinically important differences reported in the literature, and thus the improvement shown in this study may only represent a small clinical improvement. Both the liposomal bupivacaine group (13% [five of 40]) and the ropivacaine group (5% [two of 38]) had fewer incidents of itching (pruritus) than the spinal morphine group (38% [15 of 41]) (p = 0.001).\n\nConclusions: Liposomal bupivacaine-based periarticular injection was not more effective than morphine-based spinal anesthesia on visual analog score for pain and narcotic use during postoperative day 1 in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.",

Secondary endpoints included side effects associated with narcotic administration during the hospital stay.\n\nResults: Mean VAS pain in the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group was lower than that for the ropivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (1.8 \u00b1 2.1 versus 3.3 \u00b1 2.3, p = 0.005, mean difference: 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-2.5) and 12 hours (1.5 \u00b1 2.0 versus 3.3 \u00b1 2.4, p < 0.001, mean difference: 1.8, 95% CI, 0.8-2.8) after surgery. The morphine spinal group had lower pain compared with the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (0.9 \u00b1 1.8 versus 1.8 \u00b1 2.1, p = 0.035, mean difference: 1.0, 95% CI, 0.1-1.8), but there was no difference at 12 hours (0.8 \u00b1 1.5 versus 1.5 \u00b1 2.0, p = 0.086, mean difference: 0.7, 95% CI, -0.1 to 1.5). The magnitude of the differences at 6 and 12 hours are near the lower end of minimal clinically important differences reported in the literature, and thus the improvement shown in this study may only represent a small clinical improvement. Both the liposomal bupivacaine group (13% [five of 40]) and the ropivacaine group (5% [two of 38]) had fewer incidents of itching (pruritus) than the spinal morphine group (38% [15 of 41]) (p = 0.001).\n\nConclusions: This prospective multicenter three-arm blind randomized controlled trial showed potentially improved pain control at 6 and 12 hours in the liposomal bupivacaine and intrathecal morphine groups compared with the ropivacaine group at the cost of much higher incidences of pruritus (itching) in the intrathecal morphine group. Based on these results, we prefer the use of PAI with liposomal bupivacaine as an alternative to spinal anesthesia with intrathecal morphine as a result of similar postoperative pain control and the potential for reducing adverse events.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Iliopsoas tendon impingement is one possible reason for persistent \ngroin pain and diminished functional outcome after THA. So far, estimation by \neye and palpation is the standard procedure to intraoperatively assess the \ndistance of the cup to the anterior rim. However, novel technologies such as \nimageless navigation enable intraoperative measurements of the cup in relation \nto the psoas tendon and bony landmarks.\nQUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether psoas impingement can be reduced using \nimageless navigation compared with the standard technique.\nMETHODS: The current study is a reanalysis of data from a randomized controlled \ntrial evaluating navigation for THA; 135 patients were randomized for surgery \nwith or without the use of imageless navigation. The primary outcome was the \nrisk for anterior protrusion of the cup above the acetabular rim and thus \npotential psoas impingement, defined as an overhang of the cup above the \nanterior acetabular rim as measured on postoperative CT, which was either \ncontrolled with the help of navigation or standard control by eye and palpation \nintraoperatively. Postoperatively, the anterior protrusion of the cup above the \nacetabular rim was measured on three-dimensional (3-D) CT by a blinded, external \ninstitute. In addition to patient-related outcome measures, the Harris hip \nscore, Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and EuroQol were \nobtained 1 year postoperatively. Altogether 123 data sets were available for \nprimary analysis and 115 were available for 1-year followup.\nRESULTS: There was no difference, with the numbers available, between the \nnavigated and the control groups in terms of the mean distance of the cup below \nthe anterosuperior acetabular rim (3.9 mm; -5.3 to 12.6 mm versus 4.4 mm; -7.9 \nto 13.7 mm; p = 0.72) or the anteroinferior acetabular rim (4.7 mm; -6.2 to 14.8 \nmm versus 4.2 mm; -7.1 to 16.3 mm; p = 0.29). There was no difference, with the \nnumbers available, in terms of the proportion of cups with anterior overhang \n(7%, four of 57 versus, 15%, 10 of 66; p = 0.16), respectively. After \ncontrolling for potential confounding variables such as cup inclination, cup \nsize, patient age, BMI, stage of arthritis, and length of skin incision, we \nfound cup anteversion (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% CI, 0.81-0.93; p < 0.001) \nand female sex (HR, 3.88; 95% CI, 1.01-14.93; p = 0.049) were associated with a \npropensity to potential psoas impingement. With the numbers available, there \nwere no differences observed in clinical scores between groups with and without \nanterior cup protrusion.\nCONCLUSIONS: Imageless navigation was not more effective than estimation by eye \nand palpation in preventing potential psoas impingement in patients undergoing \nTHA.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Iliopsoas tendon impingement is one possible reason for persistent \ngroin pain and diminished functional outcome after THA. So far, estimation by \neye and palpation is the standard procedure to intraoperatively assess the \ndistance of the cup to the anterior rim. However, novel technologies such as \nimageless navigation enable intraoperative measurements of the cup in relation \nto the psoas tendon and bony landmarks.\nQUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether psoas impingement (1) can be reduced using \nimageless navigation compared with the standard technique and (2) is associated \nwith specific patient characteristics. Furthermore, we investigated (3) if \nanterior cup protrusion (overhang) is associated with lower outcome scores for \npain and function.\nMETHODS: The current study is a reanalysis of data from a randomized controlled \ntrial evaluating navigation for THA; 135 patients were randomized for surgery \nwith or without the use of imageless navigation. The risk for anterior \nprotrusion of the cup above the acetabular rim and thus potential psoas \nimpingement, defined as an overhang of the cup above the anterior acetabular rim \nas measured on postoperative CT, was either controlled with the help of \nnavigation or standard control by eye and palpation intraoperatively. \nPostoperatively, the anterior protrusion of the cup above the acetabular rim was \nmeasured on three-dimensional (3-D) CT by a blinded, external institute. In \naddition to patient-related outcome measures, the Harris hip score, Hip \ndisability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and EuroQol were obtained 1 year \npostoperatively. Altogether 123 data sets were available for primary analysis \nand 115 were available for 1-year followup.\nRESULTS: There was no difference, with the numbers available, between the \nnavigated and the control groups in terms of the mean distance of the cup below \nthe anterosuperior acetabular rim (3.9 mm; -5.3 to 12.6 mm versus 4.4 mm; -7.9 \nto 13.7 mm; p = 0.72) or the anteroinferior acetabular rim (4.7 mm; -6.2 to 14.8 \nmm versus 4.2 mm; -7.1 to 16.3 mm; p = 0.29). There was no difference, with the \nnumbers available, in terms of the proportion of cups with anterior overhang \n(7%, four of 57 versus, 15%, 10 of 66; p = 0.16), respectively. After \ncontrolling for potential confounding variables such as cup inclination, cup \nsize, patient age, BMI, stage of arthritis, and length of skin incision, we \nfound cup anteversion (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% CI, 0.81-0.93; p < 0.001) \nand female sex (HR, 3.88; 95% CI, 1.01-14.93; p = 0.049) were associated with a \npropensity to potential psoas impingement. With the numbers available, there \nwere no differences observed in clinical scores between groups with and without \nanterior cup protrusion.\nCONCLUSIONS: We found no differences between imageless navigation and estimation \nby eye and palpation in preventing potential psoas impingement. Despite the \ncomparable clinical outcome for patients with and without cup protrusion, the \northopaedic surgeon should be especially aware of propensity for psoas \nimpingement in women.",

One group received preemptive intra-articular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection, and the second group received preemptive periacetabular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection. Before closure all patients received an additional dose of 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% intra-articularly. Data were compared with respect to postoperative pain with visual analog scale (VAS) and analgesic consumption, documented in a pain diary for 2 weeks after surgery.\n\nResults: Twenty-one patients were treated with intra-articular injection, and 21 patients with peri-acetabular injection. There were no significant differences with regards to patient demographics or surgical procedures. VAS scores recorded during the first 30 minutes postoperatively were 0.667 \u00b1 1.49 in the periacetabular group versus 2.11 \u00b1 2.29 in the intra-articular group (P < .045). VAS scores at 18 hours after surgery were 2.62 \u00b1 2.2 in the periacetabular group versus 4.79 \u00b1 2.6 in the intra-articular group (P < .009). There were no differences between the groups with regard to analgesic consumption.\n\nConclusions: The periacetabular injection was not more effective than intra-articular injection for postoperative pain control in patients undergoing hip arthroscopy.",

Exclusions were patients with multiple injuries, other conditions limiting mobility, and ankle injuries that required immobilisation and those unable to accommodate the time intensive study protocol.\n\nIntervention: Participants received either usual care, consisting of written instructions regarding protection, rest, cryotherapy, compression, elevation, and graduated weight bearing activities, or usual care enhanced with a supervised programme of physiotherapy.\n\nMain outcome measures: The primary outcome of efficacy was the proportion of participants reporting excellent recovery assessed with the foot and ankle outcome score (FAOS).

Included patients met the migraine criteria of the International Headache Society. Patients were randomized to intranasal lidocaine or saline solution; all participants received 10 mg of intravenous metoclopramide. Patient pain intensity was assessed with an 11-point numeric rating scale score. The primary outcome measure was the change in pain scores at 15 minutes; secondary outcomes were changes in pain intensity after pain onset and need for rescue medication.\n\nResults: Patients (n=162) were randomized into 2 groups with similar baseline migraine characteristics and numeric rating scale scores. The median reduction in numeric rating scale score at 15 minutes was 3 (interquartile range [IQR] 2 to 5) for the lidocaine group and 2 (IQR 1 to 4) for the saline solution group (median difference=1.0; 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 2.1). The reduction in pain score at 30 minutes was 4 (IQR 3 to 7) for the lidocaine group and 5 (IQR 2 to 7) for the saline solution group (median difference=1.0; 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 2.1). Need for rescue medication did not differ between the groups, and local irritation was the most common adverse event in the lidocaine group.\n\nConclusion: Although intranasal lidocaine was found no more efficacious than normal saline solution in our study, future studies should focus on patients who present earlier after headache onset.",

        "abstract": "Study objective: The study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intranasal lidocaine administration for migraine treatment.\n\nMethods: This single-center, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial was conducted in a tertiary care emergency department. Included patients met the migraine criteria of the International Headache Society. Patients were randomized to intranasal lidocaine or saline solution; all participants received 10 mg of intravenous metoclopramide. Patient pain intensity was assessed with an 11-point numeric rating scale score. The primary outcome measure was the change in pain scores at 15 minutes; secondary outcomes were changes in pain intensity at 30 minutes and need for rescue medication.\n\nResults: Patients (n=162) were randomized into 2 groups with similar baseline migraine characteristics and numeric rating scale scores. The median reduction in numeric rating scale score at 15 minutes was 3 (interquartile range [IQR] 2 to 5) for the lidocaine group and 2 (IQR 1 to 4) for the saline solution group (median difference=1.0; 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 2.1). The reduction in pain score at 30 minutes was 4 (IQR 3 to 7) for the lidocaine group and 5 (IQR 2 to 7) for the saline solution group (median difference=1.0; 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 2.1). Need for rescue medication did not differ between the groups, and local irritation was the most common adverse event in the lidocaine group.\n\nConclusion: Intranasal lidocaine was not more effective than saline solution in patients with migraine.",

The participants were assessed for anthropometric measures and activity and fulfilled the modified version of the questionnaire \"Family Eating and Activity Habits Questionnaire\" (FEAHQ).\n\nResults: Both \"Activity\" only and \"Diet & Activity\" groups reduced their mean body mass index (BMI) (-1.1, 95% CI -1.3, -0.8, and -1.4, 95% CI -1.7, -1.2, respectively) compared to control at 3 months, with greater reductions at 6 months (-2.3, 95% CI -2.6, -2.0, and -3.1, 95% CI -3.3, -2.8). Changes in waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulses per minute, and 50 m sprint run test were observed at 3 months. Changes in the total FEAHQ score were achieved in the \"Diet & Activity\" group both at 3 months and at 6 months.\n\nConclusions: The combined physical activity and nutritional education program was more effective than control in reducing BMI in overweight and obese adolescents.",

In patients with tenodesis failure, the LHB score ( P = \n.049) and the degree of Popeye deformity by the patient and examiner ( P = .004 \nand .018, respectively) were statistically different compared with patients with \nintact tenodeses.\nCONCLUSION: Care must be taken while performing biceps tenodesis in patients \nwith a higher work level; IS fixation appears to pose a higher risk in terms of \nthe anatomic failure of tenodesis than SA fixation, although functional outcomes \nwere not different.",

High-flow \nwarm humidified oxygen (HFWHO) is increasingly used, but has not been rigorously \nstudied in randomised trials.

Patients were randomly \nallocated (1:1) via opaque sealed envelopes to HFWHO (maximum flow of 1 L/kg per \nmin to a limit of 20 L/min using 1:1 air-oxygen ratio, resulting in a maximum \nFiO2 of 0\u0412\u00b76) or standard therapy (cold wall oxygen 100% via infant nasal \ncannulae at low flow to a maximum of 2 L/min) using a block size of four and \nstratifying for gestational age at birth. The primary outcome was time from \nrandomisation to last use of oxygen therapy. All randomised children were \nincluded in the primary and secondary safety analyses. This trial is registered \nwith the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number \nACTRN12612000685819.\nFINDINGS: From July 16, 2012, to May 1, 2015, we randomly assigned 202 children \nto either HFWHO (101 children) or standard therapy (101 children). Median time \nto weaning was 24 h (95% CI 18-28) for standard therapy and 20 h (95% CI 17-34) \nfor HFWHO (hazard ratio [HR] for difference in survival distributions 0\u0412\u00b79 [95% \nCI 0\u0412\u00b77-1\u0412\u00b72]; log rank p=0\u0412\u00b761). Fewer children experienced treatment failure on \nHFWHO (14 [14%]) compared with standard therapy (33 [33%]; p=0\u0412\u00b70016); of these \nchildren, those on HFWHO were supported for longer than were those on standard \ntherapy before treatment failure (HR 0\u0412\u00b73; 95% CI 0\u0412\u00b72-0\u0412\u00b76; p<0\u0412\u00b70001). 20 (61%) of \n33 children who experienced treatment failure on standard therapy were rescued \nwith HFWHO. 12 (12%) of children on standard therapy required transfer to the \nintensive care unit compared with 14 (14%) of those on HFWHO (difference -1%; \n95% CI -7 to 16; p=0\u0412\u00b741). Four adverse events occurred (oxygen desaturation and \ncondensation inhalation in the HFWHO group, and two incidences of oxygen tubing \ndisconnection in the standard therapy group); none resulted in withdrawal from \nthe trial. No oxygen-related serious adverse events occurred. Secondary \neffectiveness outcomes are reported in the Results section.\nINTERPRETATION: HFWHO did not significantly reduce time on oxygen compared with \nstandard therapy, suggesting that early use of HFWHO does not modify the \nunderlying disease process in moderately severe bronchiolitis. HFWHO might have \na role as a rescue therapy to reduce the proportion of children requiring \nhigh-cost intensive care.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Wide variation exists in inter-hospital survival from \nout-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Regionalisation of care into cardiac \narrest centres (CAC) may improve this. We report a pilot randomised trial of \nexpedited transfer to a CAC following OHCA without ST-elevation. The objective \nwas to assess the feasibility of performing a large-scale randomised controlled \ntrial.\nMETHODS: Adult witnessed ventricular fibrillation OHCA of presumed cardiac cause \nwere randomised 1:1 to either: (1) treatment: comprising expedited transfer to a \nCAC for goal-directed therapy including access to immediate reperfusion, or (2) \ncontrol: comprising current standard of care involving delivery to the \ngeographically closest hospital. The feasibility of randomisation, protocol \nadherence and data collection of the primary (30-day all-cause mortality) and \nsecondary (cerebral performance category (CPC)) and in-hospital major \ncardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) clinical outcome measures were \nassessed.\nRESULTS: Between November 2014 and April 2016, 118 cases were screened, of which \n63 patients (53%) met eligibility criteria and 40 of the 63 patients (63%) were \nrandomised. There were no protocol deviations in the treatment arm. Data \ncollection of primary and secondary outcomes was achieved in 83%. There was no \ndifference in baseline characteristics between the groups: 30-day mortality \n(Intervention 9/18, 50% vs. Control 6/15, 40%; P=0.73), CPC 1/2 (Intervention: \n9/18, 50% vs. Control 7/14, 50%; P>0.99) or MACCE (Intervention: 9/18, 50% vs. \nControl 6/15, 40%; P=0.73).\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings support the feasibility and acceptability of \nconducting a large-scale randomised controlled trial of expedited transfer to \nCAC following OHCA to address a remaining uncertainty in post-arrest care.",

The objective of the present study was to compare both the frequency \nof condylar liftoff and the location of femorotibial contact from extension \nthrough midflexion between patients undergoing GB or MR TKA.\nMETHODS: A total of 24 knees (23 patients) were randomly assigned at referral to \neither a surgeon performing MR or GB TKA with the same single radius, \nposterior-stabilized implant (12 per cohort). At 1-year postoperation, patients \nunderwent biplanar radiographic imaging at 0\u0412\u00b0, 20\u0412\u00b0, 40\u0412\u00b0, and 60\u0412\u00b0 of flexion. \nCondylar liftoff, contact location, and magnitude of excursion on each condyle \nwere measured.

Two groups were \ncreated: V-group (Vicryl\u0412\u00ae 2/0-Ethicon) and S-group (Stratafix\u0432\u201e\u045e 2/0-Ethicon). \nTime spent on closing the enterotomies was measured from first needle in until \nknot and cut (V-group) or last stitch and cut (S-group). If needed, a \nnonabsorbable \"correction\" (\"c\"; in order to close a small hiatus at the \nanastomosis) or hemostatic (\"h\") stitch was made (using a single Prolene\u0412\u00ae \n2/0-Ethicon).\nRESULTS: Average total procedure time was similar (S-group 1:01:22, V-group \n1:00:44, P\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a00.340).

        "abstract": "Background: The use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) has demonstrated mixed clinical outcomes in randomized controlled trials when compared with hyaluronic acid (HA), an accepted nonsurgical treatment for symptomatic OA. Biological analysis of PRP has demonstrated an anti-inflammatory effect on the intra-articular environment.\n\nPurpose: To compare the clinical and biological effects of an intra-articular injection of PRP with those of an intra-articular injection of HA in patients with mild to moderate knee OA.\n\nStudy design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\n\nMethods: A total of 111 patients with symptomatic unilateral knee OA received a series of either leukocyte-poor PRP or HA injections under ultrasound guidance. Clinical data were collected before treatment and at 4 time points across a 1-year period. Synovial fluid was also collected for analysis of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers before treatment and at 12 and 24 weeks after treatment. Several measures were used to assess results: (1) Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale; (2) International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee evaluation, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, and Lysholm knee score; and (3) difference in intra-articular biochemical marker concentrations.\n\nResults: There were 49 patients randomized to treatment with PRP and 50 randomized to treatment with HA. No difference was seen between the groups in the primary outcome measure (WOMAC pain score). In the secondary outcome measure, linear contrasts identified a significantly higher IKDC score in the PRP group compared with the HA group at 24 weeks (mean \u00b1 standard error [SE], 65.5 \u00b1 3.6 vs 55.8 \u00b1 3.8, respectively; P = .013) and at final follow-up (52 weeks) (57.6 \u00b1 3.37 vs 46.6 \u00b1 3.76, respectively; P = .003). Linear contrasts also identified a statistically lower VAS score in the PRP group versus the HA group at 24 weeks (mean \u00b1 SE, 34.6 \u00b1 3.24 vs 48.6 \u00b1 3.7, respectively; P = .0096) and 52 weeks (44 \u00b1 4.6 vs 57.3 \u00b1 3.8, respectively; P = .0039). An examination of fixed effects showed that patients with mild OA and a lower body mass index had a statistically significant improvement in outcomes. In the biochemical analysis, differences between groups approached significance for interleukin-1_ (mean \u00b1 SE, 0.14 \u00b1 0.05 pg/mL [PRP] vs 0.34 \u00b1 0.16 pg/mL [HA]; P = .06) and tumor necrosis factor _ (0.08 \u00b1 0.01 pg/mL [PRP] vs 0.2 \u00b1 0.18 pg/mL [HA]; P = .068) at 12-week follow-up.\n\nConclusion: We found no difference between HA and PRP at any time point in the primary outcome measure: the patient-reported WOMAC pain score. Significant improvements were seen in other patient-reported outcome measures, with results favoring PRP over HA. Preceding a significant difference in subjective outcomes favoring PRP, there was a trend toward a decrease in 2 proinflammatory cytokines, which suggest that the anti-inflammatory properties of PRP may contribute to an improvement of symptoms.",

A total of 101 patients received arthroscopic \nrelease (n\u0412\u00a0= 50) or US-guided PRP injections (n\u0412\u00a0= 51). Outcomes were assessed \nusing a visual analog scale for pain, the Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation \n(PRTEE), and a calibrated hand dynamometer for grip strength.\nRESULTS: Both patient groups experienced significant improvement in all \nmeasures. Between-group comparisons showed a significantly higher value in the \nPRP group only for grip strength at week 8 (P\u0412\u00a0= .0073); all other significant \ndifferences were in favor of arthroscopy: overall pain (P\u0412\u00a0= .0021), night pain \n(P\u0412\u00a0= .0013), and PRTEE score (P\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a0.0013) at week 104 and grip strength at weeks \n24, 52, and 104 (all P < .0001). Consumption of rescue pain medication was not \nsignificantly different between the groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that (1) PRP injections and \narthroscopic extensor carpi radialis brevis release are both effective in the \nshort and medium term; (2) PRP patients experienced a significant worsening of \npain at 2\u0412\u00a0years; (3) arthroscopic release ensured better long-term outcomes in \nterms of pain relief and grip strength recovery; and (4) both procedures were \nsafe and well accepted by patients.",

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) seems to achieve equal weight loss as laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), but there is still much debate about the quality of life (QOL) after LSG, mainly concerning the association with gastroesophageal reflux. Our hypothesis is that QOL after LSG is comparable with QOL after LRYGB.\n\nMaterials and methods: Between February 2013 and February 2014, 150 patients were randomized to undergo either LSG or LRYGB in our clinic. Differences in QOL were compared between groups by using multiple QOL questionnaires at follow-up moments preoperatively and 2 and 12 months after surgery.\n\nResults: After 12 months of follow-up, 128 patients had returned the questionnaires. Most QOL questionnaires showed significant improvement in scores between the preoperative moment and after 12 months of follow-up. The Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Questionnaire (GerdQ) score deteriorated in the LSG group after 2 months, but recovered again after 12 months. After 2 months of follow-up, the mean GerdQ score was 6.95 \u00b1 2.14 in the LSG group versus 5.50 \u00b1 1.49 in the LRYGB group (p < 0.001).

The primary aim of the present study was \nto report concise 10-year follow-up results.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the 71 patients in the previous randomized \nclinical trial, comparing clinical outcomes, revisions, reoperations, and \nimplant survivorship between the 2-incision and the mini-posterior THAs.\nRESULTS: At the most recent follow-up, the mean Harris hip score was 85 in the \n2-incision group and 87 in the mini-posterior group (P\u0412\u00a0= .4). There were 4 \nrevisions and 2 reoperations (16%) in the 2-incision group vs 1 revision and 3 \nreoperations (11%) in the mini-posterior group (P\u0412\u00a0= .5). Ten-year survivorship \nfree of aseptic revision or reoperation was 77% in the 2-incision group vs 90% \nin the mini-posterior group (P\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a0.15).\nCONCLUSION: There were no improvements in early or midterm clinical outcomes \nwith the 2-incision technique. However, there was a clinical trend toward a \nhigher rate of aseptic revisions in the 2-incision THA group.",

There is literature supporting that intravenous (IV) acetaminophen reduces postoperative pain and narcotic use in the total joint population. However, there are no studies comparing the effectiveness of IV vs oral (PO) acetaminophen as part of a standard multimodal perioperative pain regimen.\n\nMethods: One hundred twenty patients undergoing hip and knee arthroplasty surgeries performed by one joint arthroplasty surgeon were prospectively randomized into 2 groups. Group 1 (63 patients) received IV and group 2 (57 patients) received PO acetaminophen in addition to a standard multimodal perioperative pain regimen. Each group received 1 gram of acetaminophen preoperatively and then every 6 hours for 24 hours. The primary outcome was total narcotic use. Visual analog scale (VAS) scores were collected every 4 hours postoperatively.\n\nResults: The 24-hour average hydromorphone equivalents given were not different between groups (3.71 vs 3.48) at 24 hours (P = .76). The 24-hour average visual analog scale scores in group 1 (IV) was 3.00 and in group 2 (PO) was 3.40 (P = .06).\n\nConclusion: IV acetaminophen was not more effective than PO acetaminophen in reducing narcotic use in patients undergoing hip and knee arthroplasty surgeries.",

        "abstract": "Background: Multimodal pain management has had a significant effect on improving total joint arthroplasty recovery and patient satisfaction. There is literature supporting that intravenous (IV) acetaminophen reduces postoperative pain and narcotic use in the total joint population. However, there are no studies comparing the effectiveness of IV vs oral (PO) acetaminophen as part of a standard multimodal perioperative pain regimen.\n\nMethods: One hundred twenty patients undergoing hip and knee arthroplasty surgeries performed by one joint arthroplasty surgeon were prospectively randomized into 2 groups. Group 1 (63 patients) received IV and group 2 (57 patients) received PO acetaminophen in addition to a standard multimodal perioperative pain regimen. Each group received 1 gram of acetaminophen preoperatively and then every 6 hours for 24 hours. Total narcotic use and visual analog scale (VAS) scores were collected every 4 hours postoperatively.\n\nResults: The 24-hour average hydromorphone equivalents given were not different between groups (3.71 vs 3.48) at 24 hours (P = .76), or at any of the individual 4-hour intervals. The 24-hour average visual analog scale scores in group 1 (IV) was 3.00 and in group 2 (PO) was 3.40 (P = .06). None of the 4-hour intervals were significantly different except the first interval (0-4 hour postoperatively), which favored the IV group (P = .03).\n\nConclusion: The use of IV acetaminophen may have a role when given intraoperatively to reduce the immediate pain after surgery. Following that, it does not provide a significant benefit in reducing pain or narcotic use when compared with the much less expensive PO form.",

Adverse events occurred in 97% of the 48-hour group and 91% \nof the 24-hour group (difference, 5.6%; 95% CI, 0.6%-10.6%; RR, 1.06; 95% CI, \n1.01-1.12; P = .04). The median length of intensive care unit stay was 151 hours \nin the 48-hour group versus 117 hours in the 24-hour group (P < .001), and \nhospital stay was 11 versus 12 days (P = .50).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Targeted temperature management at 33\u00b0C for 48 hours \nwas not more effective on 6-month neurologic outcome than targeted temperature \nmanagement at 33\u00b0C for 24 hours in unconscious survivors from out-of-hospital \ncardiac arrest admitted to the ICU.",

Participants completed a 4-week smartphone headache diary at baseline, posttreatment (16-20 wk), and follow-up (32-36 wk).

Randomized \ncontrolled trials comparing LP- or LR-PRP with a control alongside ARCR were \nincluded. Clinical outcomes, including retears and functional outcomes, were \ncompared using a frequentist approach to network meta-analysis, with statistical \nanalysis performed using R. The treatment options were ranked using the P-score.\nRESULTS: There were 13 studies (868 patients) included, with 9 studies comparing \nLP-PRP with a control and 4 studies comparing LR-PRP with a control. LP-PRP was \nfound to significantly reduce the rate of retear and/or incomplete tendon \nhealing after fixation, even among medium-large tears; it also improved outcomes \non the visual analog scale for pain, Constant score, and University of \nCalifornia Los Angeles score. LP-PRP had the highest P-score for all treatment \ngroups. LR-PRP did not result in any significant improvements over the control \ngroup, except for visual analog scale score for pain. However, post hoc analysis \nrevealed that LP-PRP did not lead to significant improvements over LR-PRP in any \ncategory.\nCONCLUSION: The current study demonstrates that LP-PRP reduces the rate of \nretear and/or incomplete tendon healing after ARCR and improves patient-reported \noutcomes as compared with a control. However, it is still unclear whether LP-PRP \nimproves the tendon healing rate when compared with LR-PRP.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether leukocyte-poor (LP) or leukocyte-rich (LR) \nvarieties of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) as an adjuvant to arthroscopic rotator \ncuff repair (ARCR) result in improved tendon healing rates.\nPURPOSE: To perform a network meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials \nin the literature to ascertain whether there is evidence to support the use of \nLP- or LR-PRP as an adjunct to ARCR.\nMETHODS: The literature search was based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting \nItems for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Randomized \ncontrolled trials comparing LP- or LR-PRP with a control alongside ARCR were \nincluded. Clinical outcomes, including retears and functional outcomes, were \ncompared using a frequentist approach to network meta-analysis, with statistical \nanalysis performed using R. The treatment options were ranked using the P-score.\nRESULTS: There were 13 studies (868 patients) included, with 9 studies comparing \nLP-PRP with a control and 4 studies comparing LR-PRP with a control. LP-PRP was \nfound to reduce the rate of retear and/or incomplete tendon healing after \nfixation; it also improved outcomes on the visual analog scale for pain, \nConstant score, and University of California Los Angeles score. LP-PRP had the \nhighest P-score for all treatment groups. LR-PRP did not result in any \nsignificant improvements over the control group, except for visual analog scale \nscore for pain. Post hoc analysis revealed that LP-PRP did not lead to \nsignificant improvements over LR-PRP in any category.\nCONCLUSION: LP-PRP was not more effective than LR-PRP in patients undergoing \narthroscopic rotator cuff repair.",
