254,18237696,Prospective randomized comparison of anatomic single- and double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy",  Focus on (+) secondary endpoint,,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Purpose
To determine if anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is superior to anatomic single-bundle reconstruction in restoring the stabilities and functions of the knee joint.
Methods
A prospective randomized clinical study was done to compare the results of 32 cases of anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction and 34 cases of anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction with average follow-up of 16.3 В± 3.1В months. Tunnel placements of all the cases were measured on 3D CT. Clinical results were collected after reconstruction; graft's appearance, meniscus status and cartilage state under arthroscopy were compared and analysed too.
Results
Tunnel placements, confirmed with 3D CT, were in the anatomic positions as described in literature both in SB and DB group. No differences were found between SB and DB groups in clinical outcome scores, pivot shift test and KT 1000В measurements (average side-to-side difference for anterior tibial translation was 0.7В mm in SB group and 1.0В mm in DB group). More than 70 % of the single-bundle graft and AM bundle graft in DB group appeared excellent, but only 44.1 % of PL bundle grafts in DB group were excellent and 11.8 % were in poor state. No new menisci tear was found either in SB or DB group, however, in DB group cartilage damages in medial patella-femoral joint occurred in 38.2 % cases. This rate was significantly higher than in the SB group which is only 9.3 %.
Conclusion
Both single- and double-bundle anatomic ACL reconstruction can restore the knee's stability and functions very well. However, more incidences of poor PL status and medial patellar-femoral cartilage damage may occur in double-bundle ACL reconstruction.",no_spin,"This abstract is not about cancer, it's about ACL reconstruction.

dextrose in normal saline solution compared with normal saline solution will 
lead to a lower proportion of hospitalized patients and a greater reduction in 
serum ketone levels in children with gastroenteritis and dehydration.
METHODS: We enrolled children aged 6 months to 6 years in a double-blind, 
randomized controlled trial of patients presenting to a pediatric emergency 
department. Subjects were randomized to receive a 20 mL/kg infusion of either 5% 
dextrose in normal saline solution or normal saline solution. Serum ketone 
levels were measured before and at 1- and 2-hour intervals after the initial 
study fluid bolus administration. Primary outcome was the proportion of children 
hospitalized. Secondary outcome was change in serum ketone levels over time.
RESULTS: One hundred eighty-eight children were enrolled. The proportion of 
children hospitalized did not differ between groups (35% in the 5% dextrose in 
normal saline solution group versus 44% in the normal saline solution group; 
risk difference 9%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -5% to 22%). Compared with 
children who received normal saline solution, those who received 5% dextrose in 
normal saline solution had a greater reduction in mean serum ketone levels at 
both 1 hour (mean О” 1.2 versus 0.1 mmol/L; mean difference 1.1 mmol/L; 95% CI

1.6 mmol/L; 95% CI 0.9 to 2.3 mmol/L).
CONCLUSION: Administration of a dextrose-containing bolus compared with normal

measures for a novel F(ab)2 antivenom in patients with moderate to severe pain 
caused by black widow spider envenomation.
METHODS: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, clinical trial was 
conducted in 12 academic emergency departments. We included patients at least 10 
years old with moderate to severe latrodectism. Subjects received either a 
single intravenous infusion of antivenom or placebo. Pain was assessed with the 
visual analog scale. The primary efficacy outcome was the difference in pre- and 
posttreatment visual analog scale score. Prospectively defined secondary 
outcomes included treatment failures and time to clinically important decrease

RESULTS: Twenty-four subjects were enrolled between October 2005 and October

Methods: Adult patients treated at one of 3 EDs between November 2010 and September 2011 and prescribed an antibiotic, central nervous system, gastrointestinal, cardiac, or respiratory drug at discharge were eligible. Subjects were randomly assigned to usual care or one of 3 prescription information or services intervention groups: (1) practical services to reduce barriers to prescription filling (practical prescription information or services); (2) consumer drug information from MedlinePlus (MedlinePlus prescription information or services); or (3) both services and information (combination prescription information or services).

Despite intensive marketing by the manufacturers, this claim has not yet been confirmed in a controlled prospective trial.

Questions/purposes: We (1) compared three-planar component alignment and overall coronal mechanical alignment between PSG and conventional instrumentation and (2) logged the need for applying changes in the suggested position of the PSG.

Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, we enrolled 128 patients. The primary outcome was overall coronal mechanical alignment. Secondary outcomes included femoral coronal alignment, femoral axial alignment, tibial coronal alignment, and tibial sagittal alignment. In the PSG cohort, surgical navigation was used as an intraoperative control. When the suggested cut deviated more than 3° from target, the use of PSG was abandoned and marked as an outlier. When cranial-caudal position or size was adapted, the PSG was marked as modified. All patients underwent long-leg standing radiography and CT scan. Deviation of more than 3° from the target in any plane was defined as an outlier.

Results: The PSG and conventional cohorts showed similar numbers of outliers in overall coronal alignment (25% versus 28%; p = 0.69). There were more outliers in tibial coronal (15% versus 3%; p = 0.03) and sagittal (21% versus 3%; p = 0.002) alignment in the PSG group than in the conventional group. The PSG group showed similar outlier rates for femoral coronal alignment (7% versus 14%; p = 0.24) and femoral axial alignment (23% versus 17%; p = 0.50). PSGs were abandoned in 14 patients (22%) and modified in 18 (28%).

Conclusions: PSGs were not more effective than conventional instrumentation for overall coronal mechanical alignment in patients undergoing TKA.",spin,2,2,"[{'token': 17, 'token_string': '2', 'logits': -0.060500748455524445, 'probability': 0.9412930607795715}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -4.6491513785440475e-06, 'probability': 0.9999952912330627}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.7054932117462158, 'probability': 0.49386492371559143}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -4.2199197196168825e-05, 'probability': 0.999957799911499}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.7168208956718445, 'probability': 0.48830217123031616}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -1.2278481335670222e-05, 'probability': 0.9999877214431763}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.2312709093093872, 'probability': 0.29192134737968445}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -1.3112935448589269e-05, 'probability': 0.9999868869781494}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.8444579839706421, 'probability': 0.4297902286052704}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -4.768360213347478e-06, 'probability': 0.999995231628418}]"

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of the two procedures in patients older than 55 years of age affected by reparable rotator cuff tears with concomitant long head biceps pathologies.

Methods: Patients older than 55 years of age with long head biceps lesions and reparable rotator cuff tears were selected for this study. A total of 151 patients were randomly assigned to the tenotomy group (77 patients) or the tenodesis group (74 patients). Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was performed in all the patients. Before surgery, physical and radiological examinations were performed; the constant score was measured as well. After the operation, the surgical time, cost, pain (VAS scores), Popeye sign, cramping pain, constant scores, satisfaction level and the elbow flexion and forearm supination strength indices were recorded.

Results: Patients were followed for an average of 24 months. No significant differences in the clinical results for the constant scores, the forearm supination and elbow flexion strength indices, Popeye sign, cramping pain and satisfaction level were found between the groups. However, tenotomy required a shorter surgical time (40.4 ± 4.0 vs. 50.4 ± 5.9 min, P < 0.001) and resulted in faster pain relief (3.1 ± 1.8 vs. 4.8 ± 1.9, P < 0.001).

Conclusion: Both tenotomy and tenodesis are effective and equal for the treatment of long head biceps lesions.

However, there are unanswered questions about the performance of hemiarthroplasty over the longer term compared with internal fixation.

Questions/purposes: We sought to compare hemiarthroplasty with internal fixation in terms of (1) outcomes scores for pain, hip function, and quality of life at a minimum of 5 years after surgery in a randomized trial. A secondary purpose was to compare (2) patient survival and (3) frequency of reoperation in the two groups.

Methods: A total of 222 consecutive patients older than 60 years, including those cognitively impaired, with FNF were randomized to either internal fixation with two parallel screws or bipolar hemiarthroplasty. At a minimum followup of 4.9 years (mean, 5.9 years; range, 4.9-7.2 years), 68 of the 70 surviving patients were examined by a study nurse and study physiotherapist blinded to initial treatment. Questionnaires on hip function (Harris hip score), quality of life (Eq5D), and activity of daily living function (Barthel ADL) were administered. The Barthel ADL index score was split into good function (score 95 or 100) and reduced function (score below 95).

Results: The mean survival of the groups was similar with 66.4% (73 of 110) of the patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty and 70.5% (79 of 112) of the patients undergoing internal fixation having died since surgery (p = 0.51).

Between 2 and 6 years, there were two new major reoperations (both in the internal fixation group, for avascular necrosis and deep wound infection). The mean Harris hip score was 66 (SD 19) and 67 (SD 20) in the internal fixation and hemiarthroplasty groups, respectively (p = 0.96). The mean Eq5D index was 0.50 (SD 0.40) in the internal fixation group and 0.34 (SD 0.36) in the hemiarthroplasty group (p = 0.10).

278,24136801,The effect of infrapatellar fat pad excision on complications after minimally invasive TKA: a randomized controlled trial.,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,,Claim benefit based on (+) secondary endpoint,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Background: The infrapatellar fat pad is one of the structures that obscures exposure in minimally invasive total knee arthroplasty (MIS TKA). Most MIS TKA surgeons (and many surgeons who use other approaches as well) excise the fat pad for better exposure of the knee. There is still controversy about the result of fat pad excision on patella baja, pain, and function.

Questions/purposes: In the setting of a randomized controlled trial, we sought to determine whether infrapatellar fat pad excision during MIS TKA causes (1) patellar tendon shortening (as measured by patella baja); (2) increased anterior knee pain; (3) decreases in the Knee Society Score or functional subscore; or (4) more patella-related complications.

Methods: We randomized 90 patients undergoing MIS TKA at one institution into two groups. In one group, 45 patients underwent MIS TKA with complete infrapatellar fat pad excision and in the other group, 45 patients received MIS TKA without infrapatellar fat pad excision. The patella was selectively resurfaced in these patients; there was no difference between the groups in terms of the percentage of patients whose patellae were resurfaced. We measured patellar tendon shortening, knee flexion, anterior knee pain, Knee Society Score (KSS), functional subscore, and patellar complications at preoperative and postoperative periods of 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year; complete followup data were available on 86% of patients (77 of 90) who were enrolled.

Results: At the final followup, no significant differences were observed in patellar tendon shortening, KSS, functional subscore, or knee flexion in either group. However, patients with their infrapatellar fat pad excised experienced more anterior knee pain (8.3% versus 0%; p = 0.03; 95% confidence interval, -0.007 to 0.174) at the end of the study. No patellar complications were found in either group.

Conclusions: Infrapatellar fat pad excision in MIS TKA resulted in an increasing small percentage of patients with anterior knee pain after surgery.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We compared the side effect profile, analgesic efficacy, and

infusion of ropivacaine and patients receiving an epidural plus femoral nerve 
block (FNB) after TKA.
METHODS: Ninety-four patients undergoing unilateral TKA were prospectively 
randomized to receive a spinal-epidural analgesic infusion plus a 
single-injection FNB or a spinal anesthetic plus a continuous postoperative 
intraarticular infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine. All patients were blinded to their

concerning side effect profiles (nausea, hypotension), analgesic efficacy (VAS 
pain scores, narcotic usage), and functional recovery (timed up and go test, 
quadriceps strength, WOMAC scores, Knee Society scores, early postoperative 
ambulatory ability, in-hospital falls). All complications and adverse events 
were recorded.
RESULTS: The frequency of nausea and hypertension was not different between the 
study groups. During the first 12 and 24 postoperative hours, the mean maximum 
VAS pain scores were higher in the ropivacaine group than in the epidural group

versus 1.93, respectively, p = 0.008). After 24 hours, pain scores were similar 
between groups. Narcotic consumption was higher in the ropivacaine 
group on the day of surgery, but overall in-hospital narcotic usage was similar

recovery between groups at any time point. Patients in the epidural group 
were more likely to have knee buckling (32.7% versus 6.7%, p = 0.002) and

56,24204974,A randomized controlled trial of storytelling as a communication tool.,PLOS ONE,,Claim benefit based on (+) secondary endpoint,Emergency Medicine,claude_4.0-sonnet,"INTRODUCTION: Stories may be an effective tool to communicate with patients 
because of their ability to engage the reader. Our objective was to evaluate the 
effectiveness of story booklets compared to standard information sheets for 
parents of children attending the emergency department (ED) with a child with 
croup.
METHODS: Parents were randomized to receive story booklets (n=208) or standard 
information sheets (n=205) during their ED visit. The primary outcome was change 
in anxiety between triage to ED discharge as measured by the State-Trait Anxiety 
Inventory. Follow-up telephone interviews were conducted at 1 and 3 days after 
discharge, then every other day until 9 days (or until resolution of symptoms), 
and at 1 year. Secondary outcomes included: expected future anxiety, event 
impact, parental knowledge, satisfaction, decision regret, healthcare 
utilization, time to symptom resolution.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the primary outcome of change in 
parental anxiety between recruitment and ED discharge (change of 5 points for 
the story group vs. 6 points for the comparison group, p=0.78). The story group 
showed significantly greater decision regret regarding their decision to go to 
the ED (p<0.001): 6.7% of the story group vs. 1.5% of the comparison group 
strongly disagreed with the statement ""I would go for the same choice if I had 
to do it over again"". The story group reported shorter time to resolution of 
symptoms (mean 3.7 days story group vs. 4.0 days comparison group, median 3 days 
both groups; log rank test, p=0.04). No other outcomes were different between 
study groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Stories about parent experiences managing a child with croup did 
not reduce parental anxiety. The story group showed significantly greater 
decision regret and quicker time to resolution of symptoms. Further research is 
needed to better understand whether stories can be effective in improving 
patient-important outcomes.",no_spin,4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.7603487968444824, 'probability': 0.4675033390522003}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -4.768360213347478e-06, 'probability': 0.999995231628418}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.03934388980269432, 'probability': 0.961419939994812}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -1.3351351299206726e-05, 'probability': 0.9999865889549255}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.21151277422904968, 'probability': 0.8093589544296265}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -5.483612312673358e-06, 'probability': 0.9999944567680359}]",0,0,"[{'token': 15, 'token_string': '0', 'logits': -0.5022019147872925, 'probability': 0.6051965951919556}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0015525680501013994, 'probability': 0.9984486103057861}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.22890371084213257, 'probability': 0.7954050898551941}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -4.410734163684538e-06, 'probability': 0.9999955892562866}]"

utilize emergency departments (EDs) for acute and chronic care. We seek to 
determine whether a scalable, low-cost, unidirectional, text message-based 
mobile health intervention (TExT-MED) improves clinical outcomes, increases 
healthy behaviors, and decreases ED utilization in a safety net population.
METHODS: We conducted an randomized controlled trial of 128 adult patients with 
poorly controlled diabetes (glycosylated hemoglobin [Hb A1C] level в‰Ґ8%) in an 
urban, public ED. The TExT-MED group received 2 daily text messages for 6 months 
in English or Spanish. The primary outcome was change in Hb A1C level. Secondary 
outcomes included changes in medication adherence, self-efficacy, performance of 
self-care tasks, quality of life, diabetes-specific knowledge, ED utilization, 
and patient satisfaction.
RESULTS: Hb A1C level decreased by 1.05% in the TExT-MED group compared with 
0.60% in the controls (О”0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.27 to 1.17) at 6 
months. Secondary outcomes favored the TExT-MED group, with the most sizable 
change observed in self-reported medication adherence (as measured by the 
Morisky Medication Adherence Scale, an 8-point validated scale with higher 
scores representing better adherence), which improved from 4.5 to 5.4 in the 
TExT-MED group compared with a net decrease of -0.1 in the controls (О”1.1 [95% 
CI 0.1 to 2.1]). Effects were larger among Spanish speakers for both medication 
adherence (1.1 versus -0.3; О”1.4; 95% CI 0.2 to 2.7) and Hb A1C (-1.2% versus 
-0.4%) in the TExT-MED group. The proportion of patients who used emergency 
services trended lower in the TExT-MED group (35.9% versus 51.6%; О”15.7%; 95% CI 
9.4% to 22%). Overall, 93.6% of respondents enjoyed TExT-MED and 100% would 
recommend it to family/friends.
CONCLUSION: The TExT-MED program did not result in a statistically significant 
improvement in Hb A1C. However, trends toward improvement in the primary outcome 
of Hb A1C and other secondary outcomes, including quality of life, were 
observed, the most pronounced being improved medication adherence. TExT-MED also 
decreased ED utilization. These findings were magnified in the Spanish-speaking 
subgroup. Technologies such as TExT-MED represent highly scalable, low-cost, and 
widely accessible solutions for safety-net ED populations.",no_spin,7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -0.7586550116539001, 'probability': 0.4682958424091339}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -1.2159273865108844e-05, 'probability': 0.9999878406524658}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.01012333668768406, 'probability': 0.9899277091026306}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -2.9682672902708873e-05, 'probability': 0.9999703764915466}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.7946805357933044, 'probability': 0.4517255127429962}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -1.07287787614041e-05, 'probability': 0.9999892115592957}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.34078603982925415, 'probability': 0.7112110257148743}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -7.152531907195225e-06, 'probability': 0.9999929070472717}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.3718639612197876, 'probability': 0.6894480586051941}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -8.22540732769994e-06, 'probability': 0.999991774559021}]"

59,24282495,Randomised controlled trial of joint crisis plans to reduce compulsory treatment for people with psychosis: economic outcomes.,PLOS ONE,,"Focus on another objective (e.g., trial is (-) but they say they accomplish some goal that they did not prespecify)",Emergency Medicine,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Compulsory admission to psychiatric hospitals may be distressing, 
disruptive to patients and families, and associated with considerable cost to 
the health service. Improved patient experience and cost reductions could be 
realised by providing cost-effective crisis planning services.
METHODS: Economic evaluation within a multi-centre randomised controlled trial 
comparing Joint Crisis Plans (JCP) plus treatment as usual (TAU) to TAU alone 
for patients aged over 16, with at least one psychiatric hospital admission in 
the previous two years and on the Enhanced Care Programme Approach register. 
JCPs, containing the patient's treatment preferences for any future psychiatric 
emergency, are a form of crisis intervention that aim to mitigate the negative 
consequences of relapse, including hospital admission and use of coercion. Data 
were collected at baseline and 18-months after randomisation. The primary 
outcome was admission to hospital under the Mental Health Act. The economic 
evaluation took a service perspective (health, social care and criminal justice 
services) and a societal perspective (additionally including criminal activity 
and productivity losses).
FINDINGS: The addition of JCPs to TAU had no significant effect on compulsory 
admissions or total societal cost per participant over 18-months follow-up. From 
the service cost perspective, JCPs were not significantly more cost-effective 
than TAU alone.
INTERPRETATION: JCPs were not more effective than TAU alone in reducing 
compulsory admissions in patients with previous psychiatric hospital admissions.",spin,0,0,"[{'token': 15, 'token_string': '0', 'logits': -0.7061693072319031, 'probability': 0.49353116750717163}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -2.109982233378105e-05, 'probability': 0.9999788403511047}]",10,10,"[{'token': 605, 'token_string': '10', 'logits': -0.3593393564224243, 'probability': 0.6981373429298401}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -7.986990567587782e-06, 'probability': 0.9999920725822449}]","This abstract is not about cancer, it's about crisis planning services for patients with psychiatric hospital admissions.

58,24282495,Randomised controlled trial of joint crisis plans to reduce compulsory treatment for people with psychosis: economic outcomes.,PLOS ONE,,"Focus on another objective (e.g., trial is (-) but they say they accomplish some goal that they did not prespecify)",Emergency Medicine,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Compulsory admission to psychiatric hospitals may be distressing, 
disruptive to patients and families, and associated with considerable cost to 
the health service. Improved patient experience and cost reductions could be 
realised by providing cost-effective crisis planning services.
METHODS: Economic evaluation within a multi-centre randomised controlled trial 
comparing Joint Crisis Plans (JCP) plus treatment as usual (TAU) to TAU alone 
for patients aged over 16, with at least one psychiatric hospital admission in 
the previous two years and on the Enhanced Care Programme Approach register. 
JCPs, containing the patient's treatment preferences for any future psychiatric 
emergency, are a form of crisis intervention that aim to mitigate the negative 
consequences of relapse, including hospital admission and use of coercion. Data 
were collected at baseline and 18-months after randomisation. The primary 
outcome was admission to hospital under the Mental Health Act. The economic 
evaluation took a service perspective (health, social care and criminal justice 
services) and a societal perspective (additionally including criminal activity 
and productivity losses).
FINDINGS: The addition of JCPs to TAU had no significant effect on compulsory 
admissions or total societal cost per participant over 18-months follow-up. From 
the service cost perspective, however, evidence suggests a higher probability 
(80%) of JCPs being the more cost-effective option. Exploration by ethnic group 
highlights distinct patterns of costs and effects. Whilst the evidence does not 
support the cost-effectiveness of JCPs for White or Asian ethnic groups, there 
is at least a 90% probability of the JCP intervention being the more 
cost-effective option in the Black ethnic group.
INTERPRETATION: The results by ethnic group are sufficiently striking to warrant 
further investigation into the potential for patient gain from JCPs among black 
patient groups.",no_spin,6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.0445371866226196, 'probability': 0.3518546521663666}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -6.794906312279636e-06, 'probability': 0.9999931454658508}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.04231029748916626, 'probability': 0.9585722088813782}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -8.821448318485636e-06, 'probability': 0.999991238117218}]","This abstract is not about cancer, it's about crisis planning services for psychiatric patients.

METHODS: All highest-level alert patients with at least one measurement of 
systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg, a mean arterial pressure less than 
60 mm Hg, and/or a heart rate greater than 120 beats per minute who arrived to 
the trauma bay (TB) were randomized to have either LTTE performed (LTTEp) or not 
performed (non-LTTE) as part of their initial evaluation. Images were stored, 
and results were reported regarding contractility (good vs. poor), fluid status 
(empty inferior vena cava [hypovolemic] vs. full inferior vena cava [not 
hypovolemic]), and pericardial effusion (present vs. absent). The primary outcome 
was mortality. Secondary outcomes included time from TB to operating room, 
intravenous fluid administration, blood product requirement, and intensive care 
unit admission.
RESULTS: A total of 240 patients were randomized. Twenty-five patients were 
excluded since they died upon arrival to the TB, leaving 215 patients in the 
study. Ninety-two patients were in the LTTEp group with 123 patients in the 
non-LTTE group. The LTTEp and non-LTTE groups were similar in age (38 years vs. 
38.8 years, p = 0.75), Injury Severity Score (ISS) (19.2 vs. 19.0, p = 0.94), 
Revised Trauma Score (RTS) (5.5 vs. 6.0, p = 0.09), lactate (4.2 vs. 3.6, p =

non-LTTE patients (1.5 L vs. 2.5 L, p < 0.0001), less time from TB to operating 
room (35.6 minutes vs. 79.1 min, p = 0.0006), higher rate of intensive care unit 
admission (80.4% vs. 67.2%, p = 0.04), and a mortality rate of 11% vs. 19.5% (p =

posterior-cruciate-ligament-stabilized (PS) arthroplasties are two major common 
practices in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The hypothesis of the present study 
was that compared with the PCR technique, the PS technique is associated with a 
higher amount of postoperative blood loss and greater need for blood transfusion 
in cemented TKA.
METHODS: In this prospective, randomized study, 100 patients diagnosed with 
primary knee osteoarthritis were randomly assigned to either the PCR group 
(Group I) or the PS group (Group II). The exclusion criteria were 
rheumatological joint disease, previous knee surgery, anticoagulant therapy and 
hypertension. There were no significant differences in age, body mass index and 
gender, between the groups. The haemoglobin and haematocrit levels of each 
patient were recorded preoperatively and on postoperative days 1, 3 and 5. The 
postoperative suction drainage and blood transfusion volumes were also recorded.
RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in haemoglobin or 
haematocrit levels between the groups on postoperative days 1, 3 and 5. There 
were also no statistically significant differences in the total measured blood 
loss volume, postoperative drainage amounts or transfusion rates between the

CONCLUSION: Use of the PS technique during cemented TKA does not appear to 
influence the amount of perioperative blood loss or the need for postoperative 
blood transfusion in general. The clinical relevance of this study is that the 
difference in blood loss between the PCR and PS techniques does not need to be

Methods:В In a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial, 29 patients were divided in two groups: for Group 1 patients, surgical closing was performed with the knee extended, and for Group 2 patients, the knee flexed at 90В°. All the patients were treated with the same anaesthesia method, surgical team, surgical technique, prosthesis type, and rehabilitation process. American Knee Society Score values and knee flexion degrees were recorded. Isokinetic muscle strength measurements of both knees in flexion and extension were taken using 60В° and 180В°/s angular velocity. The peak torque and total work values, isokinetic muscle strength differences, and total work difference values were calculated for surgically repaired and healthy knees.
Results:В No significant difference in the mean American Knee Society Score values and knee flexion degrees was observed between the two groups.

Methods: In a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial, 29 patients were divided in two groups: for Group 1 patients, surgical closing was performed with the knee extended, and for Group 2 patients, the knee flexed at 90°. All the patients were treated with the same anaesthesia method, surgical team, surgical technique, prosthesis type, and rehabilitation process. The primary outcome was American Knee Society Score values. Secondary outcomes included knee flexion degrees and isokinetic muscle strength measurements of both knees in flexion and extension using 60° and 180°/s angular velocity. The peak torque and total work values, isokinetic muscle strength differences, and total work difference values were calculated for surgically repaired and healthy knees.
Results: No significant difference in the mean American Knee Society Score values was observed between the two groups. No significant difference in knee flexion degrees was observed between the two groups. Using isokinetic evaluation, a significant difference was found in the isokinetic muscle strength differences and total work difference of the flexor muscle between the two groups when patients were tested at 180°/s. Group 2 showed -4.2% change in isokinetic muscle strength differences of the flexor muscle compared to -23.1% in Group 1.
Conclusion: Knee flexion during wound closure was not more effective than knee extension on American Knee Society Score in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.",spin,2,2,"[{'token': 17, 'token_string': '2', 'logits': -0.34026744961738586, 'probability': 0.7115799784660339}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -4.768360213347478e-06, 'probability': 0.999995231628418}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.15837591886520386, 'probability': 0.8535288572311401}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -1.0251946150674485e-05, 'probability': 0.9999896883964539}]",2,2,"[{'token': 17, 'token_string': '2', 'logits': -0.8783235549926758, 'probability': 0.41547882556915283}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -6.198863957251888e-06, 'probability': 0.9999938607215881}]","This abstract is not about cancer, it's about total knee arthroplasty.

Although positive effects were found after physiotherapy, the recurrence and prolonged disability of a frozen shoulder are major factors to focus on to provide the appropriate treatment.

Questions/purposes: We wished to study the effectiveness of a shoulder countertraction apparatus on ROM, pain, and function in patients with a frozen shoulder and compare their results with those of control subjects who received conventional physiotherapy.

Methods: A total of 100 participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group and a control group, with each group having 50 participants. The control group received physiotherapy and the experimental group received countertraction and physiotherapy. The total treatment time was 20 minutes a day for 5 days per week for 2 weeks. The outcome measures used were goniometer measurements, VAS, and the Oxford Shoulder Score.

Results: Improvements were seen in the scores for shoulder flexion (94.1Ў ± 19.79Ў at baseline increased to 161.9Ў ± 13.05Ў after intervention), abduction ROM (90.4Ў ± 21.18Ў at baseline increased to 154.8Ў ± 13.21Ў after intervention), and pain (8.00 ± 0.78 at baseline decreased to 3.48 ± 0.71 after intervention) in the experimental group.

Methods: Between January 2007 and January 2011, 87 patients who underwent arthroscopic Bankart repair with the use of knot-tying suture anchors or knotless suture anchors were evaluated, with 45 patients in the knot-tying suture group and 42 patients in the knotless group. Patients were assigned to either group, with odd-numbered patients going to the knot-tying suture arm and even-numbered patients assigned to the knotless arm. Outcomes included the Constant score, the visual analog scale (VAS) score, patient satisfaction score, and range of motion in forward flexion and external rotation with the arm in adduction. Redislocations or subluxations with the 2 techniques was also studied.

Results: Both groups showed a statistically significant improvement between the preoperative and postoperative VAS scores and Constant scores. In the knot-tying suture group, the VAS score improved from 2.5 ± 2.3 to 0.7 ± 0.5 (P < .05) and the Constant score improved from 64 ± 7 to 92 ± 10 (P < .05). In the knotless group, the VAS score improved from 2.8 ± 2.5 to 0.9 ± 0.6 (P < .05), and the Constant score improved from 62 ± 6 to 89 ± 9 (P < .05). The patient satisfaction scores were 6.9 and 7.1 for the knot tying and knotless groups, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found when comparing the outcomes between the 2 groups. The change in the range of forward flexion and external rotation was also similar in the 2 groups. There was also no difference in recurrence or redislocation rates.

Conclusions: Both the knot-tying and knotless suture anchors groups showed statistically significant and similar improvement in VAS and Constant scores. Both anchors provided reasonable outcomes.

However, recent basic science and clinical data have suggested recurrent instability may be reduced with immobilization in external rotation after primary shoulder dislocation.

Questions/purposes: We performed a randomized controlled trial to compare the (1) frequency of recurrent instability and (2) disease-specific quality-of-life scores after treatment of first-time shoulder dislocation using either immobilization in external rotation or immobilization in internal rotation in a group of young patients.

Methods: Sixty patients younger than 35 years of age with primary, traumatic, anterior shoulder dislocations were randomized (concealed, computer-generated) to immobilization with either an internal rotation sling (n = 29) or an external rotation brace (n = 31) at a mean of 4 days after closed reduction (range, 1-7 days). Patients with large bony lesions or polytrauma were excluded. The two groups were similar at baseline. Both groups were immobilized for 4 weeks with identical therapy protocols thereafter. Blinded assessments were completed by independent observers for a minimum of 12 months (mean, 25 months; range, 12-43 months). The primary outcome was recurrent instability, defined as a second documented anterior dislocation or multiple episodes of shoulder subluxation severe enough for the patient to request surgical stabilization. Secondary outcomes included validated disease-specific quality-of-life data (Western Ontario Shoulder Instability index [WOSI], American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons evaluation [ASES]).

Results: There was no difference in the rate of recurrent instability between groups: 10 of 27 patients (37%) with the external rotation brace versus 10 of 25 patients (40%) with the sling redislocated or developed symptomatic recurrent instability (p = 0.41).

PURPOSE: To report the short-term clinical outcomes of patients undergoing 
arthroscopic repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears with and without 
acromioplasty.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: Patients undergoing arthroscopic repair of full-thickness rotator cuff 
tears were randomized into acromioplasty or nonacromioplasty groups. The primary 
outcome was the Simple Shoulder Test (SST). Secondary outcomes included American 
Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, Constant score, University of

events.
RESULTS: Of 270 recruited patients, 258 (95.6%) were available for analysis. Of

kinetic chain resistance training on anterior knee laxity and function in the 
ACL-injured (ACLI) knee.
METHODS: Fifty-eight ACLI subjects were randomised to one of three (12-week 
duration) training groups. The STAND group trained according to a standardised 
rehabilitation protocol. Subjects in the LOW and HIGH group trained as did the 
STAND group but with the addition of seated knee extensor open kinetic chain 
resistance training at loads of 2 sets of 20 repetition maximum (RM) and 20 sets 
of 2RM, respectively. Anterior knee laxity and measurements of physical and 
subjective function were performed at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks. Thirty-six 
subjects were tested at both baseline and 12 weeks (STAND n = 13, LOW n = 11, 
HIGH n = 12).
RESULTS: The LOW group demonstrated a reduction in 133 N anterior knee laxity 
between baseline and 12 weeks testing when compared to the HIGH and the STAND 
groups (p = 0.009). Specifically, the trained-untrained knee laxity decreased an 
average of approximately 5 mm in the LOW group while remaining the same in the 
other two groups.
CONCLUSION: Twelve weeks of knee extensor open kinetic chain resistance training 
at loads of 2 sets of 20RM led to a reduction in anterior knee laxity in the 
ACLI knee. This reduction in laxity does not appear to offer any significant 
short-term functional advantages when compared to a standard rehabilitation

prevention of venous stasis by transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation

METHODS: Ninety patients undergoing primary TKA were involved and randomly 
allocated to the TENS or control group. In the TENS group, electrical 
stimulation of the common fibular nerve, which produced a brisk dorsiflexion of 
the ankle, was performed for the operated leg during surgery. In the control 
group, no electrical stimulation was applied. The primary outcome was the incidence of DVT assessed by ultrasonography on post-operative day (POD) 1. Secondary outcomes included serum D-dimer and soluble fibrin monomer complex (SFMC) levels measured before surgery, immediately after surgery, and POD 1.
RESULTS: The incidence of DVT was 11% (5/45 cases) in the TENS group and 31% (14/45 cases) in the control group (p = 0.02). Immediately after surgery, D-dimer and SFMC levels were lower in the TENS group compared with control (p < 0.05). There were no adverse effects related to TENS.

develop during total joint arthroplasty. Previously, we reported effective 
prevention of venous stasis by transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation

limb undergoing surgery. The purpose of this study is to clarify the clinical 
efficacy and safety of TENS in patients during total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
METHODS: Ninety patients undergoing primary TKA were involved and randomly

Sustaining muscle pump activation during surgery prevented not only venous

206,24964886,Fluoroscopy and imageless navigation enable an equivalent reconstruction of leg length and global and femoral offset in THA.,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Restoration of biomechanics is a major goal in THA. Imageless 
navigation enables intraoperative control of leg length equalization and offset 
reconstruction. However, the effect of navigation compared with intraoperative 
fluoroscopy is unclear.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether intraoperative use of imageless navigation 
(1) improves the relative accuracy of leg length and global and femoral offset 
restoration; (2) increases the absolute precision of leg length and global and 
femoral offset equalization; and (3) reduces outliers in a reconstruction zone 
of В± 5 mm for leg length and global and femoral offset restoration compared with 
intraoperative fluoroscopy during minimally invasive (MIS) THA with the patient 
in a lateral decubitus position.
METHODS: In this prospective study a consecutive series of 125 patients were 
randomized to either navigation-guided or fluoroscopy-controlled THA using 
sealed, opaque envelopes. All patients received the same cementless prosthetic 
components through an anterolateral MIS approach while they were in a lateral 
decubitus position. Leg length, global or total offset (representing the 
combination of femoral and acetabular offset), and femoral offset differences 
were restored using either navigation or fluoroscopy. Postoperatively, residual 
leg length and global and femoral offset discrepancies were analyzed on 
magnification-corrected radiographs of the pelvis by an independent and blinded 
examiner using digital planning software. Accuracy was defined as the relative 
postoperative difference between the surgically treated and the unaffected 
contralateral side for leg length and offset, respectively; precision was 
defined as the absolute postoperative deviation of leg length and global and 
femoral offset regardless of lengthening or shortening of leg length and offset 
throughout the THA. All analyses were performed per intention-to-treat.
RESULTS: Analyzing the relative accuracy of leg length restoration we found a 
mean difference of 0.2 mm (95% CI, -1.0 to +1.4 mm; p = 0.729) between 
fluoroscopy and navigation, 0.2 mm (95 % CI, -0.9 to +1.3 mm; p = 0.740) for 
global offset and 1.7 mm (95 % CI, +0.4 to +2.9 mm; p = 0.008) for femoral 
offset. For the absolute precision of leg length and global and femoral offset 
equalization, there was a mean difference of 1.7 В± 0.3 mm (p < 0.001) between 
fluoroscopy and navigation. The biomechanical reconstruction with a residual leg 
length and global and femoral offset discrepancy less than 5 mm and less than 8 
mm, respectively, succeeded in 93% and 98%, respectively, in the navigation 
group and in 54% and 95%, respectively, in the fluoroscopy group.

METHODS: In a multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial of redback spider 
antivenom for latrodectism, 224 patients (>7 years) with a redback spider bite 
and severe pain, with or without systemic effects, were randomized to receive 
normal saline solution (placebo) or antivenom after receiving standardized

Intravenous morphine has been used as a common method of pain control in emergency care. NebulizedВ fentanylВ is also an effective temporary substitute. This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of nebulized fentanyl with intravenous (IV) morphine on management of acute limb pain.
Methods
This was a placebo-controlled, double-blindВ randomized clinical trial. Ninety emergency department patients with moderate to severe pain aged 15 to 50 years were blocked randomized and enrolled in this study. Forty-seven patients in the experimental group received nebulized fentanyl (4В Ојg/kg) and IV normal saline as placebo, and the remaining 43 patients in the control group received IV morphine (0.1 mg/kg) and nebulized normal saline as placebo.

emergency departments and is associated with important health expenses. However, 
the appropriate care of this traumatic injury remains a matter of debate. We 
tested the hypothesis that compression stockings speed up recovery from ankle 
sprain.
METHODS: Recent (<48 hours) cases of ankle sprain without other traumatic injury 
in patients aged between 18 and 55 years were included. Patients were randomly 
allocated to placebo Jersey or class II compression stockings (Venoflex;

recovery of normal painless walking without requirement for analgesic drug. 
Secondary end points were time to return to sport activity, pain, analgesic 
consumption, and ankle edema (bimalleolar and midfoot circumferences).
RESULTS: We randomized 126 patients and analyzed 117 patients (60 in the placebo 
group and 57 in the compression group). The median time to normal painless 
walking was not significantly decreased (P = .16). No significant differences 
were observed in pain, analgesic consumption, and bimalleloar and midfoot 
circumferences. No safety issue was reported. In the subgroup of patients with 
regular sport activity, the time to return to sport activity was shorter in 
patients treated with compression stockings (P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS: Compression stockings failed to significantly modify the time to 
return to normal painless walking in ankle sprain. A beneficial effect was 
observed only in a subgroup of patients, as compression stockings significantly 
decreased the time to return to sport activity.",no_spin,"This abstract is not about cancer, it's about ankle sprain. However, I'll answer the question as requested.

43,25043629,Compression stockings in ankle sprain: a multicenter randomized study.,The American Journal of Emergency Medicine,RESULTS: Focus on (+) subgroup analysis,Claim benefit based on (+) subgroup analysis,Emergency Medicine,claude_4.0-sonnet,"OBJECTIVES: Ankle sprain is a frequently encountered traumatic injury in 
emergency departments and is associated with important health expenses. However, 
the appropriate care of this traumatic injury remains a matter of debate. We 
tested the hypothesis that compression stockings speed up recovery from ankle 
sprain.
METHODS: Recent (<48 hours) cases of ankle sprain without other traumatic injury 
in patients aged between 18 and 55 years were included. Patients were randomly 
allocated to placebo Jersey or class II compression stockings (Venoflex; 
Thuasne, Levallois-Perret, France). The primary end point was the time to 
recovery of normal painless walking without requirement for analgesic drug. 
Secondary end points were time to return to sport activity, pain, analgesic 
consumption, and ankle edema (bimalleolar and midfoot circumferences).
RESULTS: We randomized 126 patients and analyzed 117 patients (60 in the placebo 
group and 57 in the compression group). The median time to normal painless 
walking was not significantly decreased (P = .16). No significant differences 
were observed in pain, analgesic consumption, and bimalleolar and midfoot 
circumferences. No safety issue was reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Compression stockings were not more effective than placebo in 
reducing time to recovery of normal painless walking in patients with ankle 
sprain.",spin,"This abstract is not about cancer, it's about ankle sprain. However, I'll still answer the question.

in subjects undergoing assessment for acute angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitor-induced angioedema (ACEIA) in an emergency department (ED).
METHODS: This was a multicenter, phase 2, double-blind study with subjects 
randomized to receive a single subcutaneous dose of ecallantide (10, 30, or 60 
mg) or placebo plus physician-directed conventional therapy. The primary 
endpoint was defined as meeting predetermined discharge eligibility criteria 
within 6 hours of study drug administration. Discharge criteria included 
improvement of edema, stable vital signs, absence of stridor, absence of dyspnea 
or use of accessory muscles during respiration, absence of drooling, and ability 
to drink without difficulty.
RESULTS: An interim analysis showed that a high percentage of subjects met the 
primary endpoint, and the study was halted. Overall, 79 subjects were randomized 
and 76 had data for analysis. Most had mild (45%) or moderate (42%) ACEIA. The 
discharge eligibility endpoint was met by 72% of the placebo group and 85%, 89%, 
and 89% of the ecallantide 10-, 30-, and 60-mg groups, respectively. This 
difference in meeting discharge eligibility endpoint criteria between treatment 
groups was not statistically significant. The incidence of treatment-emergent 
adverse events was similar between placebo and active-treatment groups.
CONCLUSION: The addition of ecallantide to standard therapy does not appear to 
improve angioedema compared with placebo in ED patients with ACEIA. Our data 
suggest that most ED patients presenting with mild to moderate ACEIA are likely 
to meet our discharge eligibility criteria within 6 hours of treatment, 
regardless of intervention. Further studies to assess the utility of ecallantide 
in patients with more severe angioedema may be useful. No new safety signals

METHODS: The study randomly allocated 32 patients (13 women), mean age 63 years 
(range, 39-82 years), with shoulder osteoarthritis to a Copeland (n = 14) or

was measured preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively.
RESULTS: At 2 years, total translation (TT) was 0.48 mm (standard deviation

298,25362247,Will a single periarticular lidocaine-corticosteroid injection improve the clinical efficacy of intraarticular hyaluronic acid treatment of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis?,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy",,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Purpose: A local injection of corticosteroid-lidocaine into the periarticular soft tissue structures is used commonly for rapid pain relief. It is hypothesized that knee pain associated with knee osteoarthritis would be relieved quickly and effectively in patients receiving intraarticular hyaluronic acid combined with a periarticular lidocaine-corticosteroid injection. To test this hypothesis, the clinical effect of the combined treatment with hyaluronic acid injection alone in patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis as compared in this prospective single-blinded randomized trial.

Methods: This study included 70 patients. Group 1 (n = 35) received intraarticular hyaluronic acid injections only, whereas group 2 (n = 35) received intraarticular hyaluronic acid injections combined with a single local injection of corticosteroid-lidocaine.

ganglion block for the treatment of acute anterior headache in the emergency 
department (ED) using a novel noninvasive delivery device.
METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial 
evaluating bupivacaine anesthesia of the sphenopalatine ganglion for acute 
anterior or global-based headache. This study was completed in 2 large academic 
EDs. Bupivacaine or normal saline solution was delivered intranasally (0.3 mL 
per side) with the Tx360 device. Pain and nausea were measured at 0, 5, and 15 
minutes by a 100-mm visual analog scale. The primary endpoint was a 50% 
reduction in pain at 15 minutes. Telephone follow-up assessed 24-hour pain and 
nausea through a 0- to 10-point verbal scale and adverse effects.
RESULTS: The median reported baseline pain in the bupivacaine group was 80 mm 
(IQR 66 mm - 93 mm) and 78.5 mm (IQR 64 mm to 91.75 mm) in the normal saline 
solution group. A 50% reduction in pain was achieved in 48.8% of the bupivacaine 
group (20/41 patients) versus 41.3% in the normal saline solution group (19/46 
patients), for an absolute risk difference of 7.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 
-13% to 27.1%). As a secondary outcome, at 24 hours, more patients in the 
bupivacaine group were headache free (24.7% difference; 95% CI 2.6% to 43.6%) 
and more were nausea free (16.9% difference; 95% CI 0.8% to 32.5%).
CONCLUSION: For patients with acute anterior headache, sphenopalatine ganglion 
block with the Tx360 device with bupivacaine did not result in a significant

ganglion block for the treatment of acute anterior headache in the emergency 
department (ED) using a novel noninvasive delivery device.
METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial 
evaluating bupivacaine anesthesia of the sphenopalatine ganglion for acute 
anterior or global-based headache. This study was completed in 2 large academic 
EDs. Bupivacaine or normal saline solution was delivered intranasally (0.3 mL 
per side) with the Tx360 device. Pain and nausea were measured at 0, 5, and 15 
minutes by a 100-mm visual analog scale. The primary endpoint was a 50% 
reduction in pain at 15 minutes. Telephone follow-up assessed 24-hour pain and 
nausea through a 0- to 10-point verbal scale and adverse effects.
RESULTS: The median reported baseline pain in the bupivacaine group was 80 mm 
(IQR 66 mm - 93 mm) and 78.5 mm (IQR 64 mm to 91.75 mm) in the normal saline 
solution group. A 50% reduction in pain was achieved in 48.8% of the bupivacaine 
group (20/41 patients) versus 41.3% in the normal saline solution group (19/46 
patients), for an absolute risk difference of 7.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 
-13% to 27.1%). At 24 hours, 24.7% more patients in the bupivacaine group were 
headache free (95% CI 2.6% to 43.6%) and 16.9% more were nausea free (95% CI 
0.8% to 32.5%).
CONCLUSION: Sphenopalatine ganglion block with bupivacaine was not more effective 
on 50% reduction in pain at 15 minutes than normal saline solution in patients

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: From August 2008 to December 2009, a total of 56 consecutive patients 
(58 shoulders) were included. All patients had either a full-thickness or 
high-grade (>50%) RC tear, ACJ tenderness, arthritic change visible on plain 
radiographs, and a positive ACJ lidocaine injection test the day before surgery. 
Patients were randomized into 2 groups: DCR and RC repair (DCR+RCR group) and RC 
repair only (isolated RCR). Evaluation was performed preoperatively, at 6 months 
postoperatively, and at a final follow-up a minimum of 24 months postoperatively 
using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, the Constant 
shoulder score, range of motion examination, and pain visual analog scale (VAS).
RESULTS: After simple randomization, 26 shoulders were allocated in the DCR+RCR 
group, and 32 were placed in the isolated RCR group. Five shoulders in the 
DCR+RCR group and 6 in the isolated RCR group were excluded from analysis due to

Earlier transfusion with higher blood product ratios (plasma, platelets, and red blood cells), defined as damage control resuscitation, has been associated with improved outcomes; however, there have been no large multicenter clinical trials.

Objective: To determine the effectiveness and safety of transfusing patients with severe trauma and major bleeding using plasma, platelets, and red blood cells in a 1:1:1 ratio compared with a 1:1:2 ratio.

Design, setting, and participants: Pragmatic, phase 3, multisite, randomized clinical trial of 680 severely injured patients who arrived at 1 of 12 level I trauma centers in North America directly from the scene and were predicted to require massive transfusion between August 2012 and December 2013.

Interventions: Blood product ratios of 1:1:1 (338 patients) vs 1:1:2 (342 patients) during active resuscitation in addition to all local standard-of-care interventions (uncontrolled).

Main outcomes and measures: Primary outcomes were 24-hour and 30-day all-cause mortality. Prespecified ancillary outcomes included time to hemostasis, blood product volumes transfused, complications, incidence of surgical procedures, and functional status.

Results: No significant differences were detected in mortality at 24 hours (12.7% in 1:1:1 group vs 17.0% in 1:1:2 group; difference, -4.2% [95% CI, -9.6% to 1.1%]; P = .12) or at 30 days (22.4% vs 26.1%, respectively; difference, -3.7% [95% CI, -10.2% to 2.7%]; P = .26).

Earlier transfusion with higher blood product ratios (plasma, platelets, and red blood cells), defined as damage control resuscitation, has been associated with improved outcomes; however, there have been no large multicenter clinical trials.

Objective: To determine the effectiveness and safety of transfusing patients with severe trauma and major bleeding using plasma, platelets, and red blood cells in a 1:1:1 ratio compared with a 1:1:2 ratio.

Design, setting, and participants: Pragmatic, phase 3, multisite, randomized clinical trial of 680 severely injured patients who arrived at 1 of 12 level I trauma centers in North America directly from the scene and were predicted to require massive transfusion between August 2012 and December 2013.

Interventions: Blood product ratios of 1:1:1 (338 patients) vs 1:1:2 (342 patients) during active resuscitation in addition to all local standard-of-care interventions (uncontrolled).

Main outcomes and measures: Primary outcomes were 24-hour and 30-day all-cause mortality. Prespecified ancillary outcomes included time to hemostasis, blood product volumes transfused, complications, incidence of surgical procedures, and functional status.

Results: No significant differences were detected in mortality at 24 hours (12.7% in 1:1:1 group vs 17.0% in 1:1:2 group; difference, -4.2% [95% CI, -9.6% to 1.1%]; P = .12) or at 30 days (22.4% vs 26.1%, respectively; difference, -3.7% [95% CI, -10.2% to 2.7%]; P = .26). Exsanguination, which was the predominant cause of death within the first 24 hours, was significantly decreased in the 1:1:1 group (9.2% vs 14.6% in 1:1:2 group; difference, -5.4% [95% CI, -10.4% to -0.5%]; P = .03). More patients in the 1:1:1 group achieved hemostasis than in the 1:1:2 group (86% vs 78%, respectively; P = .006). Despite the 1:1:1 group receiving more plasma (median of 7 U vs 5 U, P < .001) and platelets (12 U vs 6 U, P < .001) and similar amounts of red blood cells (9 U) over the first 24 hours, no differences between the 2 groups were found for the 23 prespecified complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure, venous thromboembolism, sepsis, and transfusion-related complications.

Conclusions and relevance: Among patients with severe trauma and major bleeding, early administration of plasma, platelets, and red blood cells in a 1:1:1 ratio compared with a 1:1:2 ratio did not result in significant differences in mortality at 24 hours or at 30 days. However, more patients in the 1:1:1 group achieved hemostasis and fewer experienced death due to exsanguination by 24 hours. Even though there was an increased use of plasma and platelets transfused in the 1:1:1 group, no other safety differences were identified between the 2 groups.",no_spin,6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.41376733779907227, 'probability': 0.6611547470092773}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -8.4638240878121e-06, 'probability': 0.9999915957450867}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.5775625109672546, 'probability': 0.5612647533416748}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -1.728519782773219e-05, 'probability': 0.9999827146530151}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.06938796490430832, 'probability': 0.9329646825790405}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -7.033323527139146e-06, 'probability': 0.9999929666519165}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.6850306987762451, 'probability': 0.50407475233078}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -6.079655122448457e-06, 'probability': 0.9999939203262329}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.565069854259491, 'probability': 0.5683205127716064}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -5.8412379075889476e-06, 'probability': 0.9999942183494568}]"

Delayed initiation of neuroprotective agents has hindered earlier phase 3 trials of neuroprotective agents.

Methods: We randomly assigned patients with suspected stroke to receive either intravenous magnesium sulfate or placebo, beginning within 2 hours after symptom onset. A loading dose was initiated by paramedics before the patient arrived at the hospital, and a 24-hour maintenance infusion was started on the patient's arrival at the hospital. The primary outcome was the degree of disability at 90 days, as measured by scores on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater disability).

Results: Among the 1700 enrolled patients (857 in the magnesium group and 843 in the placebo group), the mean (±SD) age was 69±13 years, 42.6% were women, and the mean pretreatment score on the Los Angeles Motor Scale of stroke severity (range, 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater motor deficits) was 3.7±1.3.

To increase the likelihood that good alignment will be achieved during surgery, smart tools such as robotics or patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) have been introduced.
Questions/purposes:В We hypothesized that UKA performed with PSI would result in improved level gait as ascertained with three-dimensional analysis, implant positioning, and patient-reported outcomes measured by a validated scoring system when compared with conventional instrumentation 3 months and 1 year after surgery.
Methods:В We randomized 60 patients into two groups using either the PSI technique or a conventional technique. All patients were operated on using the same technique and the same cemented metal-backed implant. Mean age of the patients was 63 В± 4 years (range, 54-72 years) and mean body mass index was 28 В± 3 kg/m(2). Patients were evaluated preoperatively, at 3 months, and 1 year after surgery by an independent observer blind to the type of technique. Gait parameters were assessed with three-dimensional analysis during level walking preoperatively and at 1 year, frontal and sagittal position of the implant was evaluated on full-length radiographs at 3 months, and subjective functional outcome and quality of life using routine questionnaires (SF-12, new Knee Society Score [KSS], Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) at 3 months and 1 year. This study had 80% power to detect a 15% difference in walking speed at the p < 0.05 level.
Results:В One year after surgery, there were no differences between the two groups in the analyzed gait spatiotemporal parameters, respectively, for PSI UKA and conventional UKA : double limb support 31% (25%-54%) versus 30% (23%-56%; p = 0.67) and walking speed (1.59 m/s [0.86-1.87 m/s] versus 1.57 m/s [0.71-1.96 m/s]; p = 0.41). No difference was observed between the two groups in terms of lower limb alignment (PSI group 178В° В± 3В°, conventional group 178В° В± 4В°; p = 0.24) or implant positioning on mediolateral and anteroposterior radiographs. There were no differences in the functional score between the PSI and conventional TKA groups at 3 months and 1 year after surgery: KSS objective knee scores (PSI: 85 В± 8 points at 3 months, 87 В± 5 points at 1 year and conventional instrumentation: 82 В± 8 points at 3 months 83 В± 6 points at 1 year; p = 0.10) and functional activity scores were similar in both group (PSI: 71 В± 12 points at 3 months and 74 В± 7 points at 1 year versus conventional group: 73 В± 11 points at 3 months and 75 В± 6 at 1 year; p = 0.9).

A Randomised Controlled Clinical Trial With 5-Year Follow-Up.,The Journal of Arthroplasty,,Claim benefit based on (+) secondary endpoint,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"New insert types have been developed to improve clinical and functional outcome in mobile bearing (MB-TKA) and fixed bearing total knee arthroplasty (FB-TKA). A prospective single blinded randomised controlled clinical trial was performed to evaluate 2 types of MB-TKA inserts and 2 types of FB-TKA inserts of the Genesis II prosthesis (Smith & Nephew) in 146 patients with 5-years follow-up. A significant difference (P=.042) between the MB-TKA inserts was found in KSS function scores, but clinical significance is expected to be limited. Goniometry, temporal gait parameters and QoL were similar in all groups. Survival was significantly better (P=.047) for FB-TKA.

option in the treatment of cuff tear arthropathy (CTA). Recent studies have 
described a positive effect of lateralization of the center of rotation, 
especially on postoperative rotational function. The goal of this study is to 
compare the outcome of non-lateralized versus lateralized RSA with particular 
regard to rotational function in patients with CTA.
METHODS: Thirty-four patients underwent implantation of RSA either with 
lateralization (nВ =В 17) or without lateralization (nВ =В 17) by use of a 1-cm 
autologous bone graft (""bony increased offset"") of the humeral head for CTA. 
Clinical outcomes were measured with the Constant score; the Disabilities of the 
Arm, Shoulder and Hand score; and the Activities of Daily Living 
RequiringВ External Rotation score, as well as measurement of external rotation 
and determination of the external rotation lag sign with the arm at the side and 
at 90В° of abduction, at 1 year postoperatively and at final follow-up. Computed 
tomography scan evaluation was performed in all patients preoperatively and at 1 
year postoperatively to assess preoperative fatty infiltration of the rotator 
cuff and bony integration of the graft postoperatively.
RESULTS: At final follow-up, all patients showed significantly increased 
functional results. There were no significant differences in the evaluated 
parameters. If patients with degenerative changes of the teres minor were 
excluded, the lateralized group showed significantly increased external 
rotation. Bony integration of the graft could be verified on postoperative 
computed tomography scans in all patients.
CONCLUSION: RSA with bony lateralization shows a trend toward improved external

Recent studies have described a positive effect of lateralization of the center of rotation, especially on postoperative rotational function. The goal of this study is to compare the outcome of non-lateralized versus lateralized RSA in patients with CTA.

METHODS: Thirty-four patients underwent implantation of RSA either with lateralization (n = 17) or without lateralization (n = 17) by use of a 1-cm autologous bone graft (""bony increased offset"") of the humeral head for CTA. Clinical outcomes were measured with the Constant score; the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score; and the Activities of Daily Living Requiring External Rotation score, as well as measurement of external rotation and determination of the external rotation lag sign with the arm at the side and at 90° of abduction, at 1 year postoperatively and at final follow-up. Computed tomography scan evaluation was performed in all patients preoperatively and at 1 year postoperatively to assess preoperative fatty infiltration of the rotator cuff and bony integration of the graft postoperatively.

RESULTS: At final follow-up, there were no significant differences in the evaluated parameters between the lateralized and non-lateralized groups. Bony integration of the graft could be verified on postoperative computed tomography scans in all patients.

CONCLUSION: Lateralized RSA was not more effective than non-lateralized RSA in patients with cuff tear arthropathy.",spin,2,2,"[{'token': 17, 'token_string': '2', 'logits': -0.40297433733940125, 'probability': 0.6683292388916016}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -3.4570634852570947e-06, 'probability': 0.999996542930603}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.9192178249359131, 'probability': 0.3988308608531952}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -1.3828182090946939e-05, 'probability': 0.9999861717224121}]",4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -1.3893615007400513, 'probability': 0.2492343932390213}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -4.0531076592742465e-06, 'probability': 0.9999960064888}]",2,2,"[{'token': 17, 'token_string': '2', 'logits': -0.11975952982902527, 'probability': 0.887133777141571}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -2.3841830625315197e-06, 'probability': 0.9999976754188538}]",2,2,"[{'token': 17, 'token_string': '2', 'logits': -0.5282771587371826, 'probability': 0.5896198749542236}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -2.9802276912960224e-06, 'probability': 0.9999970197677612}]"

reconstruction in young athletes is controversial. No long-term results have 
been published comparing tibialis posterior allografts to hamstring autografts.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term results of primary ACL reconstruction using 
either an allograft or autograft.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: From June 2002 to August 2003, patients with a symptomatic 
ACL-deficient knee were randomized to receive either a hamstring autograft or 
tibialis posterior allograft. All allografts were from a single tissue bank, 
aseptically processed, and fresh-frozen without terminal irradiation. Graft 
fixation was identical in all knees. All patients followed the same 
postoperative rehabilitation protocol, which was blinded to the therapists. 
Preoperative and postoperative assessments were performed via examination and/or 
telephone and Internet-based questionnaire to ascertain the functional and 
subjective status using established knee metrics. The primary outcome measures 
were graft integrity, subjective knee stability, and functional status.
RESULTS: There were 99 patients (100 knees); 86 were men, and 95% were 
active-duty military. Both groups were similar in demographics and preoperative 
activity level. The mean and median ages of both groups were identical at 29 and 
26 years, respectively. Concomitant meniscal and chondral pathologic 
abnormalities, microfracture, and meniscal repair performed at the time of 
reconstruction were similar in both groups. At a minimum of 10 years (range, 
120-132 months) from surgery, 96 patients (97 knees) were contacted (2 patients 
were deceased, and 1 was unable to be located). There were 4 (8.3%) autograft 
and 13 (26.5%) allograft failures that required revision reconstruction. In the 
remaining patients whose graft was intact, there was no difference in the mean 
Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation, Tegner, or International Knee

reconstruction in young athletes is controversial. No long-term results have 
been published comparing tibialis posterior allografts to hamstring autografts.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term results of primary ACL reconstruction using 
either an allograft or autograft.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: From June 2002 to August 2003, patients with a symptomatic 
ACL-deficient knee were randomized to receive either a hamstring autograft or 
tibialis posterior allograft. All allografts were from a single tissue bank, 
aseptically processed, and fresh-frozen without terminal irradiation. Graft 
fixation was identical in all knees. All patients followed the same 
postoperative rehabilitation protocol, which was blinded to the therapists. 
Preoperative and postoperative assessments were performed via examination and/or 
telephone and Internet-based questionnaire to ascertain the functional and 
subjective status using established knee metrics. The primary outcome measures 
were graft integrity, subjective knee stability, and functional status.
RESULTS: There were 99 patients (100 knees); 86 were men, and 95% were 
active-duty military. Both groups were similar in demographics and preoperative 
activity level. The mean and median ages of both groups were identical at 29 and 
26 years, respectively. Concomitant meniscal and chondral pathologic 
abnormalities, microfracture, and meniscal repair performed at the time of 
reconstruction were similar in both groups. At a minimum of 10 years (range, 
120-132 months) from surgery, 96 patients (97 knees) were contacted (2 patients 
were deceased, and 1 was unable to be located). There were 4 (8.3%) autograft 
and 13 (26.5%) allograft failures that required revision reconstruction. In the 
remaining patients whose graft was intact, there was no difference in the mean 
Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation, Tegner, or International Knee 
Documentation Committee scores.
CONCLUSION: At a minimum of 10 years after ACL reconstruction in a young 
athletic population, over 80% of all grafts were intact and had maintained 
stability. However, those patients who had an allograft failed at a rate over 3 
times higher than those with an autograft.",no_spin,8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.5829561352729797, 'probability': 0.5582456588745117}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -2.396077979938127e-05, 'probability': 0.9999760389328003}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.5810005068778992, 'probability': 0.5593385100364685}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -1.3232143828645349e-05, 'probability': 0.9999868273735046}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.39831116795539856, 'probability': 0.671453058719635}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -6.9141146923357155e-06, 'probability': 0.999993085861206}]","This abstract is not about cancer, it's about ACL reconstruction.

of intra-articular hip disorders. While most arthroscopic hip procedures are 
performed as outpatient surgeries, patients can still experience significant 
postoperative pain and opioid-associated side effects.
PURPOSE: The potential benefits of a preoperative femoral nerve block (FNB) in 
hip arthroscopy were explored in a previous retrospective review. The study 
objective was to confirm these findings in a prospective randomized study.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: Fifty patients undergoing hip arthroscopy were included in this 
prospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial that was patient-, 
operator-, and assessor-blinded. Patients received either a preoperative 
ultrasound-guided FNB with 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine (FNB group) or normal 
saline (control group). Nerve blockade was confirmed via standardized sensory 
testing before the induction of general anesthesia. The primary endpoint was 
cumulative consumption of oral morphine equivalent at 24 hours after discharge. 
Secondary endpoints included opioid use at various time points, pain scores, 
Quality of Recovery (QoR-27) score, incidence of nausea and vomiting, time to 
discharge, block-related complications, falls at 24 hours, and patient 
satisfaction.
RESULTS: Fifty patients completed the study, including 27 in the FNB group and 
23 in the control group. Most patient characteristics were statistically similar 
between groups except for operative time, which was longer in the control group. 
Cumulative oral morphine consumption was lower in the FNB group at 48 hours; 
there was no difference at 24 hours or 7 days postoperatively. Pain scores were 
significantly lower up to 6 hours postoperatively in the FNB group compared with 
control; however, rebound pain was observed at 24 hours after discharge in 
patients who received FNB. There was no difference in most secondary outcomes. 
Importantly, a total of 6 patients in the FNB group reported falls (without 
injury) within the first 24 hours postoperatively compared with none in the 
control group. Patient satisfaction with pain control was high in both groups at 
all time points.

However, there are few well-designed studies comparing approaches to treatment.

Questions/purposes: (1) Which treatment (compression bandaging with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], aspiration, or aspiration with steroid injections) is associated with the highest likelihood of resolution of nonseptic olecranon bursitis? (2) Which treatment is associated with earliest resolution of symptoms? (3) What factors are associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks?

Methods: We enrolled 133 patients from two centers; after applying prespecified exclusions (septic bursitis or concomitant inflammatory arthritis, intraarticular elbow pathology, recent aspiration or steroid injection done elsewhere, and refusal to participate), 90 patients were randomly allocated to receive compression bandaging with NSAIDs (C), aspiration (A), or aspiration with steroid injection (AS) groups (30 patients in each). The groups were similar at baseline in terms of age and gender. Seven patients (four from Group A and three from Group AS) were lost to followup. All patients were followed up weekly for 4 weeks, and the same treatment procedure was repeated if the bursitis recurred with any substantial fluid collection. At 4 weeks, the state of resolution and pain visual analog scale (VAS) were evaluated. Failed resolution was defined as presence of persistent olecranon bursal fluid collection at Week 4 after the initiation of the treatment; on the contrary, if bursal fluid collection was clinically reduced or completely disappeared by the end of Week 4, the treatment was considered successful. We compared the proportion of resolution by Week 4 and the median times to resolution among the treatment groups. In addition, we evaluated whether the resolution affected pain VAS and what factors were associated with the resolution.

Results: There were no differences in the proportion of patients whose bursitis resolved by Week 4 among the three treatment groups (Group C: 25 of 30 [83%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.27-1.72], p = 0.580; Group A: 17 of 26 [65%], relative risk of resolution failure: 2.19 [95% CI, 0.98-4.87], p = 0.083; Group AS: 23 of 27 [85%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.59 [95% CI, 0.22-1.63], p = 0.398) (p = 0.073). Steroid injection after aspiration (Group AS) was associated with the earliest resolution (2.3 weeks [range, 1-4 weeks]) when compared with aspiration alone (Group A; 3.1 weeks [range, 2-4 weeks]) and compression bandaging with NSAIDs (Group C; 3.2 weeks [range, 2-4 weeks]), p = 0.015). Longer duration of symptoms before treatment was the only factor associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks (failed resolution: 6 weeks [range, 2-9 weeks]; successful resolution: 4 weeks [range, 0.4-6 weeks]; p = 0.008).

Conclusions: With the numbers available, there were no differences in efficacy when compression bandaging with NSAIDs, aspiration, and aspiration with steroid injection were compared. However, we were powered only to detect a 30% difference, meaning that if there were a smaller difference in efficacy among the groups, we might not have detected it in a study of this size. Our data can be used as pilot data to power future prospective (and likely multicenter) trials. Because olecranon bursitis can recur, and because treatments like aspiration and aspiration with steroid injection can cause complications, unless future trials demonstrate clear efficacy advantages of aspiration and/or injection both at short and longer terms, we suggest that compression bandaging and a short course of NSAIDs may offer the most appropriate balance of safety and efficacy.",no_spin,6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.8907148838043213, 'probability': 0.4103623032569885}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -8.583032467868179e-06, 'probability': 0.9999913573265076}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.026363378390669823, 'probability': 0.9739810824394226}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -2.0146166207268834e-05, 'probability': 0.9999799132347107}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.27945229411125183, 'probability': 0.7561978101730347}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -1.168244216387393e-05, 'probability': 0.999988317489624}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.564731240272522, 'probability': 0.5685129165649414}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -6.198863957251888e-06, 'probability': 0.9999938607215881}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.05922173708677292, 'probability': 0.9424977898597717}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -5.960446742392378e-06, 'probability': 0.9999939799308777}]"

However, there are few well-designed studies comparing approaches to treatment.

Questions/purposes: (1) Which treatment (compression bandaging with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], aspiration, or aspiration with steroid injections) is associated with the highest likelihood of resolution of nonseptic olecranon bursitis? (2) Which treatment is associated with earliest resolution of symptoms? (3) What factors are associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks?

Methods: We enrolled 133 patients from two centers; after applying prespecified exclusions (septic bursitis or concomitant inflammatory arthritis, intraarticular elbow pathology, recent aspiration or steroid injection done elsewhere, and refusal to participate), 90 patients were randomly allocated to receive compression bandaging with NSAIDs (C), aspiration (A), or aspiration with steroid injection (AS) groups (30 patients in each). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients whose bursitis resolved by Week 4. Secondary outcomes included time to resolution, pain visual analog scale (VAS), and factors associated with treatment failure. The groups were similar at baseline in terms of age and gender. Seven patients (four from Group A and three from Group AS) were lost to followup. All patients were followed up weekly for 4 weeks, and the same treatment procedure was repeated if the bursitis recurred with any substantial fluid collection. At 4 weeks, the state of resolution and pain visual analog scale (VAS) were evaluated. Failed resolution was defined as presence of persistent olecranon bursal fluid collection at Week 4 after the initiation of the treatment; on the contrary, if bursal fluid collection was clinically reduced or completely disappeared by the end of Week 4, the treatment was considered successful. We compared the proportion of resolution by Week 4 and the median times to resolution among the treatment groups.

Our hypothesis was that there would be no differences in joint line angles or correction accuracy between the two groups, that patellar height would increase after CW HTO and decrease after OW HTO, and that leg length and posterior tibial slope would decrease after CW HTO and increase after OW HTO.

Methods: Radiological data were collected from 70 patients participating in an ongoing prospective randomized clinical trial comparing OW and CW HTOs. Digital standing hip-knee-ankle (HKA) radiographs as well as lateral radiographs in 30Ў of flexion were obtained preoperatively and at 6 months for each patient. Joint line angles, HKA angle, leg length, Insall-Salvati index, Miura-Kawamura index and posterior tibial slope were measured using medical planning software. The complete preoperative radiological examinations of the first 50 patients were used in a study of intra- and inter-rater reliability of the measurements.

Results: The mean posterior slope was reduced by 2.5Ў in CW HTO, whereas it remained unchanged in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Mean leg length decreased 5.7 mm in CW HTO and increased 3.1 mm in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Changes in joint line angles, patellar height indexes and the correction accuracy showed no significant differences comparing the two techniques. Frontal plane reliability measurement intra- and inter-rater intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) varied from 0.81 to 0.99. Sagittal plane intra- and inter-rater ICC varied from 0.60 to 0.87. Posterior tibial slope intra- and inter-rater ICC showed the lowest values (0.70 and 0.60, respectively) corresponding to a smallest real difference of 4.5Ў and 5.5Ў, respectively.

Conclusions: Posterior tibial slope and leg length changes were significantly different in CW compared to OW HTOs.

The present study aimed to compare efficacy of combined IV and topical TXA with IV use alone in terms of blood loss, transfusion rate, and incidence of deep vein thrombosis and thromboembolism.
Patients and methods:В 119 patients undergoing unilateral TKA were randomized into IV alone and combined group. Patients assigned to IV group were given IV TXA as a preoperative and postoperative dose given 3 and 6 hours after surgery, whereas in combined group, topical TXA solution was applied intraarticularly about 5 minutes before closure of arthrotomy in addition to IV doses.
Results:В Combined use of IV and topical TXA provided better results than IV use alone with mean calculated total blood loss (590.69В±191.1 vs 385.68В±182.5, P<.001), blood transfusion rate (6.6% vs 1.6%, P = .364), hemoglobin drop (1.82В±0.6 vs 1.14В±0.5, P<.001). No case of DVT or TE was noted among the 2 study groups.
Conclusion:В Combined use of IV and intraarticular TXA provided significantly better results compared with IV use alone with respect to all variables related to postoperative blood loss in TKA.

Objective: To test the hypothesis that high-intensity endurance training (ET) is superior to moderate-intensity ET for improving risk factors for type 2 diabetes in overweight adolescents.

Design and methods: In this randomized trial, 106 overweight and obese adolescents (15.2 years; 76% female; 62% Caucasian) were randomly assigned to high-intensity ET (70-85% of heart rate reserve, n=38), moderate-intensity ET (40-55% heart rate reserve; n=32) or control for 6 months (n=36). The primary and secondary outcome measures were insulin sensitivity assessed using a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test and hepatic triglyceride content with magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Exploratory outcomes were cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity and MRI and dual x-ray absorptiometry-derived measures of adiposity.

Results: The study had 96% retention and attendance was 61±21% and 55±24% in the high- and moderate-intensity ET arms.

reliable operation in terms of pain relief and return of function. However, 
during the needling process, a cuff defect is created. Little is known about the 
evolution of this defect.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial to 
investigate the evolution of the aforementioned defect and the role of 
platelet-rich plasma (PRP) augmentation in this healing process. Patients were 
randomized to either group 1 (PRP, nвЂ‰=вЂ‰20) or group 2 (no PRP [control group], 
nвЂ‰=вЂ‰20). Patients in group 1 received a perioperative PRP infiltration at the 
rotator cuff defect, whereas the control group did not. Patients were assessed 
clinically preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and 1 
year. The Constant score, Simple Shoulder Test, and QuickDASH (short version of 
Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire) were used as outcome 
measures. The evolution of the cuff defect was evaluated on sonography at 3 and 
6 months and with magnetic resonance imaging after 1 year.
RESULTS: All patients improved significantly after surgery (PвЂ‰<вЂ‰.05). There was 
no difference in clinical outcome or rotator cuff healing between groups. We 
observed a high rate of persistent rotator cuff defects after 1 year in both 
groups. The presence of residual cuff defects did not influence the clinical 
outcome.
CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic needling is an operation with a predictive, good

reliable operation in terms of pain relief and return of function. However, 
during the needling process, a cuff defect is created. Little is known about the 
evolution of this defect.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial to 
investigate the evolution of the aforementioned defect and the role of 
platelet-rich plasma (PRP) augmentation in this healing process. The primary 
outcome was rotator cuff healing. Patients were randomized to either group 1 
(PRP, n = 20) or group 2 (no PRP [control group], n = 20). Patients in group 1 
received a perioperative PRP infiltration at the rotator cuff defect, whereas 
the control group did not. Patients were assessed clinically preoperatively and 
postoperatively at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and 1 year. The Constant score, 
Simple Shoulder Test, and QuickDASH (short version of Disabilities of the Arm, 
Shoulder and Hand questionnaire) were used as secondary outcome measures. The 
evolution of the cuff defect was evaluated on sonography at 3 and 6 months and 
with magnetic resonance imaging after 1 year.
RESULTS: There was no difference in rotator cuff healing between groups. We 
observed a high rate of persistent rotator cuff defects after 1 year in both 
groups. There was no difference in clinical outcome between groups. The presence 
of residual cuff defects did not influence the clinical outcome.

Methods: Participants (n = 53) completed a randomized dietary intervention and consumed either a LF diet (25% fat) or PC diet (33% fat) for 6 weeks. Fat taste thresholds (lowest detectable fat concentration), fat perception (discrimination ability), preference, and anthropometry were assessed at baseline and week 6.

Results: Consumption of a LF diet (n = 26) and PC diet (n = 27) reduced participants' weight (P < 0.001), with no significant differences between groups (LF, -2.9%, PC, -2.7%). Both diets resulted in a decrease in fat taste thresholds (P = 0.014), and the effect tended to be stronger in the LF diet vs. the PC diet (P = 0.060).

This study assessed the effect of a 6-week low-fat (LF) or portion control (PC) diet matched for weight loss on fat taste thresholds, fat perception, and preference in people with overweight/obesity.

Methods: Participants (n = 53) completed a randomized dietary intervention and consumed either a LF diet (25% fat) or PC diet (33% fat) for 6 weeks. Fat taste thresholds (lowest detectable fat concentration), fat perception (discrimination ability), preference, and anthropometry were assessed at baseline and week 6.

Results: Consumption of a LF diet (n = 26) and PC diet (n = 27) reduced participants' weight (P < 0.001), with no significant differences between groups (LF, -2.9%, PC, -2.7%). Both diets resulted in a decrease in fat taste thresholds (P = 0.014), with no significant difference between the LF diet and PC diet (P = 0.060). The ability to perceive different fat concentrations in foods was increased after the LF diet only (P = 0.017); however, food preference did not change on either diet.

It delays mobilization, increases opioid consumption and side effects, and lengthens hospitalization. This challenge multiplies when treating an opioid-dependent population. We examined whether a novel suspended release local anesthetic, liposomal bupivacaine (LB) would improve pain control and decrease opioid consumption after TKA compared to a standard periarticular injection in opioid-dependent patients.

Methods: Thirty-eight patients undergoing TKA were randomly assigned to receive either a periarticular injection (PAI) with LB (n = 20) or with a standard PAI (including a combination of ropivacaine, clonidine, Toradol, Epinepherine, and saline; n = 18) as part of a multimodal pain management approach. All periarticular injections were done by a single surgeon. Perioperative treatment was similar between groups. Postoperative information regarding pain level was evaluated by a pain visual analog scale score. Postoperative opioid consumption was recorded.

Results: After controlling baseline narcotic usage before surgery, no differences were found between groups in daily postoperative narcotic usage (P = .113), average daily pain score (P = .332), or maximum daily pain score (P = .881). However, when examining pain levels separately for each day, pain visual analog scale scores were reported higher in post operative day 1 in the LB group (P = .033).

functional scores (P > .05). The mean follow-up period was 25.9 В± 1.2 months. 
Significant improvements in functional and pain scores were observed in both 
groups at the last follow-up visit. However, no significant differences in 
functional scores and ROM were found between the 2 groups at each time point, 
except that group 2 had significantly lower VAS pain scores (P < .05) at 3, 6, 
and 12 months postoperatively. Eight (17%) of 48 patients in group 1 and 6 (18%) 
of 34 patients in group 2 showed retears on MRI at 12-month follow-up (P > .05).

double-row repair were effective in improving clinical outcomes in the treatment 
of delaminated rotator cuff tears. Lower pain scores were seen in patients who

METHODS: One hundred twenty patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff 
repair with SLBC lesions (biceps partial tears <50%, partial pulley lesions, and 
type II SLAP lesions) were enrolled in this prospective comparative study and 
randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups (simple debridement [Deb], biceps 
tenotomy only [BTo], or biceps tenodesis with one suture anchor [BTd]). Patients 
with isolated subscapularis tears or osteoarthritis were excluded. Finally, 86 
patients (Deb in 28, BTo in 27, and BTd in 31) were analyzed (mean follow-up, 
22.1 ± 7.72 months; mean age, 58.98 ± 7.8 years). Pain; functional, clinical,

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination of intravenous (IV) and topical tranexamic acid (TXA) in revision THA.

Methods: Eighty-four consecutive patients undergoing revision THA were randomized into combined group and IV-TXA group. Patients in the combined group were given intravenously 15 mg/kg TXA as a preoperative, and topical TXA solution was applied at a concentration of 3 g TXA per 100-mL saline during the different procedure points. Patients in the IV-TXA group were given intravenously 15 mg/kg TXA alone.

Results: The mean total blood loss, drainage volume, and maximum hemoglobin drop were significantly lower in the combined group than the IV-TXA group (P < .001, P < .001, P < .001, respectively). Compared with the IV-TXA group, the amount of blood transfusions and number of blood transfusions required were decreased dramatically in the combined group (P = .027, P < .001, respectively).

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination of intravenous (IV) and topical tranexamic acid (TXA) in revision THA.

Methods: Eighty-four consecutive patients undergoing revision THA were randomized into combined group and IV-TXA group. The primary outcome was total blood loss. Patients in the combined group were given intravenously 15 mg/kg TXA as a preoperative, and topical TXA solution was applied at a concentration of 3 g TXA per 100-mL saline during the different procedure points. Patients in the IV-TXA group were given intravenously 15 mg/kg TXA alone.

Results: The mean total blood loss was 1,247 mL in the combined group and 1,689 mL in the IV-TXA group (P < .001). The drainage volume and maximum hemoglobin drop were lower in the combined group than the IV-TXA group (P < .001, P < .001, respectively). The amount of blood transfusions and number of blood transfusions required were lower in the combined group compared with the IV-TXA group (P = .027, P < .001, respectively).

established as a standard treatment for large full-thickness cartilage defects, 
the effect of different doses of autologous chondrocyte products on structural 
outcomes has never been examined.
HYPOTHESIS: In ACI, the dose level may have an influence on medium-term magnetic 
resonance morphological findings after treatment.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: A total of 75 patients who underwent ACI using a pure, autologous, 
third-generation matrix-associated ACI product were divided into 3 groups 
representing different doses: 3 to 7 spheroids/cm(2), 10 to 30 spheroids/cm(2), 
and 40 to 70 spheroids/cm(2). Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 1.5, 
3, 6, and 12 months after ACI and was evaluated by the magnetic resonance 
observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score and the Knee injury and 
Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS).
RESULTS: MOCART scores showed improvements after 3 months, with slight dose 
dependence, and further improvement after 12 months, although without 
significant dose dependence. The mean MOCART scores after 3 months (0 = worst, 
100 = best) were 59.8, 64.5, and 64.7 for the low-, medium-, and high-dose 
groups, respectively, and 62.9 for all patients; at 12 months, these were 74.1, 
74.5, and 68.8 for the respective dose groups and 72.4 for all patients. Several 
MOCART items (surface of repair tissue, structure of repair tissue, signal 
intensity of repair tissue, subchondral bone, and synovitis) showed a more rapid 
response with the medium and high doses than with the low dose, suggesting a 
potential dose relationship. No significant correlation between the MOCART 
(overall and subscores) with clinical outcomes as assessed by the overall KOOS 
was detected at 3- and 12-month assessments.
CONCLUSION: This study reveals a trend toward earlier recovery after treatment 
with higher spheroid doses in terms of better defect filling for full-thickness 
cartilage defects of the knee, while outcomes after 12 months were similar in 
all dose groups. However, a correlation with clinical outcomes or the failure 
rate at 1 year after ACI was not found. A longer follow-up will be required for 
more definite conclusions on the clinical relevance of ACI cell density to be 
drawn.

patients is under debate.
PURPOSE: To compare clinical outcomes and calf muscle strength recovery after 
the nonsurgical treatment and open surgical repair of acute Achilles tendon 
ruptures with identical accelerated rehabilitation programs.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: From 2009 to 2013, a total of 60 patients with an acute Achilles tendon 
rupture were randomized to surgery or nonsurgical treatment. Nonsurgical 
treatment included first a week of cast immobilization, followed by a functional 
orthosis for 6 weeks, allowing full weightbearing after week 1 and active 
plantar flexion after week 5. Surgery was simple end-to-end open repair, and 
postoperative treatment was identical to nonsurgical treatment. The primary outcome 
was the Leppilahti Achilles tendon performance score. Secondary outcomes included 
isokinetic calf muscle strength and RAND 36-Item Health Survey at 18-month follow-up.
RESULTS: At 18-month follow-up, the mean Leppilahti score was 79.5 and 75.7 for 
the surgically and nonsurgically treated groups, respectively (mean difference, 
3.8; 95% CI, -1.9 to 9.5; P = .19). Angle-specific peak torque results of 
affected legs at 18 months showed a 14% difference in the peak torque of the 
affected leg favoring the surgical group versus the nonsurgical group (mean peak 
torque, 110.3 vs 96.5 N·m, respectively; mean difference, 13.6 N·m; 95% CI, 
2.0-25.1 N·m; P = .022). The RAND 36-Item Health Survey indicated differences 
in the domains of physical functioning (P = .006) and bodily pain (P = .037) 
for surgically treated patients.
CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment was not more effective than nonsurgical treatment

142,27307495,A Prospective Randomized Trial Comparing Surgical and Nonsurgical Treatments of Acute Achilles Tendon Ruptures.,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,,"""Trend toward significance"" // ""Numerically longer survival"" or equivalent verbiage",Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment of acute Achilles tendon ruptures for active 
patients is under debate.
PURPOSE: To compare clinical outcomes and calf muscle strength recovery after 
the nonsurgical treatment and open surgical repair of acute Achilles tendon 
ruptures with identical accelerated rehabilitation programs.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: From 2009 to 2013, a total of 60 patients with an acute Achilles tendon 
rupture were randomized to surgery or nonsurgical treatment. Nonsurgical 
treatment included first a week of cast immobilization, followed by a functional 
orthosis for 6 weeks, allowing full weightbearing after week 1 and active 
plantar flexion after week 5. Surgery was simple end-to-end open repair, and 
postoperative treatment was identical to nonsurgical treatment. Outcome measures 
included the Leppilahti Achilles tendon performance score, isokinetic calf 
muscle strength, and RAND 36-Item Health Survey at 18-month follow-up.
RESULTS: At 18-month follow-up, the mean Leppilahti score was 79.5 and 75.7 for 
the surgically and nonsurgically treated groups, respectively (mean difference, 
3.8; 95% CI, -1.9 to 9.5; P = .19). Angle-specific peak torque results of 
affected legs showed that surgery resulted in faster and better recovery of calf 
muscle strength over the entire range of motion of the ankle joint: at 6 months, 
the difference varied from 16% to 24% (P = .016), favoring the surgically 
treated group, whereas at 18 months, surgically treated patients had 10% to 18% 
greater strength results (P = .037). At 18 months, a 14% difference in the peak 
torque of the affected leg favored the surgical group versus the nonsurgical 
group (mean peak torque, 110.3 vs 96.5 NВ·m, respectively; mean difference, 13.6 
NВ·m; 95% CI, 2.0-25.1 NВ·m; P = .022). The RAND 36-Item Health Survey indicated 
better results in the domains of physical functioning (P = .006) and bodily pain 
(P = .037) for surgically treated patients.
CONCLUSION: Surgical and nonsurgical treatments of acute Achilles tendon 
ruptures have similar results in terms of the Achilles tendon performance score, 
but surgery restores calf muscle strength earlier over the entire range of 
motion of the ankle joint, with a 10% to 18% strength difference favoring 
surgery at 18 months. Surgery may also result in better health-related quality 
of life in the domains of physical functioning and bodily pain compared with 
nonsurgical treatment.

METHODS: Patients with OHCA between May 2006 and January 2014 with shockable 
initial rhythm, treated by first responders, were randomized to two automated 
external defibrillator (AED) treatment protocols. In the control protocol AEDs 
performed post-shock analysis and prompted rescuers to a pulse check (Guidelines

There is still a need for a method of anesthesia that can deliver effective long-term postoperative pain relief without incurring the high cost and health burden of opioids and nerve blocks.

Questions/purposes: (1) Is liposomal bupivacaine-based periarticular injection (PAI) more effective than morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA? (2) Do patients treated with liposomal bupivacaine-based PAI experience fewer opioid-related adverse events compared with patients treated with morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA?

Methods: This multicenter, blind trial randomized 119 patients undergoing TKA with spinal anesthesia to receive spinal anesthesia plus periarticular injection with liposomal bupivacaine (40 patients), spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine plus intrathecal morphine (41 patients) but no liposomal bupivacaine injection, or spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine (38 patients) and no liposomal bupivacaine injection. The two groups that did not receive periarticular liposomal bupivacaine did receive periarticular injection with ropivacaine, and all three groups had ketorolac (30 mg) plus epinephrine (1:1000) in the periarticular injections. Patients in all three groups received identical perioperative multimodal analgesic and antiemetic drugs. All patients were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized and no patients were lost to followup. The primary study endpoints were visual analog score (VAS) for pain and narcotic use during postoperative day 1. Secondary endpoints included side effects associated with narcotic administration during the hospital stay.

Results: Mean VAS pain in the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group was lower than that for the ropivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (1.8 ± 2.1 versus 3.3 ± 2.3, p = 0.005, mean difference: 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-2.5) and 12 hours (1.5 ± 2.0 versus 3.3 ± 2.4, p < 0.001, mean difference: 1.8, 95% CI, 0.8-2.8) after surgery. The morphine spinal group had lower pain compared with the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (0.9 ± 1.8 versus 1.8 ± 2.1, p = 0.035, mean difference: 1.0, 95% CI, 0.1-1.8), but there was no difference at 12 hours (0.8 ± 1.5 versus 1.5 ± 2.0, p = 0.086, mean difference: 0.7, 95% CI, -0.1 to 1.5). The magnitude of the differences at 6 and 12 hours are near the lower end of minimal clinically important differences reported in the literature, and thus the improvement shown in this study may only represent a small clinical improvement.

Conclusions: This prospective multicenter three-arm blind randomized controlled trial showed potentially improved pain control at 6 and 12 hours in the liposomal bupivacaine and intrathecal morphine groups compared with the ropivacaine group at the cost of much higher incidences of pruritus (itching) in the intrathecal morphine group. Based on these results, we prefer the use of PAI with liposomal bupivacaine as an alternative to spinal anesthesia with intrathecal morphine as a result of similar postoperative pain control and the potential for reducing adverse events.",no_spin,8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.5240309834480286, 'probability': 0.5921288728713989}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -7.986990567587782e-06, 'probability': 0.9999920725822449}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.06284096837043762, 'probability': 0.9390928149223328}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -1.9192511899746023e-05, 'probability': 0.9999808073043823}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.6103271245956421, 'probability': 0.5431731939315796}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -7.986990567587782e-06, 'probability': 0.9999920725822449}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.6870757341384888, 'probability': 0.5030450224876404}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -6.794906312279636e-06, 'probability': 0.9999931454658508}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.7955045104026794, 'probability': 0.45135343074798584}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -6.318072337307967e-06, 'probability': 0.999993622303009}]"

rare.
PURPOSE: To compare the clinical outcomes of arthroscopic anatomic DB ACLR with 
a hamstring tendon autograft versus irradiated allograft.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: Between 2008 and 2009, a total of 107 patients undergoing arthroscopic 
DB ACLR were prospectively randomized consecutively into 1 of 2 groups 
(autograft [Auto] group and irradiated allograft [Ir-Allo] group). All the 
surgical procedures were performed by the same senior surgeon using the DB 
reconstruction technique. All irradiated hamstring tendon allografts were 
sterilized with 2.5 Mrad of irradiation before distribution and were obtained 
from a single certified tissue bank. Graft fixation on the femoral side was by 
an Endobutton, and on the tibial side by a bioabsorbable interference screw 
augmented with a staple. The same rehabilitation protocol was applied to all 
patients. Before surgery and at a mean of 6.9 years of follow-up, patients were 
evaluated by the same observer according to objective and subjective clinical 
evaluations including detailed history, physical examination, radiography, 
functional knee ligament testing, KT-2000 arthrometer testing, Harner vertical

233,27604584,Navigation is Equal to Estimation by Eye and Palpation in Preventing Psoas Impingement in THA.,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,  Focus on (+) subgroup analysis,Claim benefit based on (+) subgroup analysis,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Iliopsoas tendon impingement is one possible reason for persistent 
groin pain and diminished functional outcome after THA. So far, estimation by 
eye and palpation is the standard procedure to intraoperatively assess the 
distance of the cup to the anterior rim. However, novel technologies such as 
imageless navigation enable intraoperative measurements of the cup in relation 
to the psoas tendon and bony landmarks.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether psoas impingement can be reduced using 
imageless navigation compared with the standard technique.
METHODS: The current study is a reanalysis of data from a randomized controlled 
trial evaluating navigation for THA; 135 patients were randomized for surgery 
with or without the use of imageless navigation. The primary outcome was the 
risk for anterior protrusion of the cup above the acetabular rim and thus 
potential psoas impingement, defined as an overhang of the cup above the 
anterior acetabular rim as measured on postoperative CT, which was either 
controlled with the help of navigation or standard control by eye and palpation 
intraoperatively. Postoperatively, the anterior protrusion of the cup above the 
acetabular rim was measured on three-dimensional (3-D) CT by a blinded, external 
institute. In addition to patient-related outcome measures, the Harris hip 
score, Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and EuroQol were 
obtained 1 year postoperatively. Altogether 123 data sets were available for 
primary analysis and 115 were available for 1-year followup.
RESULTS: There was no difference, with the numbers available, between the 
navigated and the control groups in terms of the mean distance of the cup below 
the anterosuperior acetabular rim (3.9 mm; -5.3 to 12.6 mm versus 4.4 mm; -7.9 
to 13.7 mm; p = 0.72) or the anteroinferior acetabular rim (4.7 mm; -6.2 to 14.8 
mm versus 4.2 mm; -7.1 to 16.3 mm; p = 0.29). There was no difference, with the 
numbers available, in terms of the proportion of cups with anterior overhang 
(7%, four of 57 versus, 15%, 10 of 66; p = 0.16), respectively. After 
controlling for potential confounding variables such as cup inclination, cup 
size, patient age, BMI, stage of arthritis, and length of skin incision, we 
found cup anteversion (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% CI, 0.81-0.93; p < 0.001) 
and female sex (HR, 3.88; 95% CI, 1.01-14.93; p = 0.049) were associated with a 
propensity to potential psoas impingement. With the numbers available, there 
were no differences observed in clinical scores between groups with and without 
anterior cup protrusion.

232,27604584,Navigation is Equal to Estimation by Eye and Palpation in Preventing Psoas Impingement in THA.,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,  Focus on (+) subgroup analysis,Claim benefit based on (+) subgroup analysis,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Iliopsoas tendon impingement is one possible reason for persistent 
groin pain and diminished functional outcome after THA. So far, estimation by 
eye and palpation is the standard procedure to intraoperatively assess the 
distance of the cup to the anterior rim. However, novel technologies such as 
imageless navigation enable intraoperative measurements of the cup in relation 
to the psoas tendon and bony landmarks.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether psoas impingement (1) can be reduced using 
imageless navigation compared with the standard technique and (2) is associated 
with specific patient characteristics. Furthermore, we investigated (3) if 
anterior cup protrusion (overhang) is associated with lower outcome scores for 
pain and function.
METHODS: The current study is a reanalysis of data from a randomized controlled 
trial evaluating navigation for THA; 135 patients were randomized for surgery 
with or without the use of imageless navigation. The risk for anterior 
protrusion of the cup above the acetabular rim and thus potential psoas 
impingement, defined as an overhang of the cup above the anterior acetabular rim 
as measured on postoperative CT, was either controlled with the help of 
navigation or standard control by eye and palpation intraoperatively. 
Postoperatively, the anterior protrusion of the cup above the acetabular rim was 
measured on three-dimensional (3-D) CT by a blinded, external institute. In 
addition to patient-related outcome measures, the Harris hip score, Hip 
disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and EuroQol were obtained 1 year 
postoperatively. Altogether 123 data sets were available for primary analysis 
and 115 were available for 1-year followup.
RESULTS: There was no difference, with the numbers available, between the 
navigated and the control groups in terms of the mean distance of the cup below 
the anterosuperior acetabular rim (3.9 mm; -5.3 to 12.6 mm versus 4.4 mm; -7.9 
to 13.7 mm; p = 0.72) or the anteroinferior acetabular rim (4.7 mm; -6.2 to 14.8 
mm versus 4.2 mm; -7.1 to 16.3 mm; p = 0.29). There was no difference, with the 
numbers available, in terms of the proportion of cups with anterior overhang 
(7%, four of 57 versus, 15%, 10 of 66; p = 0.16), respectively. After 
controlling for potential confounding variables such as cup inclination, cup 
size, patient age, BMI, stage of arthritis, and length of skin incision, we 
found cup anteversion (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% CI, 0.81-0.93; p < 0.001) 
and female sex (HR, 3.88; 95% CI, 1.01-14.93; p = 0.049) were associated with a 
propensity to potential psoas impingement. With the numbers available, there 
were no differences observed in clinical scores between groups with and without 
anterior cup protrusion.
CONCLUSIONS: We found no differences between imageless navigation and estimation 
by eye and palpation in preventing potential psoas impingement. Despite the 
comparable clinical outcome for patients with and without cup protrusion, the 
orthopaedic surgeon should be especially aware of propensity for psoas 
impingement in women.",no_spin,2,2,"[{'token': 17, 'token_string': '2', 'logits': -0.32271796464920044, 'probability': 0.7241780161857605}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -5.602820692729438e-06, 'probability': 0.9999943971633911}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.021281462162733078, 'probability': 0.9789433479309082}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -2.0265373677830212e-05, 'probability': 0.9999796748161316}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.11849147081375122, 'probability': 0.8882593512535095}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -7.271740287251305e-06, 'probability': 0.9999926686286926}]",4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.758325457572937, 'probability': 0.4684502184391022}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -3.6954811548639555e-06, 'probability': 0.9999962449073792}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.722479522228241, 'probability': 0.4855468273162842}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -4.529942543740617e-06, 'probability': 0.9999955296516418}]"

Methods: Forty-two consecutive patients scheduled for hip arthroscopy were randomized into 2 postoperative pain control groups. One group received preemptive intra-articular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection, and the second group received preemptive periacetabular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection. Before closure all patients received an additional dose of 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% intra-articularly. Data were compared with respect to postoperative pain with visual analog scale (VAS) and analgesic consumption, documented in a pain diary for 2 weeks after surgery.

Results: Twenty-one patients were treated with intra-articular injection, and 21 patients with peri-acetabular injection. There were no significant differences with regards to patient demographics or surgical procedures. VAS scores recorded during the first 30 minutes postoperatively and 18 hours after surgery were significantly lower in the periacetabular group compared with in the intra-articular group (0.667 ± 1.49 vs 2.11 ± 2.29; P < .045 and 2.62 ± 2.2 vs 4.79 ± 2.6; P < .009).

Methods: Forty-two consecutive patients scheduled for hip arthroscopy were randomized into 2 postoperative pain control groups. One group received preemptive intra-articular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection, and the second group received preemptive periacetabular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection. Before closure all patients received an additional dose of 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% intra-articularly. Data were compared with respect to postoperative pain with visual analog scale (VAS) and analgesic consumption, documented in a pain diary for 2 weeks after surgery.

Results: Twenty-one patients were treated with intra-articular injection, and 21 patients with peri-acetabular injection. There were no significant differences with regards to patient demographics or surgical procedures. VAS scores recorded during the first 30 minutes postoperatively were 0.667 ± 1.49 in the periacetabular group versus 2.11 ± 2.29 in the intra-articular group (P < .045). VAS scores at 18 hours after surgery were 2.62 ± 2.2 in the periacetabular group versus 4.79 ± 2.6 in the intra-articular group (P < .009).

lipoprotein cholesterol were observed in the topiramate compared with the 
placebo group. There were no concerning changes in neurocognitive function or 
bone health.

apply, and cost effective method for controlling pain after total knee 
arthroplasty (TKA). However, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a major 
concern. 5-Hydroxytryptamine receptor 3 (5-HT3) antagonists like ondansetron and

unclear.
METHODS: Patients were randomized preoperatively to either intravenous 
ondansetron (8 mg) or ramosetron (0.3 mg). The primary outcomes were the 
incidence rates of PONV. Secondary outcomes were the need for a rescue 
antiemetic (metoclopramide), pain score, patient satisfaction, and adverse drug

Design: A randomised controlled trial of 503 participants followed for six months.

Setting: Participants were recruited from two tertiary acute care settings in Kingston, ON, Canada.

Participants: The broad inclusion criteria were patients aged і16 presenting for acute medical assessment and treatment of a simple grade 1 or 2 ankle sprain. Exclusions were patients with multiple injuries, other conditions limiting mobility, and ankle injuries that required immobilisation and those unable to accommodate the time intensive study protocol.

Intervention: Participants received either usual care, consisting of written instructions regarding protection, rest, cryotherapy, compression, elevation, and graduated weight bearing activities, or usual care enhanced with a supervised programme of physiotherapy.

Main outcome measures: The primary outcome of efficacy was the proportion of participants reporting excellent recovery assessed with the foot and ankle outcome score (FAOS). Excellent recovery was defined as a score і450/500 at three months. A difference of at least 15% increase in the absolute proportion of participants with excellent recovery was deemed clinically important. Secondary analyses included the assessment of excellent recovery at one and six months; change from baseline using continuous scores at one, three, and six months; and clinical and biomechanical measures of ankle function, assessed at one, three, and six months.

Results: The absolute proportion of patients achieving excellent recovery at three months was not significantly different between the physiotherapy (98/229, 43%) and usual care (79/214, 37%) arms (absolute difference 6%, 95% confidence interval -3% to 15%).

Included patients met the migraine criteria of the International Headache Society. Patients were randomized to intranasal lidocaine or saline solution; all participants received 10 mg of intravenous metoclopramide. Patient pain intensity was assessed with an 11-point numeric rating scale score. The primary outcome measure was the change in pain scores at 15 minutes; secondary outcomes were changes in pain intensity after pain onset and need for rescue medication.

Results: Patients (n=162) were randomized into 2 groups with similar baseline migraine characteristics and numeric rating scale scores. The median reduction in numeric rating scale score at 15 minutes was 3 (interquartile range [IQR] 2 to 5) for the lidocaine group and 2 (IQR 1 to 4) for the saline solution group (median difference=1.0; 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 2.1).

Methods: A total of 181 overweight and obese adolescents aged 13-15 years old were randomized in the three study groups (""Diet & Activity,"" ""Activity,"" and Control). The Activity intervention included a 45-minute, 3-day per week supervised training program, while the Diet & Activity intervention included a supplementary 15 minutes of group-based sessions attended by the parents. The intervention lasted 3 months and the participants were followed for another 3 months after the intervention. The participants were assessed for anthropometric measures and activity and fulfilled the modified version of the questionnaire ""Family Eating and Activity Habits Questionnaire"" (FEAHQ).

Methods: A total of 181 overweight and obese adolescents aged 13-15 years old were randomized in the three study groups (""Diet & Activity,"" ""Activity,"" and Control). The Activity intervention included a 45-minute, 3-day per week supervised training program, while the Diet & Activity intervention included a supplementary 15 minutes of group-based sessions attended by the parents. The intervention lasted 3 months and the participants were followed for another 3 months after the intervention. The primary outcome was body mass index (BMI). The participants were assessed for anthropometric measures and activity and fulfilled the modified version of the questionnaire ""Family Eating and Activity Habits Questionnaire"" (FEAHQ).

Results: Both ""Activity"" only and ""Diet & Activity"" groups reduced their mean body mass index (BMI) (-1.1, 95% CI -1.3, -0.8, and -1.4, 95% CI -1.7, -1.2, respectively) compared to control at 3 months, with greater reductions at 6 months (-2.3, 95% CI -2.6, -2.0, and -3.1, 95% CI -3.3, -2.8).

141,28146397,A Prospective Randomized Study Comparing the Interference Screw and Suture Anchor Techniques for Biceps Tenodesis.,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Several methods are used to perform biceps tenodesis in patients 
with superior labrum-biceps complex (SLBC) lesions accompanied by a rotator cuff 
tear. However, limited clinical data are available regarding the best technique 
in terms of clinical and anatomic outcomes.
PURPOSE: To compare the clinical and anatomic outcomes of the interference screw 
(IS) and suture anchor (SA) fixation techniques for biceps tenodesis performed 
along with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: A total of 80 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair 
with SLBC lesions were prospectively enrolled and randomly divided according to 
the tenodesis method: the IS and SA groups. The primary outcome was the anatomic 
status of tenodesis estimated using magnetic resonance imaging or 
ultrasonography. Anatomic failure of tenodesis was determined when the biceps 
tendon was not traced in the intertubercular groove directly from the insertion 
site of the IS or SA. Secondary outcomes included functional outcomes evaluated 
with the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, American Shoulder and Elbow 
Surgeons (ASES) score, Simple Shoulder Test (SST), Constant score, Korean 
Shoulder Score (KSS), and long head of the biceps (LHB) score at least 2 years 
after surgery.
RESULTS: Thirty-three patients in the IS group and 34 in the SA group were 
monitored for more than 2 years. Nine anatomic failures of tenodesis were 
observed: 7 in the IS group and 2 in the SA group (P = .083). All postoperative 
functional scores improved compared with the preoperative scores and were not 
significantly different between the groups, including the LHB score (all P > 
.05). In a multivariate analysis using logistic regression, IS fixation (P = 
.003) and a higher work level (P = .022) were factors associated with the 
anatomic failure of tenodesis. In patients with tenodesis failure, the LHB score 
(P = .049) and the degree of Popeye deformity by the patient and examiner (P = 
.004 and .018, respectively) were statistically different compared with patients 
with intact tenodeses.

140,28146397,A Prospective Randomized Study Comparing the Interference Screw and Suture Anchor Techniques for Biceps Tenodesis.,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Several methods are used to perform biceps tenodesis in patients 
with superior labrum-biceps complex (SLBC) lesions accompanied by a rotator cuff 
tear. However, limited clinical data are available regarding the best technique 
in terms of clinical and anatomic outcomes.
PURPOSE: To compare the clinical and anatomic outcomes of the interference screw 
(IS) and suture anchor (SA) fixation techniques for biceps tenodesis performed 
along with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: A total of 80 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair 
with SLBC lesions were prospectively enrolled and randomly divided according to 
the tenodesis method: the IS and SA groups. Functional outcomes were evaluated 
with the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, American Shoulder and Elbow 
Surgeons (ASES) score, Simple Shoulder Test (SST), Constant score, Korean 
Shoulder Score (KSS), and long head of the biceps (LHB) score at least 2 years 
after surgery. The anatomic status of tenodesis was estimated using magnetic 
resonance imaging or ultrasonography, and the anatomic failure of tenodesis was 
determined when the biceps tendon was not traced in the intertubercular groove 
directly from the insertion site of the IS or SA.
RESULTS: Thirty-three patients in the IS group and 34 in the SA group were 
monitored for more than 2 years. All postoperative functional scores improved 
significantly compared with the preoperative scores (all P < .001) and were not 
significantly different between the groups, including the LHB score (all P > 
.05). Nine anatomic failures of tenodesis were observed: 7 in the IS group and 2 
in the SA group ( P = .083). In a multivariate analysis using logistic 
regression, IS fixation ( P = .003) and a higher (ie, more physically demanding) 
work level ( P = .022) were factors associated with the anatomic failure of 
tenodesis significantly. In patients with tenodesis failure, the LHB score ( P = 
.049) and the degree of Popeye deformity by the patient and examiner ( P = .004 
and .018, respectively) were statistically different compared with patients with 
intact tenodeses.
CONCLUSION: Care must be taken while performing biceps tenodesis in patients 
with a higher work level; IS fixation appears to pose a higher risk in terms of 
the anatomic failure of tenodesis than SA fixation, although functional outcomes 
were not different.",no_spin,6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.45947015285491943, 'probability': 0.6316182017326355}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -9.894321920000948e-06, 'probability': 0.9999901056289673}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.04909195750951767, 'probability': 0.9520934820175171}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -1.2040065485052764e-05, 'probability': 0.9999879002571106}]",0,0,"[{'token': 15, 'token_string': '0', 'logits': -0.1736859530210495, 'probability': 0.840560793876648}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.011108694598078728, 'probability': 0.9889528155326843}]",0,0,"[{'token': 15, 'token_string': '0', 'logits': -0.1069779172539711, 'probability': 0.8985455632209778}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.020737964659929276, 'probability': 0.9794756174087524}]",0,0,"[{'token': 15, 'token_string': '0', 'logits': -0.7331485152244568, 'probability': 0.4803940951824188}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0008432884933426976, 'probability': 0.9991570711135864}]"
134,28146402,A Multicenter Study of Early Anti-inflammatory Treatment in Patients With Acute Anterior Cruciate Ligament Tear.,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,,Claim benefit based on (+) secondary endpoint,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: It is increasingly recognized that biochemical abnormalities of the 
joint precede radiographic abnormalities of posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) 
by as much as decades. A growing body of evidence strongly suggests that the 
progression from anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury to PTOA is 
multifactorial, involving the interplay between biomechanical disturbances and 
biochemical homeostasis of articular cartilage.
PURPOSE: The purposes of this randomized study using an acute ACL injury model 
were to (1) evaluate the natural progression of inflammatory and 
chondrodegenerative biomarkers, (2) evaluate the relationship between subjective 
reports of pain and inflammatory and chondrodegenerative biomarkers, and (3) 
determine if postinjury arthrocentesis and corticosteroid injection offer the 
ability to alter this biochemical cascade.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: A total of 49 patients were randomized to 4 groups: group 1 
(corticosteroid at 4 days after ACL injury, placebo injection of saline at 2 
weeks), group 2 (placebo at 4 days after ACL injury, corticosteroid at 2 weeks), 
group 3 (corticosteroid at both time intervals), or a placebo group (saline 
injections at both time intervals). Patient-reported outcome measures and 
synovial biomarkers were collected at approximately 4 days, 11 days, and 5 weeks 
after injury. The change between the time points was assessed for all variables 
using Wilcoxon tests, and the relationship between changes in outcome scores and 
biomarkers were assessed by calculating Spearman ПЃ. Outcomes and biomarkers were 
also compared between the 4 groups using Kruskal-Wallis tests.
RESULTS: No adverse events or infections were observed in any study patients. 
With the exception of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) and tumor necrosis 
factor-inducible gene 6 (TSG-6), chondrodegenerative markers worsened over the 
first 5 weeks while all patient-reported outcomes improved during this time, 
regardless of treatment group. Patient-reported outcomes did not differ between 
patients receiving corticosteroid injections and the placebo group. However, 
increases in C-telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II), associated with 
collagen type II breakdown, were significantly greater in the placebo group 
(1.32 В± 1.10 ng/mL) than in either of the groups that received the 
corticosteroid injection within the first several days after injury (group 1: 
0.23 В± 0.27 ng/mL [ P = .01]; group 3: 0.19 В± 0.34 ng/mL [ P = .01]).
CONCLUSION: PTOA begins at the time of injury and results early on in dramatic 
matrix changes in the knee. However, it is encouraging that early intervention 
with an anti-inflammatory agent was able to affect biomarkers of chondral 
degeneration. Should early intervention lead to meaningful changes in either the 
onset or severity of symptomatic PTOA, the current treatment paradigm for 
patients with ACL injury may have to be restructured to include early aspiration 
and intra-articular intervention.",no_spin,6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.5348676443099976, 'probability': 0.5857468247413635}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -1.0132738680113107e-05, 'probability': 0.999989926815033}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.012959894724190235, 'probability': 0.9871237277984619}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -2.169585604860913e-05, 'probability': 0.9999783039093018}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.09675494581460953, 'probability': 0.9077783823013306}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -7.867782187531702e-06, 'probability': 0.9999921321868896}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.5094443559646606, 'probability': 0.6008293032646179}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -6.198863957251888e-06, 'probability': 0.9999938607215881}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.3526824414730072, 'probability': 0.7028003334999084}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -6.079655122448457e-06, 'probability': 0.9999939203262329}]"

treatment focuses on management of respiratory distress and hypoxia. High-flow 
warm humidified oxygen (HFWHO) is increasingly used, but has not been rigorously 
studied in randomised trials. We aimed to examine whether HFWHO provided 
enhanced respiratory support, thereby shortening time to weaning off oxygen.
METHODS: In this open, phase 4, randomised controlled trial, we recruited 
children aged less than 24 months with moderate bronchiolitis attending the 
emergency department of the John Hunter Hospital or the medical unit of the John 
Hunter Children's Hospital in New South Wales, Australia. Patients were randomly 
allocated (1:1) via opaque sealed envelopes to HFWHO (maximum flow of 1 L/kg per 
min to a limit of 20 L/min using 1:1 air-oxygen ratio, resulting in a maximum 
FiO2 of 0В·6) or standard therapy (cold wall oxygen 100% via infant nasal 
cannulae at low flow to a maximum of 2 L/min) using a block size of four and 
stratifying for gestational age at birth. The primary outcome was time from 
randomisation to last use of oxygen therapy. All randomised children were 
included in the primary and secondary safety analyses. This trial is registered 
with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number 
ACTRN12612000685819.
FINDINGS: From July 16, 2012, to May 1, 2015, we randomly assigned 202 children 
to either HFWHO (101 children) or standard therapy (101 children). Median time 
to weaning was 24 h (95% CI 18-28) for standard therapy and 20 h (95% CI 17-34) 
for HFWHO (hazard ratio [HR] for difference in survival distributions 0В·9 [95% 
CI 0В·7-1В·2]; log rank p=0В·61). Fewer children experienced treatment failure on 
HFWHO (14 [14%]) compared with standard therapy (33 [33%]; p=0В·0016); of these 
children, those on HFWHO were supported for longer than were those on standard 
therapy before treatment failure (HR 0В·3; 95% CI 0В·2-0В·6; p<0В·0001). 20 (61%) of 
33 children who experienced treatment failure on standard therapy were rescued 
with HFWHO. 12 (12%) of children on standard therapy required transfer to the 
intensive care unit compared with 14 (14%) of those on HFWHO (difference -1%; 
95% CI -7 to 16; p=0В·41). Four adverse events occurred (oxygen desaturation and 
condensation inhalation in the HFWHO group, and two incidences of oxygen tubing 
disconnection in the standard therapy group); none resulted in withdrawal from 
the trial. No oxygen-related serious adverse events occurred. Secondary 
effectiveness outcomes are reported in the Results section.
INTERPRETATION: HFWHO did not significantly reduce time on oxygen compared with 
standard therapy, suggesting that early use of HFWHO does not modify the 
underlying disease process in moderately severe bronchiolitis. HFWHO might have 
a role as a rescue therapy to reduce the proportion of children requiring

178,28209275,Contact Kinematic Differences Between Gap Balanced vs Measured Resection Techniques for Single Radius Posterior-Stabilized Total Knee Arthroplasty.,The Journal of Arthroplasty,,"""Trend toward significance"" // ""Numerically longer survival"" or equivalent verbiage, Claim benefit based on (+) subgroup analysis",Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Measured resection (MR) and gap balancing (GB) are common surgical 
techniques for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Controversy has arisen as each 
conceptually differs in how the knee is balanced through bone and soft tissue 
management. The objective of the present study was to compare both the frequency 
of condylar liftoff and the location of femorotibial contact from extension 
through midflexion between patients undergoing GB or MR TKA.
METHODS: A total of 24 knees (23 patients) were randomly assigned at referral to 
either a surgeon performing MR or GB TKA with the same single radius, 
posterior-stabilized implant (12 per cohort). At 1-year postoperation, patients 
underwent biplanar radiographic imaging at 0В°, 20В°, 40В°, and 60В° of flexion. 
Condylar liftoff, contact location, and magnitude of excursion on each condyle 
were measured. Preoperative and postoperative clinical outcome scores were also 
collected.
RESULTS: There was no difference (PВ = .41) in the frequency of liftoff between 
cohorts. The MR cohort had more posterior contact on the medial condyle (P < 
.01) and more anterior contact on the lateral condyle (P < .01) throughout 
flexion. Motion patterns were similar between cohorts, with similar medial (PВ = 
.48) and lateral (PВ = .44) excursion, which was equal in magnitude between 
condyles for both MR (PВ = .48) and GB (PВ = .73). There was no difference in 
clinical outcome scores between groups.
CONCLUSION: For this particular implant system, GB and MR appear to produce 
similar kinematic and patient-reported outcome results.",no_spin,"This abstract is not about a cancer treatment, it's about a surgical technique for total knee arthroplasty. However, I'll answer the question as requested.

179,28209275,Contact Kinematic Differences Between Gap Balanced vs Measured Resection Techniques for Single Radius Posterior-Stabilized Total Knee Arthroplasty.,The Journal of Arthroplasty,,"""Trend toward significance"" // ""Numerically longer survival"" or equivalent verbiage, Claim benefit based on (+) subgroup analysis",Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Measured resection (MR) and gap balancing (GB) are common surgical 
techniques for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Controversy has arisen as each 
conceptually differs in how the knee is balanced through bone and soft tissue 
management. The objective of the present study was to compare both the frequency 
of condylar liftoff and the location of femorotibial contact from extension 
through midflexion between patients undergoing GB or MR TKA.
METHODS: A total of 24 knees (23 patients) were randomly assigned at referral to 
either a surgeon performing MR or GB TKA with the same single radius, 
posterior-stabilized implant (12 per cohort). At 1-year postoperation, patients 
underwent biplanar radiographic imaging at 0°, 20°, 40°, and 60° of flexion. 
Condylar liftoff, contact location, and magnitude of excursion on each condyle 
were measured. Preoperative and postoperative clinical outcome scores were also 
collected.
RESULTS: There was no difference (P = .41) in the frequency of liftoff between 
cohorts. The MR cohort had more posterior contact on the medial condyle (P < 
.01) and more anterior contact on the lateral condyle (P < .01) throughout 
flexion. Motion patterns were similar between cohorts, with similar medial (P = 
.48) and lateral (P = .44) excursion, which was equal in magnitude between 
condyles for both MR (P = .48) and GB (P = .73). There was no difference in 
clinical outcome scores between groups.
CONCLUSION: Gap balancing was not more effective than measured resection in 
patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.",spin,"This abstract is not about cancer, it's about total knee arthroplasty. However, I'll still evaluate the abstract for spin.

were being discharged after ED asthma treatment. Intervention subjects received 
a 1-month prescription for an inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone or budesonide

118,28281235,The Use of Unidirectional Knotless Barbed Suture for Enterotomy Closure in Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: a Randomized Comparative Study.,Obesity Surgery,RESULTS: Focus on (+) secondary endpoint,Other;Claim benefit based on (+) secondary endpoint,Obesity,claude_4.0-sonnet,"PURPOSE: In this study, we assessed feasibility, safety, and time efficiency of 
laparoscopic running enterotomy closure for linear stapled Roux-en-Y Gastric 
Bypass (RYGB) using unidirectional barbed sutures (Stratafixв„ў 2/0- Ethicon).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred patients undergoing laparoscopic RYGB were 
prospectively randomized regarding running enterotomy closure of the linear 
stapled gastrojejunal (GJA) and jejunojejunal anastomosis (JJA). Two groups were 
created: V-group (VicrylВ® 2/0-Ethicon) and S-group (Stratafixв„ў 2/0-Ethicon). 
Time spent on closing the enterotomies was measured from first needle in until 
knot and cut (V-group) or last stitch and cut (S-group). If needed, a 
nonabsorbable ""correction"" (""c""; in order to close a small hiatus at the 
anastomosis) or hemostatic (""h"") stitch was made (using a single ProleneВ® 
2/0-Ethicon).
RESULTS: Average total procedure time was similar (S-group 1:01:22, V-group 
1:00:44, PВ =В 0.340). Closure of the enterotomy (GJA) was significantly shorter 
in the S-group (07:41В min versus 08:13В min in the V-group, PВ =В 0.005). Extra 
stitches (GJA) were performed in 33 patients (16.5%): 3 (h) and 20 (c) in the 
V-group and 1 (h) and 9 (c) in the S-group. Four patients in the V-group 
suffered from postoperative intraluminal bleeding (3 self-limiting, 1 underwent 
endoscopic clipping). In the S-group, 1 patient suffered from leakage at the 
vertical transected staple line of the stomach.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of unidirectional barbed sutures for running enterotomy

laparoscopic running enterotomy closure for linear stapled Roux-en-Y Gastric 
Bypass (RYGB) using unidirectional barbed sutures (Stratafixв„ў 2/0- Ethicon).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred patients undergoing laparoscopic RYGB were 
prospectively randomized regarding running enterotomy closure of the linear 
stapled gastrojejunal (GJA) and jejunojejunal anastomosis (JJA). Two groups were 
created: V-group (VicrylВ® 2/0-Ethicon) and S-group (Stratafixв„ў 2/0-Ethicon). 
Time spent on closing the enterotomies was measured from first needle in until 
knot and cut (V-group) or last stitch and cut (S-group). If needed, a 
nonabsorbable ""correction"" (""c""; in order to close a small hiatus at the 
anastomosis) or hemostatic (""h"") stitch was made (using a single ProleneВ® 
2/0-Ethicon).
RESULTS: Average total procedure time was similar (S-group 1:01:22, V-group 
1:00:44, PВ =В 0.340). Closure of the enterotomy (GJA) was 07:41В min in the 
S-group versus 08:13В min in the V-group (PВ =В 0.005). Extra stitches (GJA) 
were performed in 33 patients (16.5%): 3 (h) and 20 (c) in the V-group and 1 
(h) and 9 (c) in the S-group. Four patients in the V-group suffered from 
postoperative intraluminal bleeding (3 self-limiting, 1 underwent endoscopic 
clipping). In the S-group, 1 patient suffered from leakage at the vertical 
transected staple line of the stomach.
CONCLUSIONS: Unidirectional barbed sutures were not more effective than 
conventional sutures for overall procedure time in patients undergoing

HYPOTHESIS: The quality of cartilage repair and clinical outcomes would be 
superior in patients undergoing high tibial osteotomy (HTO) with microfracture 
and collagen augmentation compared to those undergoing HTO with microfracture 
alone without collagen augmentation for the treatment of medial compartment

METHODS: Twenty-eight patients undergoing HTO were randomized into 2 groups: 
microfracture alone (group 1, n = 14) or microfracture with collagen 
augmentation (group 2, n = 14). At 1 year postoperatively, second-look 
arthroscopic surgery and biopsy of repaired cartilage were performed at the time 
of HTO plate removal. Biopsy specimens were graded using the International 
Cartilage Repair Society Visual Assessment Scale II (ICRS II). In addition, 
imaging outcomes in terms of the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage 
repair tissue (MOCART) score were assessed based on magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI). Finally, clinical outcomes in terms of the visual analog scale (VAS) for 
pain score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International 
Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and Tegner activity scale score were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: The mean ICRS II score in group 2 was significantly higher than that in 
group 1 (1053.2 vs 885.4, respectively; P = .002). Group 2 showed greater 
improvement in tissue morphology, cell morphology, surface architecture, 
middle/deep zone assessment, and overall assessment compared with group 1 ( P < 
.050 for all comparisons). Imaging outcomes based on the MOCART score were 
superior in group 2 compared to those in group 1 on MRI at 1 year

CONCLUSION: The quality of cartilage repair after microfracture with collagen

Biological analysis of PRP has demonstrated an anti-inflammatory effect on the intra-articular environment.

Purpose: To compare the clinical and biological effects of an intra-articular injection of PRP with those of an intra-articular injection of HA in patients with mild to moderate knee OA.

Study design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods: A total of 111 patients with symptomatic unilateral knee OA received a series of either leukocyte-poor PRP or HA injections under ultrasound guidance. Clinical data were collected before treatment and at 4 time points across a 1-year period. Synovial fluid was also collected for analysis of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers before treatment and at 12 and 24 weeks after treatment. Several measures were used to assess results: (1) Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale; (2) International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee evaluation, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, and Lysholm knee score; and (3) difference in intra-articular biochemical marker concentrations.

Results: There were 49 patients randomized to treatment with PRP and 50 randomized to treatment with HA. No difference was seen between the groups in the primary outcome measure (WOMAC pain score). In the secondary outcome measure, linear contrasts identified a significantly higher IKDC score in the PRP group compared with the HA group at 24 weeks (mean ± standard error [SE], 65.5 ± 3.6 vs 55.8 ± 3.8, respectively; P = .013) and at final follow-up (52 weeks) (57.6 ± 3.37 vs 46.6 ± 3.76, respectively; P = .003). Linear contrasts also identified a statistically lower VAS score in the PRP group versus the HA group at 24 weeks (mean ± SE, 34.6 ± 3.24 vs 48.6 ± 3.7, respectively; P = .0096) and 52 weeks (44 ± 4.6 vs 57.3 ± 3.8, respectively; P = .0039). An examination of fixed effects showed that patients with mild OA and a lower body mass index had a statistically significant improvement in outcomes. In the biochemical analysis, differences between groups approached significance for interleukin-1_ (mean ± SE, 0.14 ± 0.05 pg/mL [PRP] vs 0.34 ± 0.16 pg/mL [HA]; P = .06) and tumor necrosis factor _ (0.08 ± 0.01 pg/mL [PRP] vs 0.2 ± 0.18 pg/mL [HA]; P = .068) at 12-week follow-up.

Conclusion: We found no difference between HA and PRP at any time point in the primary outcome measure: the patient-reported WOMAC pain score. Significant improvements were seen in other patient-reported outcome measures, with results favoring PRP over HA.

Biological analysis of PRP has demonstrated an anti-inflammatory effect on the intra-articular environment.

Purpose: To compare the clinical and biological effects of an intra-articular injection of PRP with those of an intra-articular injection of HA in patients with mild to moderate knee OA.

Study design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods: A total of 111 patients with symptomatic unilateral knee OA received a series of either leukocyte-poor PRP or HA injections under ultrasound guidance. Clinical data were collected before treatment and at 4 time points across a 1-year period. Synovial fluid was also collected for analysis of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers before treatment and at 12 and 24 weeks after treatment. Several measures were used to assess results: (1) Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale (primary outcome); (2) International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee evaluation, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, and Lysholm knee score; and (3) difference in intra-articular biochemical marker concentrations.

Results: There were 49 patients randomized to treatment with PRP and 50 randomized to treatment with HA. No difference was seen between the groups in the primary outcome measure (WOMAC pain score). In the secondary outcome measure, linear contrasts identified a higher IKDC score in the PRP group compared with the HA group at 24 weeks (mean ± standard error [SE], 65.5 ± 3.6 vs 55.8 ± 3.8, respectively; P = .013) and at final follow-up (52 weeks) (57.6 ± 3.37 vs 46.6 ± 3.76, respectively; P = .003). Linear contrasts also identified a lower VAS score in the PRP group versus the HA group at 24 weeks (mean ± SE, 34.6 ± 3.24 vs 48.6 ± 3.7, respectively; P = .0096) and 52 weeks (44 ± 4.6 vs 57.3 ± 3.8, respectively; P = .0039). In the biochemical analysis, differences between groups approached significance for interleukin-1_ (mean ± SE, 0.14 ± 0.05 pg/mL [PRP] vs 0.34 ± 0.16 pg/mL [HA]; P = .06) and tumor necrosis factor _ (0.08 ± 0.01 pg/mL [PRP] vs 0.2 ± 0.18 pg/mL [HA]; P = .068) at 12-week follow-up.

RESULTS: Both patient groups experienced significant improvement in all 
measures. Between-group comparisons showed a significantly higher value in the

Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) and grip strength measured with a 
calibrated hand dynamometer.
RESULTS: Between-group comparisons showed a significantly higher value in the 
PRP group only for grip strength at week 8 (P = .0073); all other significant 
differences were in favor of arthroscopy: overall pain (P = .0021), night pain 
(P = .0013), and PRTEE score (P = .0013) at week 104 and grip strength at weeks 
24, 52, and 104 (all P < .0001). Consumption of rescue pain medication was not 
significantly different between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic lateral release was not more effective than PRP 
injections on pain in patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis.",spin,2,2,"[{'token': 17, 'token_string': '2', 'logits': -0.10205308347940445, 'probability': 0.9029816389083862}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -3.6954811548639555e-06, 'probability': 0.9999962449073792}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.9940049648284912, 'probability': 0.3700914978981018}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -1.3470558769768104e-05, 'probability': 0.9999865293502808}]",2,2,"[{'token': 17, 'token_string': '2', 'logits': -1.3078182935714722, 'probability': 0.27040934562683105}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -3.814689989667386e-06, 'probability': 0.9999961853027344}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.1157208681106567, 'probability': 0.32767897844314575}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -8.821448318485636e-06, 'probability': 0.999991238117218}]",2,2,"[{'token': 17, 'token_string': '2', 'logits': -0.17531812191009521, 'probability': 0.8391900658607483}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -2.861018856492592e-06, 'probability': 0.999997079372406}]"

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) seems to achieve equal weight loss as laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), but there is still much debate about the quality of life (QOL) after LSG, mainly concerning the association with gastroesophageal reflux. Our hypothesis is that QOL after LSG is comparable with QOL after LRYGB.

Materials and methods: Between February 2013 and February 2014, 150 patients were randomized to undergo either LSG or LRYGB in our clinic. Differences in QOL were compared between groups by using multiple QOL questionnaires at follow-up moments preoperatively and 2 and 12 months after surgery.

Results: After 12 months of follow-up, 128 patients had returned the questionnaires. Most QOL questionnaires showed significant improvement in scores between the preoperative moment and after 12 months of follow-up. The Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Questionnaire (GerdQ) score deteriorated in the LSG group after 2 months, but recovered again after 12 months. After 2 months of follow-up, the mean GerdQ score was 6.95 ± 2.14 in the LSG group versus 5.50 ± 1.49 in the LRYGB group (p < 0.001). After 1 year, the mean GerdQ score was 6.63 ± 2.26 in the LSG group and 5.60 ± 1.07 in the LRYGB group (p = 0.001).

Methods: Sixty morbid obese patients (BMI і 35) were evaluated before and after 12 weeks of bariatric surgery in order to compare the impact of two different exercise programs on body composition and functional capacity outcomes. Participants were divided into three groups: aerobic (A), aerobic-strength (AS), and control (C) group. Aerobic capacity was assessed with 12-min walk-run test (12MWRT). One-repetition maximum (1RM) test was performed to evaluation upper limb muscle strength. Lower extremity functional capacity was assessed by sit-to-stand test.

Results: Weight, percent body fat (PBF), and fat mass (FM) reduced greater in the trial groups in comparison to the C group (P < 0.05). In the AS group, the reduction of fat-free mass (FFM) was significantly lower than that in the other groups. Mean changes in 12MWRT increased significantly in the intervention groups. The mean change in the sit-to-stand scores was not statistically significant between the three groups. Comparing the intervention groups showed that mean changes in 1RM variables increased in AS group (P = 0.03).

have increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 
(MRSA). For cellulitis without purulent drainage, ОІ-hemolytic streptococci are 
presumed to be the predominant pathogens. It is unknown if antimicrobial 
regimens possessing in vitro MRSA activity provide improved outcomes compared 
with treatments lacking MRSA activity.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 
yields a higher clinical cure rate of uncomplicated cellulitis than cephalexin 
alone.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized 
superiority trial in 5 US emergency departments among outpatients older than 12 
years with cellulitis and no wound, purulent drainage, or abscess enrolled from 
April 2009 through June 2012. All participants had soft tissue ultrasound 
performed at the time of enrollment to exclude abscess. Final follow-up was 
August 2012.
INTERVENTIONS: Cephalexin, 500 mg 4 times daily, plus 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily, for 7 days (nвЂ‰=вЂ‰248 
participants) or cephalexin plus placebo for 7 days (nвЂ‰=вЂ‰248 participants).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome determined a priori in the 
per-protocol group was clinical cure, defined as absence of these clinical 
failure criteria at follow-up visits: fever; increase in erythema (>25%), 
swelling, or tenderness (days 3-4); no decrease in erythema, swelling, or 
tenderness (days 8-10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness 
(days 14-21). A clinically significant difference was defined as greater than 
10%.
RESULTS: Among 500 randomized participants, 496 (99%) were included in the 
modified intention-to-treat analysis and 411 (82.2%) in the per-protocol 
analysis (median age, 40 years [range, 15-78 years]; 58.4% male; 10.9% had 
diabetes). Median length and width of erythema were 13.0 cm and 10.0 cm. In the 
per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 182 (83.5%) of 218 
participants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 165 
(85.5%) of 193 in the cephalexin group (difference, -2.0%; 95% CI, -9.7% to 
5.7%; PвЂ‰=вЂ‰.50). In the modified intention-to-treat population, clinical cure 
occurred in 189 (76.2%) of 248 participants in the cephalexin plus 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 171 (69.0%) of 248 in the cephalexin

of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared to cephalexin alone

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether TTM at 33В°C for 48 hours results in better 
neurologic outcomes compared with currently recommended, standard, 24-hour TTM.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was an international, 
investigator-initiated, blinded-outcome-assessor, parallel, pragmatic, 
multicenter, randomized clinical superiority trial in 10 intensive care units 
(ICUs) at 10 university hospitals in 6 European countries. Three hundred 
fifty-five adult, unconscious patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were 
enrolled from February 16, 2013, to June 1, 2016, with final follow-up on 
December 27, 2016.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to TTM (33вЂ‰В±вЂ‰1В°C) for 48 hours (nвЂ‰=вЂ‰176) 
or 24 hours (nвЂ‰=вЂ‰179), followed by gradual rewarming of 0.5В°C per hour until

favorable outcome. Secondary outcomes included 6-month mortality, including time 
to death, the occurrence of adverse events, and intensive care unit resource

RESULTS: In 355 patients who were randomized (mean age, 60 years; 295 [83%] 
men), 351 (99%) completed the trial. Of these patients, 69% (120/175) in the

-16.1% to 3.1%; RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.59-1.11; PвЂ‰=вЂ‰.19). There was no significant 
difference in the time to mortality between the 48-hour group and the 24-hour

cuff repair to improve tendon-bone healing and potentially reduce the incidence 
of subsequent tendon retears.
PURPOSE: To investigate whether the midterm clinical and radiographic outcomes 
of arthroscopic supraspinatus repair are enhanced after repeated postoperative 
applications of PRP.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: A total of 60 patients (30 control; 30 PRP) were initially randomized 
to receive 2 ultrasound-guided injections of PRP to the tendon repair site at 7 
and 14 days after double-row arthroscopic supraspinatus repair or not. A total 
of 55 patients (91.7%) underwent a clinical review and magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) at a mean of 3.5 years after surgery (range, 36-51 months). 
Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) included the Constant score, Quick 
Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH) questionnaire, Oxford 
Shoulder Score (OSS), and visual analog scale (VAS) for pain. Global rating of 
change (GRC) scale and patient satisfaction scores were evaluated. Structural 
integrity of the surgical repair was assessed via MRI using the Sugaya 
classification system.
RESULTS: At the midterm review, there was no difference between the groups for 
any of the PROMs. No differences between the groups were demonstrated for the 
subjective and range of motion subscales of the Constant score. The Constant 
strength subscale score was higher in the PRP group (3.3 points; 95% CI, 1.0-5.7; 
P = .006). There was no evidence for any group differences in MRI scores or retear 
rates, with 66.7% of PRP patients and 64.3% of control patients rated as Sugaya 
grade 1. Two control patients had symptomatic retears (both full thickness) within 
the first 16 weeks after surgery compared with 2 PRP patients, who suffered 
symptomatic retears (both partial thickness) between 16 weeks and a mean 3.5-year 
follow-up.

cuff repair to improve tendon-bone healing and potentially reduce the incidence 
of subsequent tendon retears.
PURPOSE: To investigate whether the midterm clinical and radiographic outcomes 
of arthroscopic supraspinatus repair are enhanced after repeated postoperative 
applications of PRP.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: A total of 60 patients (30 control; 30 PRP) were initially randomized 
to receive 2 ultrasound-guided injections of PRP to the tendon repair site at 7 
and 14 days after double-row arthroscopic supraspinatus repair or not. A total 
of 55 patients (91.7%) underwent a clinical review and magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) at a mean of 3.5 years after surgery (range, 36-51 months). 
Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) included the Constant score, Quick 
Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH) questionnaire, Oxford 
Shoulder Score (OSS), and visual analog scale (VAS) for pain. Global rating of 
change (GRC) scale and patient satisfaction scores were evaluated. Structural 
integrity of the surgical repair was assessed via MRI using the Sugaya 
classification system.
RESULTS: At the midterm review, there was no difference between the groups for 
any of the PROMs. No differences between the groups were demonstrated for the 
subjective and range of motion subscales of the Constant score, although a 
significantly higher Constant strength subscale score was observed in the PRP 
group (3.3 points; 95% CI, 1.0-5.7; P = .006). There was no evidence for any 
group differences in MRI scores or retear rates, with 66.7% of PRP patients and 
64.3% of control patients rated as Sugaya grade 1. Two control patients had 
symptomatic retears (both full thickness) within the first 16 weeks after 
surgery compared with 2 PRP patients, who suffered symptomatic retears (both 
partial thickness) between 16 weeks and a mean 3.5-year follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Significant postoperative clinical improvements and high levels of 
patient satisfaction were observed in patients at the midterm review after 
supraspinatus repair. While pain-free, maximal abduction strength was greater in 
the midterm after PRP treatment, repeated applications of PRP delivered at 7 and 
14 days after surgery provided no additional benefit to tendon integrity.",no_spin,5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.0374114513397217, 'probability': 0.3543708026409149}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -8.4638240878121e-06, 'probability': 0.9999915957450867}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.1605556458234787, 'probability': 0.8516704440116882}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -2.4199192921514623e-05, 'probability': 0.9999757409095764}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.16800972819328308, 'probability': 0.8453456163406372}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -1.3708974620385561e-05, 'probability': 0.9999862313270569}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.3722885251045227, 'probability': 0.6891553401947021}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -6.079655122448457e-06, 'probability': 0.9999939203262329}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.3847563564777374, 'probability': 0.6806164383888245}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -6.079655122448457e-06, 'probability': 0.9999939203262329}]"

intervention program, targeting high-risk groups.
METHODS: In this unblinded randomized controlled trial, participants (recruited 
January 2012-August 2014) were aged 5 to 16 years, resided in Taranaki, 
Aotearoa/New Zealand, and had BMI ≥ 98th percentile or BMI > 91st percentile 
with weight-related comorbidities. Randomization was by minimization (age and 
ethnicity), with participants assigned to an intense intervention group 
(home-based assessments at 6-month intervals and a 12-month multidisciplinary 
program with weekly group sessions) or to a minimal-intensity control group with 
home-based assessments and advice at each 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome 
was the change in BMI standard deviation score (SDS) at 12 months from baseline. 
Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular fitness and quality of life. A mixed 
model analysis was undertaken, incorporating all 6- and 12-month data.
RESULTS: Two hundred and three children were randomly assigned (47% Māori, 43% 
New Zealand European, 53% female, 28% from the most deprived quintile, mean age 
10.7 years, mean BMI SDS 3.12). Change in BMI SDS at 12 months from baseline was 
-0.12 in the control group and -0.10 in the intervention group. Both groups had 
improvements in cardiovascular fitness (P < 0.0001) and improvements in quality 
of life (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The intensive intervention was not more effective than the control 
intervention on BMI SDS in children with obesity.",spin,2,2,"[{'token': 17, 'token_string': '2', 'logits': -0.09217050671577454, 'probability': 0.9119496941566467}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -4.410734163684538e-06, 'probability': 0.9999955892562866}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.8140525221824646, 'probability': 0.44305890798568726}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -1.2636104656849056e-05, 'probability': 0.9999873638153076}]","This abstract does not describe a study in the field of cancer, but rather a study on a child obesity intervention program.

diarrhoea and vomiting, symptoms that may lead to severe dehydration and death. 
The objective of this randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled study was to 
investigate whether ondansetron, a serotonin receptor antagonist could reduce 
the number of diarrhoea and vomiting episodes during the 24 hours following 
treatment.
METHODS: Children with acute gastroenteritis, aged 6 months to 16 years where 
enrolled (n = 104) and randomized to one single oral dose (0.15mg/kg) of 
ondansetron (n = 52) or placebo (n = 52). The primary outcome was the number of 
diarrhoea and vomiting episodes during the 24 hours following treatment. 
Secondary outcomes included the number of days with symptoms. Pathogens in 
faeces were diagnosed by real-time PCR.
RESULTS: The number of diarrhoea and vomiting episodes during the 24 hours 
following treatment was not significantly different between ondansetron and 
placebo groups. One dose of oral ondansetron reduced duration of rotavirus 
clinical symptoms (p = 0.014), with a median of two days. Furthermore, 
ondansetron reduced diarrhea episodes, most pronounced in children that had been

varieties of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) as an adjuvant to arthroscopic rotator 
cuff repair (ARCR) result in improved tendon healing rates.
PURPOSE: To perform a network meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials 
in the literature to ascertain whether there is evidence to support the use of 
LP- or LR-PRP as an adjunct to ARCR.
METHODS: The literature search was based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Randomized 
controlled trials comparing LP- or LR-PRP with a control alongside ARCR were 
included. Clinical outcomes, including retears and functional outcomes, were 
compared using a frequentist approach to network meta-analysis, with statistical 
analysis performed using R. The treatment options were ranked using the P-score.
RESULTS: There were 13 studies (868 patients) included, with 9 studies comparing 
LP-PRP with a control and 4 studies comparing LR-PRP with a control. LP-PRP was 
found to significantly reduce the rate of retear and/or incomplete tendon 
healing after fixation, even among medium-large tears; it also improved outcomes 
on the visual analog scale for pain, Constant score, and University of 
California Los Angeles score. LP-PRP had the highest P-score for all treatment 
groups. LR-PRP did not result in any significant improvements over the control 
group, except for visual analog scale score for pain. However, post hoc analysis 
revealed that LP-PRP did not lead to significant improvements over LR-PRP in any 
category.
CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrates that LP-PRP reduces the rate of 
retear and/or incomplete tendon healing after ARCR and improves patient-reported 
outcomes as compared with a control. However, it is still unclear whether LP-PRP 
improves the tendon healing rate when compared with LR-PRP.",no_spin,8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.03171125054359436, 'probability': 0.9687862396240234}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -1.3589766240329482e-05, 'probability': 0.999986469745636}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.10034795105457306, 'probability': 0.9045226573944092}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -1.597391747054644e-05, 'probability': 0.9999839663505554}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.1703900694847107, 'probability': 0.8433358073234558}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -6.9141146923357155e-06, 'probability': 0.999993085861206}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.09730323404073715, 'probability': 0.9072808623313904}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -4.887569048150908e-06, 'probability': 0.9999951124191284}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.06757870316505432, 'probability': 0.934654176235199}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -4.887569048150908e-06, 'probability': 0.9999951124191284}]"
