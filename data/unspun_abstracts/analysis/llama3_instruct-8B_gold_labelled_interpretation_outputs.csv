254,18237696,Prospective randomized comparison of anatomic single- and double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy",  Focus on (+) secondary endpoint,,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Purpose
To determine if anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is superior to anatomic single-bundle reconstruction in restoring the stabilities and functions of the knee joint.
Methods
A prospective randomized clinical study was done to compare the results of 32 cases of anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction and 34 cases of anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction with average follow-up of 16.3 В± 3.1В months. Tunnel placements of all the cases were measured on 3D CT. Clinical results were collected after reconstruction; graft's appearance, meniscus status and cartilage state under arthroscopy were compared and analysed too.
Results
Tunnel placements, confirmed with 3D CT, were in the anatomic positions as described in literature both in SB and DB group. No differences were found between SB and DB groups in clinical outcome scores, pivot shift test and KT 1000В measurements (average side-to-side difference for anterior tibial translation was 0.7В mm in SB group and 1.0В mm in DB group). More than 70 % of the single-bundle graft and AM bundle graft in DB group appeared excellent, but only 44.1 % of PL bundle grafts in DB group were excellent and 11.8 % were in poor state. No new menisci tear was found either in SB or DB group, however, in DB group cartilage damages in medial patella-femoral joint occurred in 38.2 % cases. This rate was significantly higher than in the SB group which is only 9.3 %.
Conclusion
Both single- and double-bundle anatomic ACL reconstruction can restore the knee's stability and functions very well. However, more incidences of poor PL status and medial patellar-femoral cartilage damage may occur in double-bundle ACL reconstruction.",no_spin,6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.6717355251312256, 'probability': 0.5108212232589722}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0003771070914808661, 'probability': 0.9996229410171509}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.37220045924186707, 'probability': 0.6892160773277283}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00038092033355496824, 'probability': 0.99961918592453}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.0470162630081177, 'probability': 0.3509834408760071}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0002783149539027363, 'probability': 0.9997217059135437}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -1.0375230312347412, 'probability': 0.35433125495910645}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00020680672605521977, 'probability': 0.9997931718826294}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.8223590850830078, 'probability': 0.43939387798309326}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00024387246230617166, 'probability': 0.9997561573982239}]"

dextrose in normal saline solution compared with normal saline solution will 
lead to a lower proportion of hospitalized patients and a greater reduction in 
serum ketone levels in children with gastroenteritis and dehydration.
METHODS: We enrolled children aged 6 months to 6 years in a double-blind, 
randomized controlled trial of patients presenting to a pediatric emergency 
department. Subjects were randomized to receive a 20 mL/kg infusion of either 5% 
dextrose in normal saline solution or normal saline solution. Serum ketone 
levels were measured before and at 1- and 2-hour intervals after the initial 
study fluid bolus administration. Primary outcome was the proportion of children 
hospitalized. Secondary outcome was change in serum ketone levels over time.
RESULTS: One hundred eighty-eight children were enrolled. The proportion of 
children hospitalized did not differ between groups (35% in the 5% dextrose in 
normal saline solution group versus 44% in the normal saline solution group;

Methods: In the present prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical study, 30 patients were divided into two groups: 15 patients (group I) were treated with arthroscopy-guided suprascapular nerve block using 10 mL 0.5 % ropivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine, and 15 patients (group II) were treated with placebo using 10 mL 0.9 % saline after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Patient pain levels were measured using the visual analog scale (VAS) at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h post-operatively.

198,23455386,Efficacy of direct arthroscopy-guided suprascapular nerve block after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair: a prospective randomized study.,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy",,Claim benefit based on (+) secondary endpoint,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of arthroscopy-guided direct suprascapular nerve block performed after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

Methods: In the present prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical study, 30 patients were divided into two groups: 15 patients (group I) were treated with arthroscopy-guided suprascapular nerve block using 10 mL 0.5 % ropivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine, and 15 patients (group II) were treated with placebo using 10 mL 0.9 % saline after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Patient pain levels were measured using the visual analog scale (VAS) at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h post-operatively. Additionally, the number of boluses and total amount of fentanyl dispensed by patient-controlled analgesia administration during the 24-h post-operative period were evaluated.

Results: VAS scores did not differ significantly between groups I and II during the 24-h post-operative period, but mean fentanyl bolus consumption was significantly less in group I compared with group II (p = 0.015).

Conclusion: Arthroscopy-guided suprascapular nerve block at the end of a rotator cuff repair was safe and less time-consuming than expected.

Questions/purposes: We (1) compared three-planar component alignment and overall coronal mechanical alignment between PSG and conventional instrumentation and (2) logged the need for applying changes in the suggested position of the PSG.

Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, we enrolled 128 patients. The primary outcome was overall coronal mechanical alignment.

was 500 mL normal saline solution and then 67 mL/hour for up to 24 hours. The 
primary outcome was contrast-induced nephropathy, defined as an increase in 
creatinine level of 25% or 0.5 mg/dL, measured 48 to 72 hours after CT.
RESULTS: The data safety and monitoring board terminated the study early for 
futility. Of 399 patients enrolled, 357 (89%) completed follow-up and were 
included. The N-acetylcysteine plus saline solution group contrast-induced 
nephropathy rate was 14 of 185 (7.6%) versus 12 of 172 (7.0%) in the normal 
saline solution only group (absolute risk difference 0.6%; 95% confidence 
interval -4.8% to 6.0%). The contrast-induced nephropathy rate in patients 
receiving less than 1 L intravenous fluids in the emergency department (ED) was 
19 of 147 (12.9%) versus 7 of 210 (3.3%) for greater than 1 L intravenous fluids 
(difference 9.6%; 95% confidence interval 3.7% to 15.5%), a 69% risk reduction 
(odds ratio 0.41; 95% confidence interval 0.21 to 0.80) per liter of intravenous 
fluids.
CONCLUSION: We did not find evidence of a benefit for N-acetylcysteine 
administration to our ED patients undergoing contrast-enhanced CT. However, we 
did find a significant association between volume of intravenous fluids 
administered and reduction in contrast-induced nephropathy.",no_spin,4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.4975309371948242, 'probability': 0.6080300807952881}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00024577934527769685, 'probability': 0.9997543096542358}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.3686951696872711, 'probability': 0.6916362643241882}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00034314466756768525, 'probability': 0.9996569752693176}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.6382083296775818, 'probability': 0.5282379984855652}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0002153879904653877, 'probability': 0.9997847080230713}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.9583133459091187, 'probability': 0.38353919982910156}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0008434075862169266, 'probability': 0.9991569519042969}]",4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.9714893698692322, 'probability': 0.37851884961128235}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.000680691737215966, 'probability': 0.9993195533752441}]"

New video-guided airway management technology is available, which may minimize the risk to patients from this procedure.

Methods: This was a controlled clinical trial conducted in the trauma receiving unit in a university-affiliated urban hospital in which 623 consecutive adult patients requiring emergency airway management were prospectively randomized to intubation with either the direct laryngoscope (DL) or the GlideScope video laryngoscope (GVL) device.

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of the two procedures in patients older than 55 years of age affected by reparable rotator cuff tears with concomitant long head biceps pathologies.

Methods: Patients older than 55 years of age with long head biceps lesions and reparable rotator cuff tears were selected for this study. A total of 151 patients were randomly assigned to the tenotomy group (77 patients) or the tenodesis group (74 patients). Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was performed in all the patients. Before surgery, physical and radiological examinations were performed; the constant score was measured as well. After the operation, the surgical time, cost, pain (VAS scores), Popeye sign, cramping pain, constant scores, satisfaction level and the elbow flexion and forearm supination strength indices were recorded.

Results: Patients were followed for an average of 24 months. No significant differences in the clinical results for the constant scores, the forearm supination and elbow flexion strength indices, Popeye sign, cramping pain and satisfaction level were found between the groups. However, tenotomy required a shorter surgical time (40.4 ± 4.0 vs. 50.4 ± 5.9 min, P < 0.001) and resulted in faster pain relief (3.1 ± 1.8 vs. 4.8 ± 1.9, P < 0.001).

Conclusion: Both tenotomy and tenodesis are effective and equal for the treatment of long head biceps lesions.

However, there are unanswered questions about the performance of hemiarthroplasty over the longer term compared with internal fixation.

Questions/purposes: We sought to compare hemiarthroplasty with internal fixation in terms of (1) outcomes scores for pain, hip function, and quality of life at a minimum of 5 years after surgery in a randomized trial. A secondary purpose was to compare (2) patient survival and (3) frequency of reoperation in the two groups.

Methods: A total of 222 consecutive patients older than 60 years, including those cognitively impaired, with FNF were randomized to either internal fixation with two parallel screws or bipolar hemiarthroplasty. At a minimum followup of 4.9 years (mean, 5.9 years; range, 4.9-7.2 years), 68 of the 70 surviving patients were examined by a study nurse and study physiotherapist blinded to initial treatment. Questionnaires on hip function (Harris hip score), quality of life (Eq5D), and activity of daily living function (Barthel ADL) were administered. The Barthel ADL index score was split into good function (score 95 or 100) and reduced function (score below 95).

Results: The mean survival of the groups was similar with 66.4% (73 of 110) of the patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty and 70.5% (79 of 112) of the patients undergoing internal fixation having died since surgery (p = 0.51). Only 12 of 31 living patients in the internal fixation group had retained their native hips at a mean of 6 years. Between 2 and 6 years, there were two new major reoperations (both in the internal fixation group, for avascular necrosis and deep wound infection). The mean Harris hip score was 66 (SD 19) and 67 (SD 20) in the internal fixation and hemiarthroplasty groups, respectively (p = 0.96). The mean Eq5D index was 0.50 (SD 0.40) in the internal fixation group and 0.34 (SD 0.36) in the hemiarthroplasty group (p = 0.10). Function in terms of ADLs was comparable between the groups; of the patients in the internal fixation group, 42% reported good function on the Barthel ADL index, and the corresponding number in the hemiarthroplasty group was 51% (p = 0.44).

Most MIS TKA surgeons (and many surgeons who use other approaches as well) excise the fat pad for better exposure of the knee. There is still controversy about the result of fat pad excision on patella baja, pain, and function.

Questions/purposes: In the setting of a randomized controlled trial, we sought to determine whether infrapatellar fat pad excision during MIS TKA causes (1) patellar tendon shortening (as measured by patella baja); (2) increased anterior knee pain; (3) decreases in the Knee Society Score or functional subscore; or (4) more patella-related complications.

Methods: We randomized 90 patients undergoing MIS TKA at one institution into two groups. In one group, 45 patients underwent MIS TKA with complete infrapatellar fat pad excision and in the other group, 45 patients received MIS TKA without infrapatellar fat pad excision. The patella was selectively resurfaced in these patients; there was no difference between the groups in terms of the percentage of patients whose patellae were resurfaced. We measured patellar tendon shortening, knee flexion, anterior knee pain, Knee Society Score (KSS), functional subscore, and patellar complications at preoperative and postoperative periods of 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year; complete followup data were available on 86% of patients (77 of 90) who were enrolled.

Results: At the final followup, no significant differences were observed in patellar tendon shortening, KSS, functional subscore, or knee flexion in either group. However, patients with their infrapatellar fat pad excised experienced more anterior knee pain (8.3% versus 0%; p = 0.03; 95% confidence interval, -0.007 to 0.174) at the end of the study. No patellar complications were found in either group.

single-injection FNB or a spinal anesthetic plus a continuous postoperative 
intraarticular infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine. All patients were blinded to their

RESULTS: The frequency of nausea and hypertension was not different between the

ropivacaine group, though not in-hospital falls. No infections occurred in 
either group, and the frequency of complications was not different between 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: A continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine can be 
recommended as a safe, effective alternative to epidural analgesia plus 
single-injection FNB after TKA. Improved analgesic efficacy in the group that 
received epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB must be weighed against 
the disadvantage of a higher likelihood of knee buckling and delayed ambulation 
with that treatment approach.

because of their ability to engage the reader. Our objective was to evaluate the 
effectiveness of story booklets compared to standard information sheets for

METHODS: Parents were randomized to receive story booklets (n=208) or standard 
information sheets (n=205) during their ED visit. The primary outcome was change 
in anxiety between triage to ED discharge as measured by the State-Trait Anxiety 
Inventory. Follow-up telephone interviews were conducted at 1 and 3 days after 
discharge, then every other day until 9 days (or until resolution of symptoms), 
and at 1 year. Secondary outcomes included: expected future anxiety, event 
impact, parental knowledge, satisfaction, decision regret, healthcare 
utilization, time to symptom resolution.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the primary outcome of change in 
parental anxiety between recruitment and ED discharge (change of 5 points for 
the story group vs. 6 points for the comparison group, p=0.78). The story group 
showed significantly greater decision regret regarding their decision to go to

JCPs, containing the patient's treatment preferences for any future psychiatric 
emergency, are a form of crisis intervention that aim to mitigate the negative 
consequences of relapse, including hospital admission and use of coercion. Data 
were collected at baseline and 18-months after randomisation. The primary 
outcome was admission to hospital under the Mental Health Act. The economic 
evaluation took a service perspective (health, social care and criminal justice 
services) and a societal perspective (additionally including criminal activity 
and productivity losses).
FINDINGS: The addition of JCPs to TAU had no significant effect on compulsory 
admissions or total societal cost per participant over 18-months follow-up. From 
the service cost perspective, JCPs were not significantly more cost-effective

highlights distinct patterns of costs and effects. Whilst the evidence does not 
support the cost-effectiveness of JCPs for White or Asian ethnic groups, there 
is at least a 90% probability of the JCP intervention being the more 
cost-effective option in the Black ethnic group.

Although positive effects were found after physiotherapy, the recurrence and prolonged disability of a frozen shoulder are major factors to focus on to provide the appropriate treatment.

Questions/purposes: We wished to study the effectiveness of a shoulder countertraction apparatus on ROM, pain, and function in patients with a frozen shoulder and compare their results with those of control subjects who received conventional physiotherapy.

Methods: A total of 100 participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group and a control group, with each group having 50 participants. The control group received physiotherapy and the experimental group received countertraction and physiotherapy. The total treatment time was 20 minutes a day for 5 days per week for 2 weeks.

Results: Improvements were seen in the scores for shoulder flexion (94.1Ў ± 19.79Ў at baseline increased to 161.9Ў ± 13.05Ў after intervention), abduction ROM (90.4Ў ± 21.18Ў at baseline increased to 154.8Ў ± 13.21Ў after intervention), and pain (8.00 ± 0.78 at baseline decreased to 3.48 ± 0.71 after intervention) in the experimental group.

Methods: Between January 2007 and January 2011, 87 patients who underwent arthroscopic Bankart repair with the use of knot-tying suture anchors or knotless suture anchors were evaluated, with 45 patients in the knot-tying suture group and 42 patients in the knotless group. Patients were assigned to either group, with odd-numbered patients going to the knot-tying suture arm and even-numbered patients assigned to the knotless arm. Outcomes included the Constant score, the visual analog scale (VAS) score, patient satisfaction score, and range of motion in forward flexion and external rotation with the arm in adduction. Redislocations or subluxations with the 2 techniques was also studied.

Results: Both groups showed a statistically significant improvement between the preoperative and postoperative VAS scores and Constant scores. In the knot-tying suture group, the VAS score improved from 2.5 ± 2.3 to 0.7 ± 0.5 (P < .05) and the Constant score improved from 64 ± 7 to 92 ± 10 (P < .05). In the knotless group, the VAS score improved from 2.8 ± 2.5 to 0.9 ± 0.6 (P < .05), and the Constant score improved from 62 ± 6 to 89 ± 9 (P < .05). The patient satisfaction scores were 6.9 and 7.1 for the knot tying and knotless groups, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found when comparing the outcomes between the 2 groups. The change in the range of forward flexion and external rotation was also similar in the 2 groups. There was also no difference in recurrence or redislocation rates.

Conclusions: Both the knot-tying and knotless suture anchors groups showed statistically significant and similar improvement in VAS and Constant scores. Both anchors provided reasonable outcomes.

However, recent basic science and clinical data have suggested recurrent instability may be reduced with immobilization in external rotation after primary shoulder dislocation.

Questions/purposes: We performed a randomized controlled trial to compare the (1) frequency of recurrent instability and (2) disease-specific quality-of-life scores after treatment of first-time shoulder dislocation using either immobilization in external rotation or immobilization in internal rotation in a group of young patients.

Methods: Sixty patients younger than 35 years of age with primary, traumatic, anterior shoulder dislocations were randomized (concealed, computer-generated) to immobilization with either an internal rotation sling (n = 29) or an external rotation brace (n = 31) at a mean of 4 days after closed reduction (range, 1-7 days). Patients with large bony lesions or polytrauma were excluded. The two groups were similar at baseline. Both groups were immobilized for 4 weeks with identical therapy protocols thereafter. Blinded assessments were completed by independent observers for a minimum of 12 months (mean, 25 months; range, 12-43 months). The primary outcome was recurrent instability, defined as a second documented anterior dislocation or multiple episodes of shoulder subluxation severe enough for the patient to request surgical stabilization.

Results: There was no difference in the rate of recurrent instability between groups: 10 of 27 patients (37%) with the external rotation brace versus 10 of 25 patients (40%) with the sling redislocated or developed symptomatic recurrent instability (p = 0.41).

PURPOSE: To report the short-term clinical outcomes of patients undergoing 
arthroscopic repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears with and without 
acromioplasty.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: Patients undergoing arthroscopic repair of full-thickness rotator cuff 
tears were randomized into acromioplasty or nonacromioplasty groups. The primary 
outcome was the Simple Shoulder Test (SST). Secondary outcomes included American 
Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, Constant score, University of 
California-Los Angeles (UCLA) score, and Short Form-12 (SF-12) health assessment

strength testing. Intraoperative data including tear size, repair configuration, 
and concomitant procedures were recorded. Follow-up examination was performed at 
regular intervals up to 2 years. Preoperative imaging was reviewed to classify 
the acromial morphologic type, acromial angle, and lateral acromial angulation.
RESULTS: A total of 114 patients were initially enrolled in the study, and 95

METHODS: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was

ED nausea and vomiting were randomized to receive 4 mg intravenous ondansetron, 
20 mg intravenous metoclopramide, or saline solution placebo. Primary outcome 
was mean change in visual analog scale (VAS) rating of nausea severity from 
enrollment to 30 minutes after study drug administration. Secondary outcomes 
included patient satisfaction, need for rescue antiemetic treatment, and adverse 
events.
RESULTS: Of 270 recruited patients, 258 (95.6%) were available for analysis. Of

kinetic chain resistance training on anterior knee laxity and function in the 
ACL-injured (ACLI) knee.
METHODS: Fifty-eight ACLI subjects were randomised to one of three (12-week 
duration) training groups. The STAND group trained according to a standardised 
rehabilitation protocol. Subjects in the LOW and HIGH group trained as did the 
STAND group but with the addition of seated knee extensor open kinetic chain 
resistance training at loads of 2 sets of 20 repetition maximum (RM) and 20 sets 
of 2RM, respectively. Anterior knee laxity and measurements of physical and 
subjective function were performed at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks. Thirty-six 
subjects were tested at both baseline and 12 weeks (STAND n = 13, LOW n = 11, 
HIGH n = 12).
RESULTS: The LOW group demonstrated a reduction in 133 N anterior knee laxity 
between baseline and 12 weeks testing when compared to the HIGH and the STAND 
groups (p = 0.009). Specifically, the trained-untrained knee laxity decreased an 
average of approximately 5 mm in the LOW group while remaining the same in the 
other two groups.
CONCLUSION: Twelve weeks of knee extensor open kinetic chain resistance training 
at loads of 2 sets of 20RM led to a reduction in anterior knee laxity in the 
ACLI knee. This reduction in laxity does not appear to offer any significant 
short-term functional advantages when compared to a standard rehabilitation

METHODS: Ninety patients undergoing primary TKA were involved and randomly 
allocated to the TENS or control group. In the TENS group, electrical 
stimulation of the common fibular nerve, which produced a brisk dorsiflexion of 
the ankle, was performed for the operated leg during surgery. In the control

RESULTS: The incidence of DVT was 11% (5/45 cases) in the TENS group and 31% (14/45 cases) in the control group (p = 0.02). Immediately after surgery, D-dimer and SFMC levels were lower in the TENS group compared with control (p < 0.05). There were no adverse effects related to TENS.

develop during total joint arthroplasty. Previously, we reported effective

navigation enables intraoperative control of leg length equalization and offset 
reconstruction. However, the effect of navigation compared with intraoperative 
fluoroscopy is unclear.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether intraoperative use of imageless navigation 
(1) improves the relative accuracy of leg length and global and femoral offset 
restoration; (2) increases the absolute precision of leg length and global and 
femoral offset equalization; and (3) reduces outliers in a reconstruction zone 
of В± 5 mm for leg length and global and femoral offset restoration compared with 
intraoperative fluoroscopy during minimally invasive (MIS) THA with the patient 
in a lateral decubitus position.
METHODS: In this prospective study a consecutive series of 125 patients were 
randomized to either navigation-guided or fluoroscopy-controlled THA using 
sealed, opaque envelopes. All patients received the same cementless prosthetic 
components through an anterolateral MIS approach while they were in a lateral 
decubitus position. Leg length, global or total offset (representing the 
combination of femoral and acetabular offset), and femoral offset differences 
were restored using either navigation or fluoroscopy. Postoperatively, residual 
leg length and global and femoral offset discrepancies were analyzed on 
magnification-corrected radiographs of the pelvis by an independent and blinded 
examiner using digital planning software. Accuracy was defined as the relative 
postoperative difference between the surgically treated and the unaffected 
contralateral side for leg length and offset, respectively; precision was 
defined as the absolute postoperative deviation of leg length and global and 
femoral offset regardless of lengthening or shortening of leg length and offset 
throughout the THA. All analyses were performed per intention-to-treat.
RESULTS: Analyzing the relative accuracy of leg length restoration we found a 
mean difference of 0.2 mm (95% CI, -1.0 to +1.4 mm; p = 0.729) between 
fluoroscopy and navigation, 0.2 mm (95 % CI, -0.9 to +1.3 mm; p = 0.740) for 
global offset and 1.7 mm (95 % CI, +0.4 to +2.9 mm; p = 0.008) for femoral

equalization, there was a mean difference of 1.7 В± 0.3 mm (p < 0.001) between 
fluoroscopy and navigation. The biomechanical reconstruction with a residual leg

antivenom for latrodectism, 224 patients (>7 years) with a redback spider bite 
and severe pain, with or without systemic effects, were randomized to receive 
normal saline solution (placebo) or antivenom after receiving standardized 
analgesia. The primary outcome was a clinically significant reduction in pain 2 
hours after trial medication compared with baseline. A second primary outcome 
was resolution of systemic features at 2 hours. Secondary outcomes were improved pain at 4 and 24 
hours, resolution of systemic features at 4 hours, administration of opioid 
analgesics or unblinded antivenom after 2 hours, and adverse reactions.
RESULTS: Two hours after treatment, 26 of 112 patients (23%) from the placebo 
arm had a clinically significant improvement in pain versus 38 of 112 (34%) from 
the antivenom arm (difference in favor of antivenom 10.7%; 95% confidence 
interval -1.1% to 22.6%; P=.10). Systemic effects resolved after 2 hours in 9 of 
41 patients (22%) in the placebo arm and 9 of 35 (26%) in the antivenom arm 
(difference 3.8%; 95% confidence interval -15% to 23%; P=.79). There was no 
significant difference in any secondary outcome between antivenom and placebo. 
Acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 4 of 112 patients (3.6%) 
receiving antivenom.

Intravenous morphine has been used as a common method of pain control in emergency care. NebulizedВ fentanylВ is also an effective temporary substitute. This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of nebulized fentanyl with intravenous (IV) morphine on management of acute limb pain.
Methods
This was a placebo-controlled, double-blindВ randomized clinical trial. Ninety emergency department patients with moderate to severe pain aged 15 to 50 years were blocked randomized and enrolled in this study. Forty-seven patients in the experimental group received nebulized fentanyl (4В Ојg/kg) and IV normal saline as placebo, and the remaining 43 patients in the control group received IV morphine (0.1 mg/kg) and nebulized normal saline as placebo.

in subjects undergoing assessment for acute angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitor-induced angioedema (ACEIA) in an emergency department (ED).
METHODS: This was a multicenter, phase 2, double-blind study with subjects 
randomized to receive a single subcutaneous dose of ecallantide (10, 30, or 60 
mg) or placebo plus physician-directed conventional therapy. The primary 
endpoint was defined as meeting predetermined discharge eligibility criteria 
within 6 hours of study drug administration. Discharge criteria included 
improvement of edema, stable vital signs, absence of stridor, absence of dyspnea 
or use of accessory muscles during respiration, absence of drooling, and ability 
to drink without difficulty.
RESULTS: An interim analysis showed that a high percentage of subjects met the 
primary endpoint, and the study was halted. Overall, 79 subjects were randomized 
and 76 had data for analysis. Most had mild (45%) or moderate (42%) ACEIA. The 
discharge eligibility endpoint was met by 72% of the placebo group and 85%, 89%, 
and 89% of the ecallantide 10-, 30-, and 60-mg groups, respectively. This 
difference in meeting discharge eligibility endpoint criteria between treatment 
groups was not statistically significant. The incidence of treatment-emergent 
adverse events was similar between placebo and active-treatment groups.
CONCLUSION: The addition of ecallantide to standard therapy does not appear to 
improve angioedema compared with placebo in ED patients with ACEIA. Our data 
suggest that most ED patients presenting with mild to moderate ACEIA are likely 
to meet our discharge eligibility criteria within 6 hours of treatment,

in subjects undergoing assessment for acute angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitor-induced angioedema (ACEIA) in an emergency department (ED).
METHODS: This was a multicenter, phase 2, double-blind study with subjects 
randomized to receive a single subcutaneous dose of ecallantide (10, 30, or 60 
mg) or placebo plus physician-directed conventional therapy. The primary 
endpoint was defined as meeting predetermined discharge eligibility criteria 
within 6 hours of study drug administration. Discharge criteria included 
improvement of edema, stable vital signs, absence of stridor, absence of dyspnea 
or use of accessory muscles during respiration, absence of drooling, and ability 
to drink without difficulty.
RESULTS: An interim analysis showed that a high percentage of subjects met the 
primary endpoint, and the study was halted. Overall, 79 subjects were randomized 
and 76 had data for analysis. Most had mild (45%) or moderate (42%) ACEIA. The 
discharge eligibility endpoint was met by 72% of the placebo group and 85%, 89%, 
and 89% of the ecallantide 10-, 30-, and 60-mg groups, respectively. This 
difference in meeting discharge eligibility endpoint criteria between treatment 
groups was not statistically significant. The incidence of treatment-emergent 
adverse events was similar between placebo and active-treatment groups.

glenohumeral offset (LGHO), and clinical results were compared for the Copeland 
(Biomet Inc, Warsaw, IN, USA) and the Global C.A.P. (DePuy Int, Warsaw, IN, USA) 
humeral head resurfacing implants (HHRIs).
METHODS: The study randomly allocated 32 patients (13 women), mean age 63 years 
(range, 39-82 years), with shoulder osteoarthritis to a Copeland (n = 14) or 
Global C.A.P. (n = 18) HHRI. Patients were monitored for 2 years with 
radiostereometry, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, Constant Shoulder Score 
(CSS), and the Western Ontario Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder Index (WOOS). LGHO 
was measured preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively.
RESULTS: At 2 years, total translation (TT) was 0.48 mm (standard deviation 
[SD], 0.21 mm) for the Copeland and 0.82 mm (SD, 0.46 mm) for the Global C.A.P.

(revision or 2 years), TT of 0.58 mm (SD, 0.61 mm) for revised HHRI was higher 
(P = .02) than TT of 0.22 mm (SD, 0.17 mm) in nonrevised HHRI. A comparison of 
TT at the last follow-up (revision or 2 years) found no difference between the 
HHRIs (P = .12). Periprosthetic BMD decreased initially but increased

203,25220196,Evaluation of periprosthetic bone mineral density and postoperative migration of humeral head resurfacing implants: two-year results of a randomized controlled clinical trial.,Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery,,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Implant migration, bone mineral density (BMD), length of 
glenohumeral offset (LGHO), and clinical results were compared for the Copeland 
(Biomet Inc, Warsaw, IN, USA) and the Global C.A.P. (DePuy Int, Warsaw, IN, USA) 
humeral head resurfacing implants (HHRIs).
METHODS: The study randomly allocated 32 patients (13 women), mean age 63 years 
(range, 39-82 years), with shoulder osteoarthritis to a Copeland (n = 14) or 
Global C.A.P. (n = 18) HHRI. The primary outcome was implant migration measured 
by total translation (TT). Secondary outcomes included bone mineral density, 
length of glenohumeral offset, Constant Shoulder Score (CSS), and the Western 
Ontario Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder Index (WOOS). Patients were monitored for 
2 years with radiostereometry, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, CSS, and WOOS. 
LGHO was measured preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively.
RESULTS: At 2 years, total translation (TT) was 0.48 mm (standard deviation 
[SD], 0.21 mm) for the Copeland and 0.82 mm (SD, 0.46 mm) for the Global C.A.P. 
(P = .06). Five HHRI were revised. Periprosthetic BMD decreased initially but 
increased continuously after 6 months for both HHRIs. At 2 years, BMD was 48% 
higher around the Copeland HHRI (P = .005). The mean difference in LGHO was 
significantly higher for the Copeland than for the Global C.A.P. HHRI (P = .02). 
Clinical results evaluated with CSS and WOOS improved over time for both implant 
groups (P < .01), with no differences between the groups.
CONCLUSION: The Copeland HHRI was not more effective than the Global C.A.P. HHRI 
on implant migration in patients with shoulder osteoarthritis.",spin,4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.8543074131011963, 'probability': 0.4255778193473816}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00020811776630580425, 'probability': 0.9997918605804443}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.8710730075836182, 'probability': 0.4185022711753845}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0003121604095213115, 'probability': 0.9996878504753113}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.7724864482879639, 'probability': 0.461863249540329}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0002849888114724308, 'probability': 0.9997149705886841}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.282299518585205, 'probability': 0.2773987054824829}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0008648469229228795, 'probability': 0.999135434627533}]",4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.9218931198120117, 'probability': 0.39776527881622314}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0004059444472659379, 'probability': 0.9995941519737244}]"

METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, eligible 
subjects presented to the ED with an asthma exacerbation, had partial response

METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial

anterior or global-based headache. This study was completed in 2 large academic 
EDs. Bupivacaine or normal saline solution was delivered intranasally (0.3 mL

minutes by a 100-mm visual analog scale. The primary endpoint was a 50% 
reduction in pain at 15 minutes. Telephone follow-up assessed 24-hour pain and 
nausea through a 0- to 10-point verbal scale and adverse effects.
RESULTS: The median reported baseline pain in the bupivacaine group was 80 mm

the rotator cuff (RC) tear has not been well clarified.
PURPOSE: To compare the clinical results between patients who had distal 
clavicle resection (DCR) and those who did not during RC repair.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: From August 2008 to December 2009, a total of 56 consecutive patients 
(58 shoulders) were included. All patients had either a full-thickness or 
high-grade (>50%) RC tear, ACJ tenderness, arthritic change visible on plain 
radiographs, and a positive ACJ lidocaine injection test the day before surgery. 
Patients were randomized into 2 groups: DCR and RC repair (DCR+RCR group) and RC 
repair only (isolated RCR). Evaluation was performed preoperatively, at 6 months 
postoperatively, and at a final follow-up a minimum of 24 months postoperatively 
using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, the Constant 
shoulder score, range of motion examination, and pain visual analog scale (VAS).
RESULTS: After simple randomization, 26 shoulders were allocated in the DCR+RCR 
group, and 32 were placed in the isolated RCR group. Five shoulders in the 
DCR+RCR group and 6 in the isolated RCR group were excluded from analysis due to 
loss of follow-up. Therefore, the evaluation was performed for 21 shoulders in 
the DCR+RCR group and 26 shoulders in the isolated RCR group. The mean follow-up 
period was 44.2 months in the DCR+RCR group and 44.0 months in the isolated RCR 
group. There were no differences in age, sex, symptom duration, RC tear size, or 
preoperative ASES, Constant, and VAS scores between the 2 groups (P > .05). At 
final follow-up, the ASES, Constant, and VAS scores were significantly improved

difference in residual ACJ tenderness (7 in the DCR+RCR group and 5 in the 
isolated RCR group) between the 2 groups (P = .270).
CONCLUSION: There was no difference in the clinical evaluations between the

Methods: We performed an institutional review board-approved, randomized, prospective, double-blinded trial at a tertiary, level 1 trauma center. A convenience sample of patients aged 18 to 59 years with acute abdominal, flank, low back, or extremity pain were enrolled.

Despite the 1:1:1 group receiving more plasma (median of 7 U vs 5 U, P < .001) and platelets (12 U vs 6 U, P < .001) and similar amounts of red blood cells (9 U) over the first 24 hours, no differences between the 2 groups were found for the 23 prespecified complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure, venous thromboembolism, sepsis, and transfusion-related complications.

Conclusions and relevance: Among patients with severe trauma and major bleeding, early administration of plasma, platelets, and red blood cells in a 1:1:1 ratio compared with a 1:1:2 ratio did not result in significant differences in mortality at 24 hours or at 30 days. However, more patients in the 1:1:1 group achieved hemostasis and fewer experienced death due to exsanguination by 24 hours. Even though there was an increased use of plasma and platelets transfused in the 1:1:1 group, no other safety differences were identified between the 2 groups.",no_spin,6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.9711901545524597, 'probability': 0.378632128238678}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00026556302327662706, 'probability': 0.9997344613075256}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.3639332056045532, 'probability': 0.6949375867843628}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0007064230740070343, 'probability': 0.9992938041687012}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.7375330924987793, 'probability': 0.4782923460006714}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00025674383505247533, 'probability': 0.9997432231903076}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.1741358041763306, 'probability': 0.3090859651565552}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0004769618099089712, 'probability': 0.9995231628417969}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.8471156358718872, 'probability': 0.42864954471588135}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0003541081096045673, 'probability': 0.9996459484100342}]"

Delayed initiation of neuroprotective agents has hindered earlier phase 3 trials of neuroprotective agents.

Methods: We randomly assigned patients with suspected stroke to receive either intravenous magnesium sulfate or placebo, beginning within 2 hours after symptom onset. A loading dose was initiated by paramedics before the patient arrived at the hospital, and a 24-hour maintenance infusion was started on the patient's arrival at the hospital.

To increase the likelihood that good alignment will be achieved during surgery, smart tools such as robotics or patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) have been introduced.
Questions/purposes:В We hypothesized that UKA performed with PSI would result in improved level gait as ascertained with three-dimensional analysis, implant positioning, and patient-reported outcomes measured by a validated scoring system when compared with conventional instrumentation 3 months and 1 year after surgery.
Methods:В We randomized 60 patients into two groups using either the PSI technique or a conventional technique. All patients were operated on using the same technique and the same cemented metal-backed implant. Mean age of the patients was 63 В± 4 years (range, 54-72 years) and mean body mass index was 28 В± 3 kg/m(2). Patients were evaluated preoperatively, at 3 months, and 1 year after surgery by an independent observer blind to the type of technique. Gait parameters were assessed with three-dimensional analysis during level walking preoperatively and at 1 year, frontal and sagittal position of the implant was evaluated on full-length radiographs at 3 months, and subjective functional outcome and quality of life using routine questionnaires (SF-12, new Knee Society Score [KSS], Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) at 3 months and 1 year. This study had 80% power to detect a 15% difference in walking speed at the p < 0.05 level.
Results:В One year after surgery, there were no differences between the two groups in the analyzed gait spatiotemporal parameters, respectively, for PSI UKA and conventional UKA : double limb support 31% (25%-54%) versus 30% (23%-56%; p = 0.67) and walking speed (1.59 m/s [0.86-1.87 m/s] versus 1.57 m/s [0.71-1.96 m/s]; p = 0.41). No difference was observed between the two groups in terms of lower limb alignment (PSI group 178В° В± 3В°, conventional group 178В° В± 4В°; p = 0.24) or implant positioning on mediolateral and anteroposterior radiographs. There were no differences in the functional score between the PSI and conventional TKA groups at 3 months and 1 year after surgery: KSS objective knee scores (PSI: 85 В± 8 points at 3 months, 87 В± 5 points at 1 year and conventional instrumentation: 82 В± 8 points at 3 months 83 В± 6 points at 1 year; p = 0.10) and functional activity scores were similar in both group (PSI: 71 В± 12 points at 3 months and 74 В± 7 points at 1 year versus conventional group: 73 В± 11 points at 3 months and 75 В± 6 at 1 year; p = 0.9).

defined. This trial was performed to assess the feasibility and safety of 
controlled resuscitation (CR) versus standard resuscitation (SR) in hypotensive 
trauma patients.
METHODS: Patients were enrolled and randomized in the out-of-hospital setting. 
Nineteen emergency medical services (EMS) systems in the Resuscitation Outcome 
Consortium participated. Eligible patients had an out-of-hospital systolic blood 
pressure (SBP) of 90 mm Hg or lower. CR patients received 250 mL of fluid if 
they had no radial pulse or an SBP lower than 70 mm Hg and additional 250-mL 
boluses to maintain a radial pulse or an SBP of 70 mm Hg or greater. The SR 
group patients received 2 L initially and additional fluid as needed to maintain 
an SBP of 110 mm Hg or greater. The crystalloid protocol was maintained until 
hemorrhage control or 2 hours after hospital arrival.
RESULTS: A total of 192 patients were randomized (97 CR and 95 SR). The CR and 
SR groups were similar at baseline. The mean (SD) crystalloid volume 
administered during the study period was 1.0 L (1.5) in the CR group and 2.0 L 
(1.4) in the SR group, a difference of 1.0 L (95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.6-1.4). Intensive care unit-free days, ventilator-free days, renal injury, and 
renal failure did not differ between the groups. At 24 hours after admission, 
there were 5 deaths (5%) in the CR group and 14 (15%) in the SR group (adjusted 
odds ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.12-1.26).

defined. This trial was performed to assess the feasibility and safety of 
controlled resuscitation (CR) versus standard resuscitation (SR) in hypotensive 
trauma patients.
METHODS: Patients were enrolled and randomized in the out-of-hospital setting. 
Nineteen emergency medical services (EMS) systems in the Resuscitation Outcome 
Consortium participated. Eligible patients had an out-of-hospital systolic blood 
pressure (SBP) of 90 mm Hg or lower. CR patients received 250 mL of fluid if 
they had no radial pulse or an SBP lower than 70 mm Hg and additional 250-mL 
boluses to maintain a radial pulse or an SBP of 70 mm Hg or greater. The SR 
group patients received 2 L initially and additional fluid as needed to maintain 
an SBP of 110 mm Hg or greater. The crystalloid protocol was maintained until 
hemorrhage control or 2 hours after hospital arrival.
RESULTS: A total of 192 patients were randomized (97 CR and 95 SR). The CR and 
SR groups were similar at baseline. The mean (SD) crystalloid volume 
administered during the study period was 1.0 L (1.5) in the CR group and 2.0 L 
(1.4) in the SR group, a difference of 1.0 L (95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.6-1.4). Intensive care unit-free days, ventilator-free days, renal injury, and 
renal failure did not differ between the groups. At 24 hours after admission, 
there were 5 deaths (5%) in the CR group and 14 (15%) in the SR group (adjusted 
odds ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.12-1.26). Among patients with blunt trauma, 24-hour 
mortality was 3% (CR) and 18% (SR) with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.17 
(0.03-0.92). There was no difference among patients with penetrating trauma (9% 
vs. 9%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.93; 95% CI, 0.19-19.17).

types of burns, and numerous dressing materials are available for their 
treatment. A multicenter, open, randomized, and parallel study was undertaken to 
determine the efficacy and tolerability of silver sulfadiazine (SSD) compared 
with an absorbent foam silver dressing, Mepilex Ag, on patients aged between 5 
years and 65 years with deep partial-thickness thermal burn injuries (2.5-25% 
total body surface area).
METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to either SSD (n = 82) applied daily or 
a Mepilex Ag dressing (n = 71) applied every 5 days to 7 days. The treatment 
period was up to 4 weeks.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups 
with respect to the primary end point of time to healing, which occurred in 56 
(79%) of 71 patients after a median follow-up time of 15 days in the Mepilex Ag 
group compared with 65 (79%) of 82 patients after a median follow-up time of 16 
days in the SSD group (p = 0.74). There was also no significant difference in 
the percentage of study burn healed. Patients in the Mepilex Ag group had 87.1% 
of their study burn healed (out of the total burn area) compared with 85.2% of 
patients in the SSD group. However, the mean total number of dressings used was 
significantly more in the SSD group (14.0) compared with the Mepilex Ag group 
(3.06, p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in the time until skin 
graft was performed between the two study groups.
CONCLUSION: There was no difference in healing rates between Mepilex Ag and SSD,

undisturbed healing and makes it easier for patients to continue with their

described a positive effect of lateralization of the center of rotation,

compare the outcome of non-lateralized versus lateralized RSA with particular 
regard to rotational function in patients with CTA.
METHODS: Thirty-four patients underwent implantation of RSA either with 
lateralization (nВ =В 17) or without lateralization (nВ =В 17) by use of a 1-cm 
autologous bone graft (""bony increased offset"") of the humeral head for CTA.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term results of primary ACL reconstruction using 
either an allograft or autograft.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: From June 2002 to August 2003, patients with a symptomatic 
ACL-deficient knee were randomized to receive either a hamstring autograft or 
tibialis posterior allograft. All allografts were from a single tissue bank, 
aseptically processed, and fresh-frozen without terminal irradiation. Graft 
fixation was identical in all knees. All patients followed the same 
postoperative rehabilitation protocol, which was blinded to the therapists. 
Preoperative and postoperative assessments were performed via examination and/or

METHODS: A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was 
conducted to investigate the effects of 5 minutes of 80-Hz vibration applied

performed as outpatient surgeries, patients can still experience significant 
postoperative pain and opioid-associated side effects.
PURPOSE: The potential benefits of a preoperative femoral nerve block (FNB) in 
hip arthroscopy were explored in a previous retrospective review. The study 
objective was to confirm these findings in a prospective randomized study.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: Fifty patients undergoing hip arthroscopy were included in this 
prospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial that was patient-, 
operator-, and assessor-blinded. Patients received either a preoperative 
ultrasound-guided FNB with 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine (FNB group) or normal 
saline (control group). Nerve blockade was confirmed via standardized sensory 
testing before the induction of general anesthesia. The primary endpoint was 
cumulative consumption of oral morphine equivalent at 24 hours after discharge. 
Secondary endpoints included opioid use at various time points, pain scores, 
Quality of Recovery (QoR-27) score, incidence of nausea and vomiting, time to 
discharge, block-related complications, falls at 24 hours, and patient 
satisfaction.
RESULTS: Fifty patients completed the study, including 27 in the FNB group and 
23 in the control group. Most patient characteristics were statistically similar 
between groups except for operative time, which was longer in the control group. 
Cumulative oral morphine consumption was lower in the FNB group at 48 hours; 
there was no difference at 24 hours or 7 days postoperatively. Pain scores were 
significantly lower up to 6 hours postoperatively in the FNB group compared with 
control; however, rebound pain was observed at 24 hours after discharge in 
patients who received FNB. There was no difference in most secondary outcomes. 
Importantly, a total of 6 patients in the FNB group reported falls (without 
injury) within the first 24 hours postoperatively compared with none in the 
control group. Patient satisfaction with pain control was high in both groups at

receiving therapeutic hypothermia (TH) after cardiac arrest. However, incidence 
of mortality and morbidity remains high in this patient group. Rapid targeted

efficacy of Rhinochill, an intranasal cooling device over Blanketrol, a surface 
cooling device in inducing TH in cardiac arrest patients within the cardiac 
catheter laboratory.
METHODS: 70 patients were randomized to TH induction with either Rhinochill or 
Blanketrol. Primary outcome measures were time to reach tympanic в‰¤34 В°C from

receiving therapeutic hypothermia (TH) after cardiac arrest. However, incidence

investigates the efficacy of Rhinochill, an intranasal cooling device over

within the cardiac catheter laboratory.
METHODS: 70 patients were randomized to TH induction with either Rhinochill or 
Blanketrol. Primary outcome measures were time to reach tympanic ≤34 °C from 
randomisation as a surrogate for brain temperature and oesophageal ≤34 °C from 
randomisation as a measurement of core body temperature. Secondary outcomes

However, there are few well-designed studies comparing approaches to treatment.

Questions/purposes: (1) Which treatment (compression bandaging with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], aspiration, or aspiration with steroid injections) is associated with the highest likelihood of resolution of nonseptic olecranon bursitis? (2) Which treatment is associated with earliest resolution of symptoms? (3) What factors are associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks?

Methods: We enrolled 133 patients from two centers; after applying prespecified exclusions (septic bursitis or concomitant inflammatory arthritis, intraarticular elbow pathology, recent aspiration or steroid injection done elsewhere, and refusal to participate), 90 patients were randomly allocated to receive compression bandaging with NSAIDs (C), aspiration (A), or aspiration with steroid injection (AS) groups (30 patients in each). The groups were similar at baseline in terms of age and gender. Seven patients (four from Group A and three from Group AS) were lost to followup. All patients were followed up weekly for 4 weeks, and the same treatment procedure was repeated if the bursitis recurred with any substantial fluid collection. At 4 weeks, the state of resolution and pain visual analog scale (VAS) were evaluated. Failed resolution was defined as presence of persistent olecranon bursal fluid collection at Week 4 after the initiation of the treatment; on the contrary, if bursal fluid collection was clinically reduced or completely disappeared by the end of Week 4, the treatment was considered successful. We compared the proportion of resolution by Week 4 and the median times to resolution among the treatment groups. In addition, we evaluated whether the resolution affected pain VAS and what factors were associated with the resolution.

Results: There were no differences in the proportion of patients whose bursitis resolved by Week 4 among the three treatment groups (Group C: 25 of 30 [83%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.27-1.72], p = 0.580; Group A: 17 of 26 [65%], relative risk of resolution failure: 2.19 [95% CI, 0.98-4.87], p = 0.083; Group AS: 23 of 27 [85%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.59 [95% CI, 0.22-1.63], p = 0.398) (p = 0.073). Steroid injection after aspiration (Group AS) was associated with the earliest resolution (2.3 weeks [range, 1-4 weeks]) when compared with aspiration alone (Group A; 3.1 weeks [range, 2-4 weeks]) and compression bandaging with NSAIDs (Group C; 3.2 weeks [range, 2-4 weeks]), p = 0.015). Longer duration of symptoms before treatment was the only factor associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks (failed resolution: 6 weeks [range, 2-9 weeks]; successful resolution: 4 weeks [range, 0.4-6 weeks]; p = 0.008).

Conclusions: With the numbers available, there were no differences in efficacy when compression bandaging with NSAIDs, aspiration, and aspiration with steroid injection were compared. However, we were powered only to detect a 30% difference, meaning that if there were a smaller difference in efficacy among the groups, we might not have detected it in a study of this size. Our data can be used as pilot data to power future prospective (and likely multicenter) trials. Because olecranon bursitis can recur, and because treatments like aspiration and aspiration with steroid injection can cause complications, unless future trials demonstrate clear efficacy advantages of aspiration and/or injection both at short and longer terms, we suggest that compression bandaging and a short course of NSAIDs may offer the most appropriate balance of safety and efficacy.",no_spin,6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.0529778003692627, 'probability': 0.3488972783088684}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00040749352774582803, 'probability': 0.999592661857605}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.5779225826263428, 'probability': 0.561062753200531}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0018685277318581939, 'probability': 0.9981332421302795}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.7596991658210754, 'probability': 0.4678071439266205}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0006906984490342438, 'probability': 0.9993095397949219}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -1.3189224004745483, 'probability': 0.2674233317375183}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.005554717034101486, 'probability': 0.9944607019424438}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.2335506677627563, 'probability': 0.2912565767765045}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00257862638682127, 'probability': 0.9974247217178345}]"

Our hypothesis was that there would be no differences in joint line angles or correction accuracy between the two groups, that patellar height would increase after CW HTO and decrease after OW HTO, and that leg length and posterior tibial slope would decrease after CW HTO and increase after OW HTO.

Methods: Radiological data were collected from 70 patients participating in an ongoing prospective randomized clinical trial comparing OW and CW HTOs. Digital standing hip-knee-ankle (HKA) radiographs as well as lateral radiographs in 30Ў of flexion were obtained preoperatively and at 6 months for each patient. Joint line angles, HKA angle, leg length, Insall-Salvati index, Miura-Kawamura index and posterior tibial slope were measured using medical planning software. The complete preoperative radiological examinations of the first 50 patients were used in a study of intra- and inter-rater reliability of the measurements.

Results: The mean posterior slope was reduced by 2.5Ў in CW HTO, whereas it remained unchanged in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Mean leg length decreased 5.7 mm in CW HTO and increased 3.1 mm in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Changes in joint line angles, patellar height indexes and the correction accuracy showed no significant differences comparing the two techniques. Frontal plane reliability measurement intra- and inter-rater intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) varied from 0.81 to 0.99. Sagittal plane intra- and inter-rater ICC varied from 0.60 to 0.87. Posterior tibial slope intra- and inter-rater ICC showed the lowest values (0.70 and 0.60, respectively) corresponding to a smallest real difference of 4.5Ў and 5.5Ў, respectively.

Conclusions: Posterior tibial slope and leg length changes were significantly different in CW compared to OW HTOs.

METHODS: In this open-label randomized controlled trial, 122 adult patients with 
sepsis and serum lactate concentration of greater than or equal to 3.0 mmol/L 
were randomized to receive usual care or intravenous fluid bolus administration 
guided by measurements of change of stroke volume index, using the noninvasive 
cardiac output monitor after passive leg-raising maneuver. The primary outcome 
was lactate clearance of more than 20% at 3 hours. Secondary outcomes included 
mortality, length of hospital and ICU stay, and total hospital cost. Analysis 
was intention to treat.
RESULTS: Similar proportions of patients in the randomized intervention group 
(70.5%; N=61) versus control group (73.8%; N=61) achieved the primary outcome, 
with a relative risk of 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77 to 1.19). 
Secondary outcomes were similar in both groups (P>.05 for all comparisons). 
Hospital mortality occurred in 6 patients (9.8%) each in the intervention and 
control groups on or before 28 days (relative risk=1.00; 95% CI 0.34 to 2.93).

maneuver has been shown to be reasonably accurate in predicting fluid 
responsiveness in critically ill patients. We examine whether using a 
noninvasive protocol would result in more rapid lactate clearance after 3 hours 
in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock in the emergency department.
METHODS: In this open-label randomized controlled trial, 122 adult patients with 
sepsis and serum lactate concentration of greater than or equal to 3.0 mmol/L 
were randomized to receive usual care or intravenous fluid bolus administration 
guided by measurements of change of stroke volume index, using the noninvasive 
cardiac output monitor after passiveВ leg-raising maneuver. The primary outcome 
was lactate clearance of more than 20% at 3 hours. Secondary outcomes included 
mortality, length of hospital and ICU stay, and total hospital cost. Analysis 
was intention to treat.
RESULTS: Similar proportions of patients in the randomized intervention group 
(70.5%; N=61) versus control group (73.8%; N=61) achieved the primary outcome, 
with a relative risk of 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77 to 1.19). 
Secondary outcomes were similar in both groups (P>.05 for all comparisons). 
Hospital mortality occurred in 6 patients (9.8%) each in the intervention and 
control groups on or before 28 days (relative risk=1.00; 95% CI 0.34 to 2.93). 
Among a subgroup of patients with underlying fluid overload states, those in the 
intervention group tended to receive clinically significantly more intravenous 
fluids at 3 hours (difference=975 mL; 95% CI -450 to 1,725 mL) and attained 
better lactate clearance (difference=19.7%; 95% CI -34.6% to 60.2%) compared 
with the control group, with shorter hospital lengths of stay (difference=-4.5 
days; 95% CI -9.5 to 2.5 days).
CONCLUSION: Protocol-based fluid resuscitation of patients with severe sepsis

Objective: To test the hypothesis that high-intensity endurance training (ET) is superior to moderate-intensity ET for improving risk factors for type 2 diabetes in overweight adolescents.

Design and methods: In this randomized trial, 106 overweight and obese adolescents (15.2 years; 76% female; 62% Caucasian) were randomly assigned to high-intensity ET (70-85% of heart rate reserve, n=38), moderate-intensity ET (40-55% heart rate reserve; n=32) or control for 6 months (n=36).

151,26730451,A Randomized Trial Comparing Ceramic-on-Ceramic Bearing vs Ceramic-on-Crossfire-Polyethylene Bearing Surfaces in Total Hip Arthroplasty.,The Journal of Arthroplasty,,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Bearing surfaces in total hip arthroplasty (THA) may affect implant 
longevity and hence patient outcomes. This randomized clinical trial determined 
how ceramic-on-ceramic (CERAMIC) bearing THA affected joint-specific pain, 
function, and stiffness and prosthesis fixation/longevity over 10 postoperative 
years compared with ceramic-on-highly-crosslinked-polyethylene (POLYETHYLENE) 
bearing THA. This is a follow-up to previously reported 5-year outcomes.
METHODS: Subjects aged <61 years were randomized to CERAMIC (n = 48) or 
POLYETHYLENE (n = 44) THA. The primary outcome was joint-specific pain, 
function, and stiffness assessed using the Western Ontario McMaster 
Osteoarthritis Index. Secondary outcomes included the RAND 12-Item Health Survey. 
Subjects were assessed preoperatively, and at 1, 5, and 10 years postoperatively. 
Plain radiographs were evaluated at 10 years for fixation, and medical records 
were reviewed for revisions.
RESULTS: Of 92 subjects, 6 (7%) died within 10 years; 68 (79%) survivors 
provided radiographic and/or clinical follow-up at 10 years postoperatively. 
There were no group differences in the Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis 
Index at 10 years (P > .48). There were no group differences in the RAND 12-Item 
Health Survey at 10 years (P > .48). There were no failures or loss of fixation 
related to bearing surfaces/wear in either group. Over 10 years, 3 subjects in 
the POLYETHYLENE group had revisions that were related to recurrent dislocation; 
2 revisions were performed within 2 years of surgery, and one further subject

longevity and hence patient outcomes. This randomized clinical trial determined 
how ceramic-on-ceramic (CERAMIC) bearing THA affected joint-specific pain, 
function, and stiffness and prosthesis fixation/longevity over 10 postoperative 
years compared with ceramic-on-highly-crosslinked-polyethylene (POLYETHYLENE) 
bearing THA. This is a follow-up to previously reported 5-year outcomes.
METHODS: Subjects aged <61 years were randomized to CERAMIC (nВ = 48) or 
POLYETHYLENE (nВ = 44) THA. Subjects were assessed using the Western Ontario 
McMaster Osteoarthritis Index and the RAND 12-Item Health Survey preoperatively, 
and at 1, 5, and 10 years postoperatively. Plain radiographs were evaluated at 
10 years for fixation, and medical records were reviewed for revisions.
RESULTS: Of 92 subjects, 6 (7%) died within 10 years; 68 (79%) survivors 
provided radiographic and/or clinical follow-up at 10 years postoperatively. 
Improvements seen at 5 years in both the Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis 
Index and RAND 12-Item Health Survey were retained at 10 years with no group 
differences (P > .48). There were no failures or loss of fixation related to 
bearing surfaces/wear in either group. Over 10 years, 3 subjects in the 
POLYETHYLENE group had revisions that were related to recurrent dislocation; 2 
revisions were performed within 2 years of surgery, and one further subject 
underwent revision at 7 years postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first randomized clinical trials to examine

(RC) repair has been proposed for patients at risk of postoperative stiffness.
PURPOSE: To investigate, in patients undergoing early accelerated mobilization, 
whether double-row (DR) repair provides better clinical outcomes and a lower 
retear rate compared with single-row (SR) configurations.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: A total of 58 patients were randomized to undergo either SR or DR 
repair. After 2 years of follow-up, 12 men and 13 women (mean age, 61.8 years; 
range, 52-67 years) in the SR group and 15 men and 10 women (mean age, 58.9 
years; range, 51-69 years) in the DR group were evaluated. To assess the retear 
rate, magnetic resonance imaging of the shoulder was performed at 2-year 
follow-up. The clinical evaluation was based on the modified University of 
California, Los Angeles (UCLA) shoulder score and range of motion (ROM) 
measurements.
RESULTS: Magnetic resonance arthrography showed a significantly lower 
full-thickness retear rate for the DR group than for the SR group (8% vs 24%, 
respectively; P < .05). At both 6-month and 2-year follow-up, there 
was no statistically significant difference in terms of the rate of stiffness in 
the SR and DR groups (8% vs 12% and 0% vs 0%, respectively; P > .05). No

186,26797698,Double-Row Repair Lowers the Retear Risk After Accelerated Rehabilitation.,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,  Focus on (+) secondary endpoint,Claim benefit based on (+) secondary endpoint,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Recently, an accelerated rehabilitation protocol after rotator cuff 
(RC) repair has been proposed for patients at risk of postoperative stiffness.
PURPOSE: To investigate, in patients undergoing early accelerated mobilization, 
whether double-row (DR) repair provides better clinical outcomes and a lower 
retear rate compared with single-row (SR) configurations.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: A total of 58 patients were randomized to undergo either SR or DR 
repair. After 2 years of follow-up, 12 men and 13 women (mean age, 61.8 years; 
range, 52-67 years) in the SR group and 15 men and 10 women (mean age, 58.9 
years; range, 51-69 years) in the DR group were evaluated. To assess the retear 
rate, magnetic resonance imaging of the shoulder was performed at 2-year 
follow-up. The clinical evaluation was based on the modified University of 
California, Los Angeles (UCLA) shoulder score and range of motion (ROM) 
measurements.
RESULTS: Magnetic resonance arthrography showed a significantly lower 
full-thickness retear rate for the DR group than for the SR group (8% vs 24%, 
respectively; P < .05). Conversely, at both 6-month and 2-year follow-up, there 
was no statistically significant difference in terms of the rate of stiffness in 
the SR and DR groups (8% vs 12% and 0% vs 0%, respectively; P > .05). No 
clinical differences were recorded regarding the UCLA score (SR group: mean, 
32.6 [range, 30-35]; DR group: mean, 33.3 [range, 29-35]; P = .61) and ROM.
CONCLUSION: In selected patients at a high risk of shoulder stiffness and 
therefore necessitating accelerated postoperative rehabilitation, DR repair of 
the RC could lower retear rates.",no_spin,6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.8774451017379761, 'probability': 0.4158439636230469}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00018904806347563863, 'probability': 0.9998109340667725}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.38604387640953064, 'probability': 0.6797407269477844}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0002967870968859643, 'probability': 0.9997032284736633}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.0606025457382202, 'probability': 0.346247136592865}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00015341058315243572, 'probability': 0.9998465776443481}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.8265578150749207, 'probability': 0.4375528395175934}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00010609064338495955, 'probability': 0.9998939037322998}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -1.030824065208435, 'probability': 0.35671287775039673}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00013851160474587232, 'probability': 0.999861478805542}]"

Methods: Thirty-eight patients undergoing TKA were randomly assigned to receive either a periarticular injection (PAI) with LB (n = 20) or with a standard PAI (including a combination of ropivacaine, clonidine, Toradol, Epinepherine, and saline; n = 18) as part of a multimodal pain management approach.

METHODS: One hundred twenty patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff 
repair with SLBC lesions (biceps partial tears <50%, partial pulley lesions, and 
type II SLAP lesions) were enrolled in this prospective comparative study and 
randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups (simple debridement [Deb], biceps

Results: Estimated effects comparing the mindfulness to control arm favored the mindfulness arm in (a) weight loss at 12 months, -1.9 kg (95% CI: -4.5, 0.8; P = 0.17), and 18 months, -1.7 kg (95% CI: -4.7, 1.2; P = 0.24), though not statistically significant; (b) changes in fasting glucose at 12 months, -3.1 mg/dl (95% CI: -6.3, 0.1; P = 0.06), and 18 months, -4.1 mg/dl (95% CI: -7.3, -0.9; P = 0.01); and (c) changes in triglyceride/HDL ratio at 12 months, -0.57 (95% CI: -0.95, -0.18; P = 0.004), and 18 months, -0.36 (95% CI: -0.74, 0.03; P = 0.07). Estimates for other metabolic risk factors were not statistically significant, including waist circumference, blood pressure, and C-reactive protein.

Conclusions: Mindfulness enhancements to a diet-exercise program did not show substantial weight loss benefit but may promote long-term improvement in some aspects of metabolic health in obesity that requires further study.",no_spin,6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.6343755125999451, 'probability': 0.530266523361206}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0004648081958293915, 'probability': 0.999535322189331}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.6006669402122498, 'probability': 0.5484457612037659}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.000503770774230361, 'probability': 0.999496340751648}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.8458632230758667, 'probability': 0.42918670177459717}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0005887205479666591, 'probability': 0.9994115233421326}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.9427676200866699, 'probability': 0.3895482122898102}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00039081089198589325, 'probability': 0.9996092915534973}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.779704213142395, 'probability': 0.4585416615009308}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0006026597693562508, 'probability': 0.9993975758552551}]"

Conclusions: Overall, neither amiodarone nor lidocaine resulted in a significantly higher rate of survival or favorable neurologic outcome than the rate with placebo among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.",no_spin,4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.5486913919448853, 'probability': 0.5777053236961365}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0001746263587847352, 'probability': 0.9998253583908081}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.29387399554252625, 'probability': 0.7453703284263611}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0004319211875554174, 'probability': 0.9995681643486023}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.990679919719696, 'probability': 0.3713241517543793}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00019560330838430673, 'probability': 0.9998043775558472}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.0800665616989136, 'probability': 0.3395729064941406}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0001879753835964948, 'probability': 0.9998120665550232}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.7511343955993652, 'probability': 0.47183099389076233}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0002416080387774855, 'probability': 0.9997583627700806}]"

The aim of this study was to determine whether there are middle-term differences in knee function and pain in patients undergoing fixed- and mobile-bearing total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

Methods: Eligible patients were randomized into two groups: the first group received TKA implantation with a fixed tibial platform (group A); the second group received TKA with a mobile tibial platform (group B). Patients were followed up (2 years), and their symptoms and limitations in daily living activities were evaluated using the Knee Outcome Survey-Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADLS), in addition to pain evaluation assessed using the pain visual analogue scale (VAS).

Results: There were no significant differences in function and symptoms in the ADLS and VAS between the study groups.

Conclusion: The type of platform used in TKA (fixed vs. mobile) does not change the symptoms, function or pain of patients 2 years post-surgery.

established as a standard treatment for large full-thickness cartilage defects, 
the effect of different doses of autologous chondrocyte products on structural 
outcomes has never been examined.
HYPOTHESIS: In ACI, the dose level may have an influence on medium-term magnetic 
resonance morphological findings after treatment.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: A total of 75 patients who underwent ACI using a pure, autologous, 
third-generation matrix-associated ACI product were divided into 3 groups 
representing different doses: 3 to 7 spheroids/cm(2), 10 to 30 spheroids/cm(2), 
and 40 to 70 spheroids/cm(2). Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 1.5, 
3, 6, and 12 months after ACI and was evaluated by the magnetic resonance 
observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score and the Knee injury and 
Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS).
RESULTS: MOCART scores showed improvements after 3 months, with slight dose 
dependence, and further improvement after 12 months, although without 
significant dose dependence. The mean MOCART scores after 3 months (0 = worst, 
100 = best) were 59.8, 64.5, and 64.7 for the low-, medium-, and high-dose 
groups, respectively, and 62.9 for all patients; at 12 months, these were 74.1, 
74.5, and 68.8 for the respective dose groups and 72.4 for all patients. Several 
MOCART items (surface of repair tissue, structure of repair tissue, signal 
intensity of repair tissue, subchondral bone, and synovitis) showed a more rapid 
response with the medium and high doses than with the low dose, suggesting a 
potential dose relationship. No significant correlation between the MOCART 
(overall and subscores) with clinical outcomes as assessed by the overall KOOS 
was detected at 3- and 12-month assessments.
CONCLUSION: This study reveals a trend toward earlier recovery after treatment 
with higher spheroid doses in terms of better defect filling for full-thickness 
cartilage defects of the knee, while outcomes after 12 months were similar in 
all dose groups. However, a correlation with clinical outcomes or the failure 
rate at 1 year after ACI was not found. A longer follow-up will be required for 
more definite conclusions on the clinical relevance of ACI cell density to be 
drawn.

This study compared the outcomes of tenotomy with outcomes of tenodesis for treatment of LHBT lesions with rotator cuff tears.

Methods: The study enrolled 128 patients with LHBT lesions and small- to medium-sized rotator cuff tear. Arthroscopic LHBT tenotomy was done in 56 patients (group I), and LHBT tenodesis was done for 72 patients (group II) with rotator cuff repair. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Score, simple shoulder test, pain visual analog scale, range of motion, and cosmetic changes were assessed initially, at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively, and the last visit. The elbow motor power and magnetic resonance imaging were evaluated at 12 months.

Results: Both groups showed improvement in functional scores after treatments, but no significant difference was found between the 2 groups at each assessment. The rate of Popeye deformity was 3 times higher in group I (P = .04). Group II showed greater forearm supination power than group I (P = .02).

patients is under debate.
PURPOSE: To compare clinical outcomes and calf muscle strength recovery after 
the nonsurgical treatment and open surgical repair of acute Achilles tendon 
ruptures with identical accelerated rehabilitation programs.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: From 2009 to 2013, a total of 60 patients with an acute Achilles tendon 
rupture were randomized to surgery or nonsurgical treatment. Nonsurgical 
treatment included first a week of cast immobilization, followed by a functional 
orthosis for 6 weeks, allowing full weightbearing after week 1 and active 
plantar flexion after week 5. Surgery was simple end-to-end open repair, and 
postoperative treatment was identical to nonsurgical treatment. The primary outcome 
was the Leppilahti Achilles tendon performance score. Secondary outcomes included 
isokinetic calf muscle strength and RAND 36-Item Health Survey at 18-month follow-up.
RESULTS: At 18-month follow-up, the mean Leppilahti score was 79.5 and 75.7 for 
the surgically and nonsurgically treated groups, respectively (mean difference, 
3.8; 95% CI, -1.9 to 9.5; P = .19). Angle-specific peak torque results of 
affected legs at 18 months showed a 14% difference in the peak torque of the 
affected leg favoring the surgical group versus the nonsurgical group (mean peak 
torque, 110.3 vs 96.5 N·m, respectively; mean difference, 13.6 N·m; 95% CI, 
2.0-25.1 N·m; P = .022). The RAND 36-Item Health Survey indicated differences 
in the domains of physical functioning (P = .006) and bodily pain (P = .037) 
for surgically treated patients.
CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment was not more effective than nonsurgical treatment 
on the Leppilahti Achilles tendon performance score in patients with acute 
Achilles tendon ruptures.

better results in the domains of physical functioning (P = .006) and bodily pain 
(P = .037) for surgically treated patients.
CONCLUSION: Surgical and nonsurgical treatments of acute Achilles tendon 
ruptures have similar results in terms of the Achilles tendon performance score, 
but surgery restores calf muscle strength earlier over the entire range of 
motion of the ankle joint, with a 10% to 18% strength difference favoring 
surgery at 18 months. Surgery may also result in better health-related quality 
of life in the domains of physical functioning and bodily pain compared with 
nonsurgical treatment.

There is still a need for a method of anesthesia that can deliver effective long-term postoperative pain relief without incurring the high cost and health burden of opioids and nerve blocks.

Questions/purposes: (1) Is liposomal bupivacaine-based periarticular injection (PAI) more effective than morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA? (2) Do patients treated with liposomal bupivacaine-based PAI experience fewer opioid-related adverse events compared with patients treated with morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA?

Methods: This multicenter, blind trial randomized 119 patients undergoing TKA with spinal anesthesia to receive spinal anesthesia plus periarticular injection with liposomal bupivacaine (40 patients), spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine plus intrathecal morphine (41 patients) but no liposomal bupivacaine injection, or spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine (38 patients) and no liposomal bupivacaine injection. The two groups that did not receive periarticular liposomal bupivacaine did receive periarticular injection with ropivacaine, and all three groups had ketorolac (30 mg) plus epinephrine (1:1000) in the periarticular injections. Patients in all three groups received identical perioperative multimodal analgesic and antiemetic drugs. All patients were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized and no patients were lost to followup. The primary study endpoints were visual analog score (VAS) for pain and narcotic use during postoperative day 1. Secondary endpoints included side effects associated with narcotic administration during the hospital stay.

Results: Mean VAS pain in the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group was lower than that for the ropivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (1.8 ± 2.1 versus 3.3 ± 2.3, p = 0.005, mean difference: 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-2.5) and 12 hours (1.5 ± 2.0 versus 3.3 ± 2.4, p < 0.001, mean difference: 1.8, 95% CI, 0.8-2.8) after surgery. The morphine spinal group had lower pain compared with the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (0.9 ± 1.8 versus 1.8 ± 2.1, p = 0.035, mean difference: 1.0, 95% CI, 0.1-1.8), but there was no difference at 12 hours (0.8 ± 1.5 versus 1.5 ± 2.0, p = 0.086, mean difference: 0.7, 95% CI, -0.1 to 1.5). The magnitude of the differences at 6 and 12 hours are near the lower end of minimal clinically important differences reported in the literature, and thus the improvement shown in this study may only represent a small clinical improvement. Both the liposomal bupivacaine group (13% [five of 40]) and the ropivacaine group (5% [two of 38]) had fewer incidents of itching (pruritus) than the spinal morphine group (38% [15 of 41]) (p = 0.001).

rare.
PURPOSE: To compare the clinical outcomes of arthroscopic anatomic DB ACLR with 
a hamstring tendon autograft versus irradiated allograft.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: Between 2008 and 2009, a total of 107 patients undergoing arthroscopic 
DB ACLR were prospectively randomized consecutively into 1 of 2 groups 
(autograft [Auto] group and irradiated allograft [Ir-Allo] group). All the 
surgical procedures were performed by the same senior surgeon using the DB 
reconstruction technique. All irradiated hamstring tendon allografts were 
sterilized with 2.5 Mrad of irradiation before distribution and were obtained 
from a single certified tissue bank. Graft fixation on the femoral side was by 
an Endobutton, and on the tibial side by a bioabsorbable interference screw 
augmented with a staple. The same rehabilitation protocol was applied to all 
patients. Before surgery and at a mean of 6.9 years of follow-up, patients were 
evaluated by the same observer according to objective and subjective clinical 
evaluations including detailed history, physical examination, radiography, 
functional knee ligament testing, KT-2000 arthrometer testing, Harner vertical

241,27528611,No Effects of Early Viscosupplementation After Arthroscopic Partial Meniscectomy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,  Focus on (+) secondary endpoint,,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: The management of the postoperative period after knee arthroscopic 
surgery may be challenging because surgical trauma deeply alters the joint 
microenvironment, causing the release of several catabolic molecules and 
proinflammatory factors that might slow down functional recovery. The 
possibility of using hyaluronic acid (HA) to promote postoperative pain relief 
and expedite functional improvement seems attractive, considering its biological 
properties.
PURPOSE: The aim of the present double-blind randomized controlled trial was to 
evaluate the effects, in terms of pain control and functional recovery, provided 
by a single HA injection performed at the end of arthroscopic meniscectomy.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: A total of 90 patients, 18 to 55 years old, were included according to 
the following criteria: (1) chronic, symptomatic meniscal tears requiring 
partial resection; (2) a healthy contralateral knee; (3) no previous surgery on 
the index knee; and (4) no other concurrent articular lesions requiring surgical 
treatment (eg, cartilage or ligament injuries). Patients were randomized into 2 
treatment groups: one underwent meniscectomy alone, whereas the other also 
received an injection of 3 mL HA at the end of the procedure. The primary 
outcomes were pain control and functional recovery. All patients were 
evaluated at baseline and then at 15, 30, 60, and 180 days using the following 
tools: International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective, Knee injury 
and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, VAS 
for general health status, and Tegner scores. The transpatellar circumference 
and active and passive ranges of motion were also recorded during the follow-up 
evaluations.
RESULTS: No major adverse events were reported using HA postoperatively. No 
significant intergroup difference was documented at any follow-up evaluation for 
any of the clinical scores. No difference was observed in the objective 
measurements. The mean time to return to full sports activity was not different 
between groups, and a comparable satisfaction rate was recorded in both 
treatment groups.

240,27528611,No Effects of Early Viscosupplementation After Arthroscopic Partial Meniscectomy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,  Focus on (+) secondary endpoint,,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: The management of the postoperative period after knee arthroscopic 
surgery may be challenging because surgical trauma deeply alters the joint 
microenvironment, causing the release of several catabolic molecules and 
proinflammatory factors that might slow down functional recovery. The 
possibility of using hyaluronic acid (HA) to promote postoperative pain relief 
and expedite functional improvement seems attractive, considering its biological 
properties.
PURPOSE: The aim of the present double-blind randomized controlled trial was to 
evaluate the effects, in terms of pain control and functional recovery, provided 
by a single HA injection performed at the end of arthroscopic meniscectomy.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: A total of 90 patients, 18 to 55 years old, were included according to 
the following criteria: (1) chronic, symptomatic meniscal tears requiring 
partial resection; (2) a healthy contralateral knee; (3) no previous surgery on 
the index knee; and (4) no other concurrent articular lesions requiring surgical 
treatment (eg, cartilage or ligament injuries). Patients were randomized into 2 
treatment groups: one underwent meniscectomy alone, whereas the other also 
received an injection of 3 mL HA at the end of the procedure. All patients were 
evaluated at baseline and then at 15, 30, 60, and 180 days using the following 
tools: International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective, Knee injury 
and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, VAS 
for general health status, and Tegner scores. The transpatellar circumference 
and active and passive ranges of motion were also recorded during the follow-up 
evaluations.
RESULTS: No major adverse events were reported using HA postoperatively. A 
statistically significant increase in all the clinical scores was reported in 
both treatment groups, but no significant intergroup difference was documented 
at any follow-up evaluation. No difference was observed also in the objective 
measurements. The mean time to return to full sports activity was not different 
between groups, and a comparable satisfaction rate was recorded in both 
treatment groups.
CONCLUSION: Early postoperative viscosupplementation did not provide significant 
clinical benefits after arthroscopic meniscectomy. Despite the lack of major 
adverse events, the administration of a single HA injection at the end of the 
surgical procedure is not a successful strategy to provide either faster 
functional recovery or symptomatic improvement after meniscectomy.",no_spin,4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.4787754416465759, 'probability': 0.619541585445404}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00018618757894728333, 'probability': 0.9998138546943665}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.3189612030982971, 'probability': 0.7269037365913391}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00018523407925385982, 'probability': 0.9998148083686829}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.8332734107971191, 'probability': 0.43462422490119934}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0002603192115202546, 'probability': 0.9997397065162659}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.0190311670303345, 'probability': 0.3609444499015808}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00020680672605521977, 'probability': 0.9997931718826294}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.874094545841217, 'probability': 0.4172396659851074}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00025519452174194157, 'probability': 0.9997448325157166}]"

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether psoas impingement can be reduced using 
imageless navigation compared with the standard technique.
METHODS: The current study is a reanalysis of data from a randomized controlled

with or without the use of imageless navigation. The primary outcome was the 
risk for anterior protrusion of the cup above the acetabular rim and thus 
potential psoas impingement, defined as an overhang of the cup above the 
anterior acetabular rim as measured on postoperative CT, which was either 
controlled with the help of navigation or standard control by eye and palpation

12 weeks postoperatively. The primary outcomes were the Western Ontario 
McMasters Arthritis Index and Oxford Hip Scores. Secondary outcome measures 
included the EuroQoL, 10-meter walk test, and clinical and radiographic 
parameters.
RESULTS: Data analyses showed no difference between DAA (n = 35) and PA (n = 37) 
groups when comparing total scores for primary outcomes. No significant 
differences were observed for 10-meter walk test, EuroQoL, and radiographic 
analyses. There was an 83% incidence of lateral cutaneous nerve of 
thigh neuropraxia at the 12-week mark in the DAA group. No neuropraxias occurred

136,27687805,A Prospective Randomized Clinical Trial in Total Hip Arthroplasty-Comparing Early Results Between the Direct Anterior Approach and the Posterior Approach.,The Journal of Arthroplasty,,Claim benefit based on subgroup analysis,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: We report a prospective randomized study comparing early clinical 
results between the direct anterior approach (DAA) and posterior approach (PA) 
in primary hip arthroplasty.
METHODS: Surgeries were performed by 2 senior hip arthroplasty surgeons. 
Seventy-two patients with complete data were assessed preoperatively 2, 6, and 
12 weeks postoperatively. The primary outcomes were the Western Ontario 
McMasters Arthritis Index and Oxford Hip Scores. Secondary outcome measures 
included the EuroQoL, 10-meter walk test, and clinical and radiographic 
parameters.
RESULTS: Data analyses showed no difference between DAA (nВ = 35) and PA (nВ = 37) 
groups when comparing total scores for primary outcomes. No significant 
differences were observed for 10-meter walk test, EuroQoL, and radiographic 
analyses. Subgroup analysis for surgeon 1 identified that the DAA group had 
shorter acute hospital stay, less postoperative opiate requirements, and smaller 
wounds. However, this was offset by increased operative time, higher 
intraoperative blood loss, and weaker hip flexion at 2 and 6 weeks. Subgroup 
analysis of items on the Western Ontario McMasters Arthritis Index and Oxford 
Hip Score identified that hip flexion activity favored the DAA group up to 6 
weeks postoperatively. There was an 83% incidence of lateral cutaneous nerve of 
thigh neuropraxia at the 12-week mark in the DAA group. No neuropraxias occurred 
in the PA group. One dislocation occurred in each group. A single patient from 
the DAA group required reoperation for leg-length discrepancy.

Methods: Forty-two consecutive patients scheduled for hip arthroscopy were randomized into 2 postoperative pain control groups. One group received preemptive intra-articular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection, and the second group received preemptive periacetabular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection. Before closure all patients received an additional dose of 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% intra-articularly. Data were compared with respect to postoperative pain with visual analog scale (VAS) and analgesic consumption, documented in a pain diary for 2 weeks after surgery.

Results: Twenty-one patients were treated with intra-articular injection, and 21 patients with peri-acetabular injection. There were no significant differences with regards to patient demographics or surgical procedures. VAS scores recorded during the first 30 minutes postoperatively and 18 hours after surgery were significantly lower in the periacetabular group compared with in the intra-articular group (0.667 ± 1.49 vs 2.11 ± 2.29; P < .045 and 2.62 ± 2.2 vs 4.79 ± 2.6; P < .009).

vertigo (APV) to diazepam 5В mg or meclizine 25В mg orally. Demographic and 
historical features were recorded on a standardized data form. Patients recorded 
their initial level (t0) of vertigo on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) and 
after 30В min (t30) and 60В min (t60). The primary outcome parameter was the mean 
change in VAS score from t0 to t60. Differences between groups and 95% 
confidence intervals were calculated. Our a priori power calculation estimated 
that a sample size of 20 patients in each group was required to have an 80% 
power to detect a difference of 20В mm between treatment groups.
RESULTS: There were 20 patients in the diazepam group and 20 in the meclizine 
group. The two groups were similar with respect to patient demographics and 
presenting signs and symptoms. At t60, the mean improvements in the diazepam and 
meclizine groups were 36 and 40, respectively (difference -4; 95% confidence 
interval -20 to 12; pВ =В 0.60).
CONCLUSION: We found no difference between oral diazepam and oral meclizine for 
the treatment of ED patients with acute peripheral vertigo.",no_spin,4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.8578200936317444, 'probability': 0.4240855276584625}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0002273062855238095, 'probability': 0.9997726678848267}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.3685106337070465, 'probability': 0.6917638182640076}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00026174934464506805, 'probability': 0.9997382760047913}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.7968152165412903, 'probability': 0.45076224207878113}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00021050144277978688, 'probability': 0.9997895359992981}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.9335045218467712, 'probability': 0.39317336678504944}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0009650102583691478, 'probability': 0.9990354776382446}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.580328106880188, 'probability': 0.559714674949646}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0003178806509822607, 'probability': 0.9996821880340576}]"

Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 in patients with type 2 diabetes on insulin 
therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a double-blind trial, we randomized 46 people with 
type 2 diabetes to placebo or a low (108 вЂ‰CFU/d) or high dose (1010 вЂ‰CFU/d) of 
L. reuteri DSM 17938 for 12вЂ‰weeks. The primary endpoint was the effect of 
supplementation on glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). Secondary endpoints were 
insulin sensitivity (assessed by glucose clamp), liver fat content, body 
composition, body fat distribution, faecal microbiota composition and serum bile 
acids.
RESULTS: Supplementation with L. reuteri DSM 17938 for 12вЂ‰weeks did not affect 
HbA1c, liver steatosis, adiposity or microbiota composition. Participants who 
received the highest dose of L. reuteri exhibited increases in insulin 
sensitivity index (ISI) and serum levels of the secondary bile acid deoxycholic 
acid (DCA) compared with baseline, but these differences were not significant in 
the between-group analyses. Post hoc analysis showed that participants who 
responded with increased ISI after L. reuteri supplementation had higher 
microbial diversity at baseline, and increased serum levels of DCA after 
supplementation. In addition, increases in DCA levels correlated with 
improvement in insulin sensitivity in the probiotic recipients.
CONCLUSIONS: Intake of L. reuteri DSM 17938 for 12вЂ‰weeks did not affect HbA1c in 
people with type 2 diabetes on insulin therapy; however, L. reuteri improved 
insulin sensitivity in a subset of participants and we propose that high

(MPFL) reconstruction have both shown, either in isolation or in combination, to 
provide improved patellofemoral joint (PFJ) stability. There are few studies 
that provide evidence that this remains true in the long term.
PURPOSE: To compare the long-term results of patellar instability after TTT with 
and without MPFL reconstruction in 2 randomized groups.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: A total of 34 patients (36 knees) were randomized to 2 groups. The 
first group underwent lateral release (LR) and TTT for confirmed maltracking of 
the patella (control group). The second group underwent MPFL reconstruction in 
addition to TTT and LR (reconstruction group). The primary outcomes were 
validated questionnaires (Kujala score, Tegner activity score) and a visual 
analog scale (VAS) assessing their insecurity. Secondary outcomes included 
clinical assessment, redislocation rates, reoperation rates, time to return to 
activities, patient satisfaction, and quantitative computed tomography (CT) at 1 
year. Patients were followed up at a minimum of 5 years postoperatively. Two 
patients in the control group and 1 patient in the reconstruction group were 
lost to follow-up at 5 years.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the Kujala (P = .75), Tegner 
(P = .36), or VAS (P = .75) scores at any time period. One patient in the 
control group sustained a patellar redislocation at 3 years. Five patients in 
the control group and 2 in the reconstruction group had functional failures and 
required reoperations; however, this was not statistically significant (P = 
.30). There were no significant differences between groups in the time to return 
to school or work (P = .65) or sports (P = .38) after surgery. Patient 
satisfaction was higher in the reconstruction group compared with the control 
group (P = .04), and quantitative CT scans showed that the reconstruction group 
had improvement in the mean patellar tilt (6° vs -8°, respectively; P = .03) and 
mean congruence angle (13° vs -11°, respectively; P = .03) in the 
quadriceps-contracted state compared with the control group.

(MPFL) reconstruction have both shown, either in isolation or in combination, to 
provide improved patellofemoral joint (PFJ) stability. There are few studies 
that provide evidence that this remains true in the long term.
PURPOSE: To compare the long-term results of patellar instability after TTT with 
and without MPFL reconstruction in 2 randomized groups.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: A total of 34 patients (36 knees) were randomized to 2 groups. The 
first group underwent lateral release (LR) and TTT for confirmed maltracking of 
the patella (control group). The second group underwent MPFL reconstruction in 
addition to TTT and LR (reconstruction group). Patients were followed up with 
validated questionnaires (Kujala score, Tegner activity score), a visual analog 
scale (VAS) assessing their insecurity, and a clinical assessment at a minimum 
of 5 years postoperatively. Participants also underwent quantitative computed 
tomography (CT) at 1 year for comparison. Two patients in the control group and 
1 patient in the reconstruction group were lost to follow-up at 5 years.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the Kujala ( P = .75), Tegner 
( P = .36), or VAS ( P = .75) scores at any time period. One patient in the 
control group sustained a patellar redislocation at 3 years. Five patients in 
the control group and 2 in the reconstruction group had functional failures and 
required reoperations; however, this was not statistically significant ( P = 
.30). There were no significant differences between groups in the time to return 
to school or work ( P = .65) or sports ( P = .38) after surgery. Overall patient 
satisfaction was higher in the reconstruction group compared with the control 
group ( P = .04), and quantitative CT scans showed that the reconstruction group 
had a statistically significant improvement in the mean patellar tilt (6В° vs 
-8В°, respectively; P = .03) and mean congruence angle (13В° vs -11В°, 
respectively; P = .03) in the quadriceps-contracted state compared with the 
control group.
CONCLUSION: Reconstruction of the MPFL in addition to TTT and LR resulted in 
improved alignment parameters (congruence angle, patellar tilt angle) as well as 
patient satisfaction. The Kujala and Tegner scores were no different between the 
2 groups at any time period. There was insufficient evidence to conclude that 
the addition of MPFL reconstruction to TTT results in fewer redislocations or 
reoperations. This study concludes that MPFL reconstruction improves PFJ 
alignment and patient satisfaction; however, further studies with larger patient 
numbers are required to satisfy its significance with respect to redislocation 
rates and functional scores in the long term.",no_spin,6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.640251100063324, 'probability': 0.5271600484848022}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0003256267518736422, 'probability': 0.999674379825592}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.30822011828422546, 'probability': 0.7347534894943237}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00031442465842701495, 'probability': 0.9996856451034546}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.7027298808097839, 'probability': 0.4952315390110016}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00018773700867313892, 'probability': 0.9998122453689575}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.8055719137191772, 'probability': 0.4468322694301605}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -7.688703772146255e-05, 'probability': 0.9999231100082397}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.026065707206726, 'probability': 0.35841429233551025}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0002694958820939064, 'probability': 0.9997305274009705}]"

PURPOSE: To compare the clinical and anatomic outcomes of the interference screw 
(IS) and suture anchor (SA) fixation techniques for biceps tenodesis performed 
along with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: A total of 80 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair 
with SLBC lesions were prospectively enrolled and randomly divided according to 
the tenodesis method: the IS and SA groups. The primary outcome was the anatomic 
status of tenodesis estimated using magnetic resonance imaging or 
ultrasonography. Anatomic failure of tenodesis was determined when the biceps 
tendon was not traced in the intertubercular groove directly from the insertion 
site of the IS or SA. Secondary outcomes included functional outcomes evaluated 
with the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, American Shoulder and Elbow

RESULTS: Thirty-three patients in the IS group and 34 in the SA group were 
monitored for more than 2 years. Nine anatomic failures of tenodesis were 
observed: 7 in the IS group and 2 in the SA group (P = .083). All postoperative 
functional scores improved compared with the preoperative scores and were not 
significantly different between the groups, including the LHB score (all P > 
.05). In a multivariate analysis using logistic regression, IS fixation (P =

anatomic failure of tenodesis. In patients with tenodesis failure, the LHB score 
(P = .049) and the degree of Popeye deformity by the patient and examiner (P =

joint precede radiographic abnormalities of posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) 
by as much as decades. A growing body of evidence strongly suggests that the 
progression from anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury to PTOA is 
multifactorial, involving the interplay between biomechanical disturbances and 
biochemical homeostasis of articular cartilage.
PURPOSE: The purposes of this randomized study using an acute ACL injury model 
were to (1) evaluate the natural progression of inflammatory and 
chondrodegenerative biomarkers, (2) evaluate the relationship between subjective 
reports of pain and inflammatory and chondrodegenerative biomarkers, and (3) 
determine if postinjury arthrocentesis and corticosteroid injection offer the 
ability to alter this biochemical cascade.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: A total of 49 patients were randomized to 4 groups: group 1 
(corticosteroid at 4 days after ACL injury, placebo injection of saline at 2 
weeks), group 2 (placebo at 4 days after ACL injury, corticosteroid at 2 weeks), 
group 3 (corticosteroid at both time intervals), or a placebo group (saline 
injections at both time intervals). Patient-reported outcome measures and 
synovial biomarkers were collected at approximately 4 days, 11 days, and 5 weeks

using Wilcoxon tests, and the relationship between changes in outcome scores and 
biomarkers were assessed by calculating Spearman ПЃ. Outcomes and biomarkers were 
also compared between the 4 groups using Kruskal-Wallis tests.
RESULTS: No adverse events or infections were observed in any study patients. 
With the exception of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) and tumor necrosis 
factor-inducible gene 6 (TSG-6), chondrodegenerative markers worsened over the 
first 5 weeks while all patient-reported outcomes improved during this time, 
regardless of treatment group. Patient-reported outcomes did not differ between 
patients receiving corticosteroid injections and the placebo group. However, 
increases in C-telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II), associated with 
collagen type II breakdown, were significantly greater in the placebo group 
(1.32 В± 1.10 ng/mL) than in either of the groups that received the 
corticosteroid injection within the first several days after injury (group 1: 
0.23 В± 0.27 ng/mL [ P = .01]; group 3: 0.19 В± 0.34 ng/mL [ P = .01]).
CONCLUSION: PTOA begins at the time of injury and results early on in dramatic 
matrix changes in the knee. However, it is encouraging that early intervention 
with an anti-inflammatory agent was able to affect biomarkers of chondral 
degeneration. Should early intervention lead to meaningful changes in either the 
onset or severity of symptomatic PTOA, the current treatment paradigm for 
patients with ACL injury may have to be restructured to include early aspiration

allocated (1:1) via opaque sealed envelopes to HFWHO (maximum flow of 1 L/kg per 
min to a limit of 20 L/min using 1:1 air-oxygen ratio, resulting in a maximum 
FiO2 of 0В·6) or standard therapy (cold wall oxygen 100% via infant nasal 
cannulae at low flow to a maximum of 2 L/min) using a block size of four and 
stratifying for gestational age at birth. The primary outcome was time from 
randomisation to last use of oxygen therapy. All randomised children were 
included in the primary and secondary safety analyses. This trial is registered 
with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number 
ACTRN12612000685819.
FINDINGS: From July 16, 2012, to May 1, 2015, we randomly assigned 202 children 
to either HFWHO (101 children) or standard therapy (101 children). Median time 
to weaning was 24 h (95% CI 18-28) for standard therapy and 20 h (95% CI 17-34) 
for HFWHO (hazard ratio [HR] for difference in survival distributions 0В·9 [95% 
CI 0В·7-1В·2]; log rank p=0В·61). Fewer children experienced treatment failure on 
HFWHO (14 [14%]) compared with standard therapy (33 [33%]; p=0В·0016); of these 
children, those on HFWHO were supported for longer than were those on standard 
therapy before treatment failure (HR 0В·3; 95% CI 0В·2-0В·6; p<0В·0001). 20 (61%) of 
33 children who experienced treatment failure on standard therapy were rescued 
with HFWHO. 12 (12%) of children on standard therapy required transfer to the 
intensive care unit compared with 14 (14%) of those on HFWHO (difference -1%; 
95% CI -7 to 16; p=0В·41). Four adverse events occurred (oxygen desaturation and 
condensation inhalation in the HFWHO group, and two incidences of oxygen tubing 
disconnection in the standard therapy group); none resulted in withdrawal from 
the trial. No oxygen-related serious adverse events occurred. Secondary 
effectiveness outcomes are reported in the Results section.
INTERPRETATION: HFWHO did not significantly reduce time on oxygen compared with 
standard therapy, suggesting that early use of HFWHO does not modify the 
underlying disease process in moderately severe bronchiolitis. HFWHO might have 
a role as a rescue therapy to reduce the proportion of children requiring 
high-cost intensive care.",no_spin,4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.9545472860336304, 'probability': 0.38498637080192566}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0001842805795604363, 'probability': 0.9998157024383545}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.41783562302589417, 'probability': 0.6584704518318176}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0003297977091278881, 'probability': 0.9996702671051025}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.9902271628379822, 'probability': 0.37149226665496826}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0003358753747306764, 'probability': 0.9996641874313354}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.490093469619751, 'probability': 0.22535160183906555}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0021757043432444334, 'probability': 0.9978266954421997}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.822404146194458, 'probability': 0.43937408924102783}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00033623288618400693, 'probability': 0.999663770198822}]"

techniques for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Controversy has arisen as each 
conceptually differs in how the knee is balanced through bone and soft tissue 
management. The objective of the present study was to compare both the frequency 
of condylar liftoff and the location of femorotibial contact from extension 
through midflexion between patients undergoing GB or MR TKA.
METHODS: A total of 24 knees (23 patients) were randomly assigned at referral to 
either a surgeon performing MR or GB TKA with the same single radius, 
posterior-stabilized implant (12 per cohort). At 1-year postoperation, patients 
underwent biplanar radiographic imaging at 0В°, 20В°, 40В°, and 60В° of flexion. 
Condylar liftoff, contact location, and magnitude of excursion on each condyle 
were measured. Preoperative and postoperative clinical outcome scores were also 
collected.
RESULTS: There was no difference (PВ = .41) in the frequency of liftoff between 
cohorts. The MR cohort had more posterior contact on the medial condyle (P < 
.01) and more anterior contact on the lateral condyle (P < .01) throughout

179,28209275,Contact Kinematic Differences Between Gap Balanced vs Measured Resection Techniques for Single Radius Posterior-Stabilized Total Knee Arthroplasty.,The Journal of Arthroplasty,,"""Trend toward significance"" // ""Numerically longer survival"" or equivalent verbiage, Claim benefit based on (+) subgroup analysis",Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Measured resection (MR) and gap balancing (GB) are common surgical 
techniques for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Controversy has arisen as each 
conceptually differs in how the knee is balanced through bone and soft tissue 
management. The objective of the present study was to compare both the frequency 
of condylar liftoff and the location of femorotibial contact from extension 
through midflexion between patients undergoing GB or MR TKA.
METHODS: A total of 24 knees (23 patients) were randomly assigned at referral to 
either a surgeon performing MR or GB TKA with the same single radius, 
posterior-stabilized implant (12 per cohort). At 1-year postoperation, patients 
underwent biplanar radiographic imaging at 0°, 20°, 40°, and 60° of flexion. 
Condylar liftoff, contact location, and magnitude of excursion on each condyle 
were measured. Preoperative and postoperative clinical outcome scores were also 
collected.
RESULTS: There was no difference (P = .41) in the frequency of liftoff between 
cohorts. The MR cohort had more posterior contact on the medial condyle (P < 
.01) and more anterior contact on the lateral condyle (P < .01) throughout 
flexion. Motion patterns were similar between cohorts, with similar medial (P = 
.48) and lateral (P = .44) excursion, which was equal in magnitude between 
condyles for both MR (P = .48) and GB (P = .73). There was no difference in 
clinical outcome scores between groups.

168,28282221,Collagen Augmentation Improves the Quality of Cartilage Repair After Microfracture in Patients Undergoing High Tibial Osteotomy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,  Focus on (+) secondary endpoint,Claim benefit based on (+) secondary endpoint,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: The quality of cartilage repair after marrow stimulation is 
unpredictable. To overcome the shortcomings of the microfracture technique, 
various augmentation techniques have been developed. However, their efficacies 
remain unclear.
HYPOTHESIS: The quality of cartilage repair and clinical outcomes would be 
superior in patients undergoing high tibial osteotomy (HTO) with microfracture 
and collagen augmentation compared to those undergoing HTO with microfracture 
alone without collagen augmentation for the treatment of medial compartment 
osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.
METHODS: Twenty-eight patients undergoing HTO were randomized into 2 groups: 
microfracture alone (group 1, n = 14) or microfracture with collagen 
augmentation (group 2, n = 14). At 1 year postoperatively, second-look 
arthroscopic surgery and biopsy of repaired cartilage were performed at the time 
of HTO plate removal. Biopsy specimens were graded using the International 
Cartilage Repair Society Visual Assessment Scale II (ICRS II). In addition, 
imaging outcomes in terms of the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage 
repair tissue (MOCART) score were assessed based on magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI). Finally, clinical outcomes in terms of the visual analog scale (VAS) for 
pain score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International 
Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and Tegner activity scale score were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: The mean ICRS II score in group 2 was significantly higher than that in 
group 1 (1053.2 vs 885.4, respectively; P = .002). Group 2 showed greater 
improvement in tissue morphology, cell morphology, surface architecture, 
middle/deep zone assessment, and overall assessment compared with group 1 ( P < 
.050 for all comparisons). Imaging outcomes based on the MOCART score were 
superior in group 2 compared to those in group 1 on MRI at 1 year 
postoperatively (64.6 vs 45.4, respectively; P = .001). The degree of defect 
repair was better in group 2 than in group 1 ( P = .040). Clinical outcomes in 
terms of the VAS for pain score, KOOS, IKDC score, and Tegner activity scale 
score were improved in both groups without between-group differences ( P > .100 
for all comparisons).
CONCLUSION: The quality of cartilage repair after microfracture with collagen 
augmentation was superior to that after microfracture alone in patients

169,28282221,Collagen Augmentation Improves the Quality of Cartilage Repair After Microfracture in Patients Undergoing High Tibial Osteotomy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,  Focus on (+) secondary endpoint,Claim benefit based on (+) secondary endpoint,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: The quality of cartilage repair after marrow stimulation is 
unpredictable. To overcome the shortcomings of the microfracture technique, 
various augmentation techniques have been developed. However, their efficacies 
remain unclear.
HYPOTHESIS: The quality of cartilage repair and clinical outcomes would be 
superior in patients undergoing high tibial osteotomy (HTO) with microfracture 
and collagen augmentation compared to those undergoing HTO with microfracture 
alone without collagen augmentation for the treatment of medial compartment 
osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.
METHODS: Twenty-eight patients undergoing HTO were randomized into 2 groups: 
microfracture alone (group 1, n = 14) or microfracture with collagen 
augmentation (group 2, n = 14). At 1 year postoperatively, second-look 
arthroscopic surgery and biopsy of repaired cartilage were performed at the time 
of HTO plate removal. Biopsy specimens were graded using the International 
Cartilage Repair Society Visual Assessment Scale II (ICRS II). In addition, 
imaging outcomes in terms of the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage 
repair tissue (MOCART) score were assessed based on magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI). Clinical outcomes in terms of the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain 
score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International Knee 
Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and Tegner activity scale score were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: The mean ICRS II score in group 2 was significantly higher than that in 
group 1 (1053.2 vs 885.4, respectively; P = .002). Group 2 showed greater 
improvement in tissue morphology, cell morphology, surface architecture, 
middle/deep zone assessment, and overall assessment compared with group 1 ( P < 
.050 for all comparisons). Imaging outcomes based on the MOCART score were 
superior in group 2 compared to those in group 1 on MRI at 1 year 
postoperatively (64.6 vs 45.4, respectively; P = .001). The degree of defect 
repair was better in group 2 than in group 1 ( P = .040). Clinical outcomes in 
terms of the VAS for pain score, KOOS, IKDC score, and Tegner activity scale 
score showed no significant between-group differences ( P > .100 for all 
comparisons).
CONCLUSION: Microfracture with collagen augmentation was not more effective on 
clinical outcomes than microfracture alone in patients undergoing HTO for medial 
compartment osteoarthritis of the knee.",spin,4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -1.0639808177947998, 'probability': 0.3450793921947479}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00019178935326635838, 'probability': 0.9998082518577576}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.839828372001648, 'probability': 0.43178460001945496}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00022027450904715806, 'probability': 0.9997797012329102}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.8960101008415222, 'probability': 0.40819504857063293}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00022980909852776676, 'probability': 0.9997701644897461}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.116859793663025, 'probability': 0.32730597257614136}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00041476229671388865, 'probability': 0.9995853304862976}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.0957624912261963, 'probability': 0.33428463339805603}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0002641328901518136, 'probability': 0.9997358322143555}]"

Biological analysis of PRP has demonstrated an anti-inflammatory effect on the intra-articular environment.

Purpose: To compare the clinical and biological effects of an intra-articular injection of PRP with those of an intra-articular injection of HA in patients with mild to moderate knee OA.

Study design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods: A total of 111 patients with symptomatic unilateral knee OA received a series of either leukocyte-poor PRP or HA injections under ultrasound guidance. Clinical data were collected before treatment and at 4 time points across a 1-year period. Synovial fluid was also collected for analysis of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers before treatment and at 12 and 24 weeks after treatment. Several measures were used to assess results: (1) Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale; (2) International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee evaluation, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, and Lysholm knee score; and (3) difference in intra-articular biochemical marker concentrations.

Results: There were 49 patients randomized to treatment with PRP and 50 randomized to treatment with HA. No difference was seen between the groups in the primary outcome measure (WOMAC pain score). In the secondary outcome measure, linear contrasts identified a significantly higher IKDC score in the PRP group compared with the HA group at 24 weeks (mean ± standard error [SE], 65.5 ± 3.6 vs 55.8 ± 3.8, respectively; P = .013) and at final follow-up (52 weeks) (57.6 ± 3.37 vs 46.6 ± 3.76, respectively; P = .003). Linear contrasts also identified a statistically lower VAS score in the PRP group versus the HA group at 24 weeks (mean ± SE, 34.6 ± 3.24 vs 48.6 ± 3.7, respectively; P = .0096) and 52 weeks (44 ± 4.6 vs 57.3 ± 3.8, respectively; P = .0039). An examination of fixed effects showed that patients with mild OA and a lower body mass index had a statistically significant improvement in outcomes.

Conclusion: We found no difference between HA and PRP at any time point in the primary outcome measure: the patient-reported WOMAC pain score.

provided with 26 group-based sessions over the course of 12 months. Weight was 
measured in the clinic at months 0, 6, and 12.
RESULTS: Change in weight over time did not significantly differ by condition. 
However, race significantly moderated the effect of condition on weight loss 
(P = 0.04), such that African-American participants lost less weight than 
non-Hispanic white participants in the BT (6.2% vs. 11.5%) and BT + E conditions

104,28337847,Efficacy of environmental and acceptance-based enhancements to behavioral weight loss treatment: The ENACT trial.,Obesity,RESULTS: Focus on (+) subgroup analysis,,Obesity,claude_4.0-sonnet,"OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to compare weight loss through a traditional 
behavioral treatment (BT) approach that integrated skills for managing the 
obesogenic food environment (BTвЂ‰+вЂ‰E) with an approach that integrated 
environmental and acceptance-based skills (BTвЂ‰+вЂ‰EA). Moderators were examined as 
an exploratory aim.
METHODS: Adults (NвЂ‰=вЂ‰283) were randomly assigned to treatment condition and 
provided with 26 group-based sessions over the course of 12 months. Weight was 
measured in the clinic at months 0, 6, and 12.
RESULTS: Change in weight over time did not significantly differ by condition. 
However, race significantly moderated the effect of condition on weight loss 
(PвЂ‰=вЂ‰0.04), such that African-American participants lost less weight than 
non-Hispanic white participants in the BT (6.2% vs. 11.5%) and BTвЂ‰+вЂ‰E conditions 
(6.6% vs. 12.2%), but weight loss in these two groups was similar in the BTвЂ‰+вЂ‰EA 
condition (9.4% vs. 11.5%). Among African Americans, rates of achieving a 
clinically significant weight loss (i.e.,вЂ‰>вЂ‰5%) at 12 months were higher in 
BTвЂ‰+вЂ‰EA (80%) than BT (57%) or BTвЂ‰+вЂ‰E (48%) (PвЂ‰=вЂ‰0.04).

efficacy of autologous platelet-richВ plasma (PRP) injections and arthroscopic 
lateral release in treating chronic lateral epicondylitis (LE).
METHODS: Patients who had a clinical diagnosis of LE confirmed by ultrasound 
(US) were included in this study. A total of 101 patients received arthroscopic 
release (nВ = 50) or US-guided PRP injections (nВ = 51). Outcomes were assessed 
using a visual analog scale for pain, the Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation 
(PRTEE), and a calibrated hand dynamometer for grip strength.
RESULTS: Both patient groups experienced significant improvement in all 
measures. Between-group comparisons showed a significantly higher value in the 
PRP group only for grip strength at week 8 (PВ = .0073); all other significant 
differences were in favor of arthroscopy: overall pain (PВ = .0021), night pain

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) seems to achieve equal weight loss as laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), but there is still much debate about the quality of life (QOL) after LSG, mainly concerning the association with gastroesophageal reflux.

Materials and methods: Between February 2013 and February 2014, 150 patients were randomized to undergo either LSG or LRYGB in our clinic. Differences in QOL were compared between groups by using multiple QOL questionnaires at follow-up moments preoperatively and 2 and 12 months after surgery.

Results: After 12 months of follow-up, 128 patients had returned the questionnaires.

phospholipid bilayer encapsulating bupivacaine that can result in drug delivery 
up to 72 hours. Prior studies in lower extremity surgery demonstrated efficacy 
of LB in comparison to a single-shot peripheral nerve block; however, no study 
has investigated LB in a total shoulder arthroplasty population. Therefore, this 
study compared LB vs. an indwelling interscalene nerve block (IINB).
METHODS: This is a prospective, randomized study of 83 consecutive shoulder 
arthroplasty patients; 36 patients received LB and a ""bridge"" of 30 mL of 0.5% 
bupivacaine, and 47 patients received an IINB. The primary outcome was 
postoperative visual analog scale pain levels. Secondary outcomes included 
opiate consumption measured with oral morphine equivalents, length of hospital

Results: Weight, percent body fat (PBF), and fat mass (FM) reduced greater in the trial groups in comparison to the C group (P < 0.05).

regimens possessing in vitro MRSA activity provide improved outcomes compared 
with treatments lacking MRSA activity.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 
yields a higher clinical cure rate of uncomplicated cellulitis than cephalexin 
alone.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized 
superiority trial in 5 US emergency departments among outpatients older than 12 
years with cellulitis and no wound, purulent drainage, or abscess enrolled from 
April 2009 through June 2012. All participants had soft tissue ultrasound 
performed at the time of enrollment to exclude abscess. Final follow-up was 
August 2012.
INTERVENTIONS: Cephalexin, 500 mg 4 times daily, plus 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily, for 7 days (nвЂ‰=вЂ‰248 
participants) or cephalexin plus placebo for 7 days (nвЂ‰=вЂ‰248 participants).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome determined a priori in the 
per-protocol group was clinical cure, defined as absence of these clinical 
failure criteria at follow-up visits: fever; increase in erythema (>25%), 
swelling, or tenderness (days 3-4); no decrease in erythema, swelling, or 
tenderness (days 8-10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness 
(days 14-21). A clinically significant difference was defined as greater than 
10%.
RESULTS: Among 500 randomized participants, 496 (99%) were included in the 
modified intention-to-treat analysis and 411 (82.2%) in the per-protocol 
analysis (median age, 40 years [range, 15-78 years]; 58.4% male; 10.9% had 
diabetes). Median length and width of erythema were 13.0 cm and 10.0 cm. In the 
per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 182 (83.5%) of 218 
participants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 165 
(85.5%) of 193 in the cephalexin group (difference, -2.0%; 95% CI, -9.7% to 
5.7%; PвЂ‰=вЂ‰.50). In the modified intention-to-treat population, clinical cure 
occurred in 189 (76.2%) of 248 participants in the cephalexin plus 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 171 (69.0%) of 248 in the cephalexin 
group (difference, 7.3%; 95% CI, -1.0% to 15.5%; PвЂ‰=вЂ‰.07). Between-group adverse 
event rates and secondary outcomes through 7 to 9 weeks, including overnight 
hospitalization, recurrent skin infections, and similar infection in household 
contacts, did not differ significantly.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with uncomplicated cellulitis, the use 
of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared to cephalexin alone 
did not result in higher rates of clinical resolution of cellulitis in the 
per-protocol analysis. However, because imprecision around the findings in the 
modified intention-to-treat analysis included a clinically important difference 
favoring cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, further research may be 
needed.",no_spin,4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.9090986251831055, 'probability': 0.402887225151062}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00025829317746683955, 'probability': 0.9997417330741882}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.41894659399986267, 'probability': 0.6577392816543579}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0006093314150348306, 'probability': 0.9993908405303955}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.1665555238723755, 'probability': 0.31143784523010254}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0003743662964552641, 'probability': 0.9996257424354553}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -1.2810395956039429, 'probability': 0.27774837613105774}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0018203369108960032, 'probability': 0.9981813430786133}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.8184093236923218, 'probability': 0.4411327838897705}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00038485272671096027, 'probability': 0.9996153116226196}]"

METHODS: The study was a single-center, randomized, double-blinded, 
placebo-controlled clinical trial on the efficacy of IV vs oral acetaminophen in 
patients undergoing unilateral TKA. One hundred seventy-four subjects were 
randomized to one of the 3 groups: IV acetaminophen group (IV group, n = 57) 
received 1 g IV acetaminophen and oral placebo before postanesthesia care unit

outcome was average PACU pain scores. Secondary outcomes included maximum pain 
score, pain scores before physical therapy, total opiate consumption, time to

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether TTM at 33В°C for 48 hours results in better 
neurologic outcomes compared with currently recommended, standard, 24-hour TTM.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was an international, 
investigator-initiated, blinded-outcome-assessor, parallel, pragmatic, 
multicenter, randomized clinical superiority trial in 10 intensive care units 
(ICUs) at 10 university hospitals in 6 European countries. Three hundred 
fifty-five adult, unconscious patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were 
enrolled from February 16, 2013, to June 1, 2016, with final follow-up on 
December 27, 2016.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to TTM (33вЂ‰В±вЂ‰1В°C) for 48 hours (nвЂ‰=вЂ‰176) 
or 24 hours (nвЂ‰=вЂ‰179), followed by gradual rewarming of 0.5В°C per hour until 
reaching 37В°C.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was 6-month neurologic outcome, 
with a Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) score of 1 or 2 used to define 
favorable outcome. Secondary outcomes included 6-month mortality, including time 
to death, the occurrence of adverse events, and intensive care unit resource 
use.
RESULTS: In 355 patients who were randomized (mean age, 60 years; 295 [83%] 
men), 351 (99%) completed the trial. Of these patients, 69% (120/175) in the 
48-hour group had a favorable outcome at 6 months compared with 64% (112/176) in 
the 24-hour group (difference, 4.9%; 95% CI, -5% to 14.8%; relative risk [RR], 
1.08; 95% CI, 0.93-1.25; PвЂ‰=вЂ‰.33). Six-month mortality was 27% (48/175) in the

-16.1% to 3.1%; RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.59-1.11; PвЂ‰=вЂ‰.19). There was no significant 
difference in the time to mortality between the 48-hour group and the 24-hour 
group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.54-1.15; PвЂ‰=вЂ‰.22). Adverse events were more 
common in the 48-hour group (97%) than in the 24-hour group (91%) (difference,

139,28844420,A prospective randomized controlled trial to identify the optimal postoperative pain management in shoulder arthroplasty: liposomal bupivacaine versus continuous interscalene catheter.,Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery,,"Claim benefit based only on efficacy, ignore safety (or vice versa)",Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Shoulder arthroplasty is the fastest growing joint replacement 
surgery in the United States, and optimal postoperative pain management is 
critical to optimize outcomes for these surgeries. Liposomal bupivacaine (LB) 
has gained popularity for its potential to provide extended postoperative pain 
relief with possibly fewer side effects. The goal of this study was to assess 
the impact of LB compared with continuous interscalene nerve block (CISB) in 
terms of postoperative pain control after shoulder arthroplasty surgery.
METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled clinical trial compared consecutive 
patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty treated with CISB vs. LB with a single 
bolus interscalene block. The primary outcome measures included pain assessment 
up to 24 hours after surgery; in addition, all doses and times of narcotics 
administered during the inpatient stay were recorded. Patient-reported outcome 
measures for pain, satisfaction, and functional outcomes were recorded 
postoperatively.
RESULTS: A total of 70 of 74 consecutive patients who underwent shoulder 
arthroplasty were included in the study. The LB group had equivalent narcotic 
use, pain scores, and time to first narcotic rescue compared with the CISB group 
within the first 24 hours (P > .05). The LB group had higher American Shoulder 
and Elbow Surgeons score and Penn Shoulder Score at final follow-up. There was

enrolled (n = 104) and randomized to one single oral dose (0.15mg/kg) of 
ondansetron (n = 52) or placebo (n = 52). The number of diarrhoea and vomiting 
episodes during the 24 hours following treatment was reported as well as the 
number of days with symptoms. Pathogens in faeces were diagnosed by real-time 
PCR. Outcome parameters were analyzed for rotavirus- and norovirus-positive 
children.
RESULTS: One dose of oral ondansetron reduced duration of rotavirus clinical 
symptoms (p = 0.014), with a median of two days. Furthermore, ondansetron 
reduced diarrhea episodes, most pronounced in children that had been sick for 
more than 3 days before treatment (p = 0.028).
CONCLUSION: Ondansetron may be a beneficial treatment for children with 
rotavirus gastroenteritis.",no_spin,8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.4908851087093353, 'probability': 0.6120843887329102}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -8.439661905867979e-05, 'probability': 0.999915599822998}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.37794244289398193, 'probability': 0.6852699518203735}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.000144709600135684, 'probability': 0.9998552799224854}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.8377501964569092, 'probability': 0.4326828718185425}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -8.272782724816352e-05, 'probability': 0.9999173283576965}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.4523696303367615, 'probability': 0.6361189484596252}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00011586471373448148, 'probability': 0.9998840689659119}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.7470256090164185, 'probability': 0.47377365827560425}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -9.047575440490618e-05, 'probability': 0.999909520149231}]"

important component of multimodal approaches to treat total knee arthroplasty 
postoperative pain. Liposomal bupivacaine may provide prolonged analgesic 
duration when injected into the surrounding tissues. The purpose of this study 
was to compare the analgesic efficacy and serum bupivacaine levels of a 
continuous femoral nerve block (CFNB) with bupivacaine to PAI with liposomal 
bupivacaine.
METHODS: Sixty-five patients undergoing primary unilateral total knee 
arthroplasty were randomized into 2 groups: (1) CFNB and PAI with bupivacaine 
(CFNB group) or (2) PAI with bupivacaine:liposomal bupivacaine mixture at the

knee flexion 24 hours following surgery. Secondary outcomes included pain 
intensities at rest and movement at timed intervals and serum bupivacaine

RESULTS: Patients in the CFNB group experienced lower pain scores at maximum 
knee flexion at 24 hours (7.91; 95% confidence interval, 7.19-8.61) compared to 
the LB group (8.95; 95% confidence interval, 8.42-9.48; P = .02). The mean peak

varieties of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) as an adjuvant to arthroscopic rotator 
cuff repair (ARCR) result in improved tendon healing rates.
PURPOSE: To perform a network meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials 
in the literature to ascertain whether there is evidence to support the use of 
LP- or LR-PRP as an adjunct to ARCR.
METHODS: The literature search was based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Randomized 
controlled trials comparing LP- or LR-PRP with a control alongside ARCR were 
included. Clinical outcomes, including retears and functional outcomes, were 
compared using a frequentist approach to network meta-analysis, with statistical 
analysis performed using R. The treatment options were ranked using the P-score.
RESULTS: There were 13 studies (868 patients) included, with 9 studies comparing 
LP-PRP with a control and 4 studies comparing LR-PRP with a control. LP-PRP was 
found to significantly reduce the rate of retear and/or incomplete tendon 
healing after fixation, even among medium-large tears; it also improved outcomes 
on the visual analog scale for pain, Constant score, and University of 
California Los Angeles score. LP-PRP had the highest P-score for all treatment 
groups. LR-PRP did not result in any significant improvements over the control 
group, except for visual analog scale score for pain. However, post hoc analysis 
revealed that LP-PRP did not lead to significant improvements over LR-PRP in any 
category.
CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrates that LP-PRP reduces the rate of 
retear and/or incomplete tendon healing after ARCR and improves patient-reported
