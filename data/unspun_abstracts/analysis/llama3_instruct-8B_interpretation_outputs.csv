254,18237696,Prospective randomized comparison of anatomic single- and double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy",  Focus on (+) secondary endpoint,,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Purpose
To determine if anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is superior to anatomic single-bundle reconstruction in restoring the stabilities and functions of the knee joint.
Methods
A prospective randomized clinical study was done to compare the results of 32 cases of anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction and 34 cases of anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction with average follow-up of 16.3 В± 3.1В months. Tunnel placements of all the cases were measured on 3D CT. Clinical results were collected after reconstruction; graft's appearance, meniscus status and cartilage state under arthroscopy were compared and analysed too.
Results
Tunnel placements, confirmed with 3D CT, were in the anatomic positions as described in literature both in SB and DB group. No differences were found between SB and DB groups in clinical outcome scores, pivot shift test and KT 1000В measurements (average side-to-side difference for anterior tibial translation was 0.7В mm in SB group and 1.0В mm in DB group). More than 70 % of the single-bundle graft and AM bundle graft in DB group appeared excellent, but only 44.1 % of PL bundle grafts in DB group were excellent and 11.8 % were in poor state. No new menisci tear was found either in SB or DB group, however, in DB group cartilage damages in medial patella-femoral joint occurred in 38.2 % cases. This rate was significantly higher than in the SB group which is only 9.3 %.
Conclusion
Both single- and double-bundle anatomic ACL reconstruction can restore the knee's stability and functions very well. However, more incidences of poor PL status and medial patellar-femoral cartilage damage may occur in double-bundle ACL reconstruction.",no_spin,4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.8952535390853882, 'probability': 0.4085039794445038}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0004129749140702188, 'probability': 0.9995871186256409}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.9126227498054504, 'probability': 0.401469886302948}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0003815161471720785, 'probability': 0.9996185302734375}]",4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -1.102221965789795, 'probability': 0.3321322798728943}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0005040090763941407, 'probability': 0.9994961619377136}]",4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.9843062162399292, 'probability': 0.3736983835697174}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0008253029081970453, 'probability': 0.9991750121116638}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.9534804821014404, 'probability': 0.3853972852230072}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0005566716426983476, 'probability': 0.9994434118270874}]"

dextrose in normal saline solution compared with normal saline solution will 
lead to a lower proportion of hospitalized patients and a greater reduction in 
serum ketone levels in children with gastroenteritis and dehydration.
METHODS: We enrolled children aged 6 months to 6 years in a double-blind, 
randomized controlled trial of patients presenting to a pediatric emergency 
department. Subjects were randomized to receive a 20 mL/kg infusion of either 5% 
dextrose in normal saline solution or normal saline solution. Serum ketone 
levels were measured before and at 1- and 2-hour intervals after the initial 
study fluid bolus administration. Primary outcome was the proportion of children 
hospitalized. Secondary outcome was change in serum ketone levels over time.
RESULTS: One hundred eighty-eight children were enrolled. The proportion of 
children hospitalized did not differ between groups (35% in the 5% dextrose in 
normal saline solution group versus 44% in the normal saline solution group;

Methods: In the present prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical study, 30 patients were divided into two groups: 15 patients (group I) were treated with arthroscopy-guided suprascapular nerve block using 10 mL 0.5 % ropivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine, and 15 patients (group II) were treated with placebo using 10 mL 0.9 % saline after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Patient pain levels were measured using the visual analog scale (VAS) at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h post-operatively.

198,23455386,Efficacy of direct arthroscopy-guided suprascapular nerve block after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair: a prospective randomized study.,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy",,Claim benefit based on (+) secondary endpoint,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of arthroscopy-guided direct suprascapular nerve block performed after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

Methods: In the present prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical study, 30 patients were divided into two groups: 15 patients (group I) were treated with arthroscopy-guided suprascapular nerve block using 10 mL 0.5 % ropivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine, and 15 patients (group II) were treated with placebo using 10 mL 0.9 % saline after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Patient pain levels were measured using the visual analog scale (VAS) at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h post-operatively. Additionally, the number of boluses and total amount of fentanyl dispensed by patient-controlled analgesia administration during the 24-h post-operative period were evaluated.

Results: VAS scores did not differ significantly between groups I and II during the 24-h post-operative period, but mean fentanyl bolus consumption was significantly less in group I compared with group II (p = 0.015).

Conclusion: Arthroscopy-guided suprascapular nerve block at the end of a rotator cuff repair was safe and less time-consuming than expected.

Questions/purposes: We (1) compared three-planar component alignment and overall coronal mechanical alignment between PSG and conventional instrumentation and (2) logged the need for applying changes in the suggested position of the PSG.

Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, we enrolled 128 patients. The primary outcome was overall coronal mechanical alignment.

was 500 mL normal saline solution and then 67 mL/hour for up to 24 hours. The 
primary outcome was contrast-induced nephropathy, defined as an increase in 
creatinine level of 25% or 0.5 mg/dL, measured 48 to 72 hours after CT.
RESULTS: The data safety and monitoring board terminated the study early for 
futility. Of 399 patients enrolled, 357 (89%) completed follow-up and were 
included. The N-acetylcysteine plus saline solution group contrast-induced 
nephropathy rate was 14 of 185 (7.6%) versus 12 of 172 (7.0%) in the normal 
saline solution only group (absolute risk difference 0.6%; 95% confidence 
interval -4.8% to 6.0%). The contrast-induced nephropathy rate in patients 
receiving less than 1 L intravenous fluids in the emergency department (ED) was 
19 of 147 (12.9%) versus 7 of 210 (3.3%) for greater than 1 L intravenous fluids 
(difference 9.6%; 95% confidence interval 3.7% to 15.5%), a 69% risk reduction 
(odds ratio 0.41; 95% confidence interval 0.21 to 0.80) per liter of intravenous 
fluids.
CONCLUSION: We did not find evidence of a benefit for N-acetylcysteine 
administration to our ED patients undergoing contrast-enhanced CT. However, we 
did find a significant association between volume of intravenous fluids 
administered and reduction in contrast-induced nephropathy.",no_spin,4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.905723512172699, 'probability': 0.40424928069114685}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00030048147891648114, 'probability': 0.999699592590332}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.45929449796676636, 'probability': 0.6317291855812073}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00046039948938414454, 'probability': 0.9995397329330444}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.7131989002227783, 'probability': 0.49007394909858704}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00033384948619641364, 'probability': 0.9996662139892578}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.922612726688385, 'probability': 0.39747917652130127}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0004378790326882154, 'probability': 0.9995622634887695}]",Score: 2,2,"[{'token': 10793, 'token_string': 'Score', 'logits': -1.0784300565719604, 'probability': 0.3401291072368622}, {'token': 25, 'token_string': ':', 'logits': -1.764281842042692e-05, 'probability': 0.9999822974205017}, {'token': 220, 'token_string': ' ', 'logits': -2.3841855067985307e-07, 'probability': 0.9999997019767761}, {'token': 17, 'token_string': '2', 'logits': -0.05994211882352829, 'probability': 0.9418190121650696}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.021243302151560783, 'probability': 0.9789807200431824}]"

New video-guided airway management technology is available, which may minimize the risk to patients from this procedure.

Methods: This was a controlled clinical trial conducted in the trauma receiving unit in a university-affiliated urban hospital in which 623 consecutive adult patients requiring emergency airway management were prospectively randomized to intubation with either the direct laryngoscope (DL) or the GlideScope video laryngoscope (GVL) device. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes included intubation duration, first-pass success, and incidence of low oxygen saturations.

Results: There was no significant difference in mortality between the GVL group (28 [9%] of 303) and the DL group (24 [8%] of 320) (p = 0.43).

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of the two procedures in patients older than 55 years of age affected by reparable rotator cuff tears with concomitant long head biceps pathologies.

Methods: Patients older than 55 years of age with long head biceps lesions and reparable rotator cuff tears were selected for this study. A total of 151 patients were randomly assigned to the tenotomy group (77 patients) or the tenodesis group (74 patients). Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was performed in all the patients. Before surgery, physical and radiological examinations were performed; the constant score was measured as well. After the operation, the surgical time, cost, pain (VAS scores), Popeye sign, cramping pain, constant scores, satisfaction level and the elbow flexion and forearm supination strength indices were recorded.

Results: Patients were followed for an average of 24 months. No significant differences in the clinical results for the constant scores, the forearm supination and elbow flexion strength indices, Popeye sign, cramping pain and satisfaction level were found between the groups. However, tenotomy required a shorter surgical time (40.4 ± 4.0 vs. 50.4 ± 5.9 min, P < 0.001) and resulted in faster pain relief (3.1 ± 1.8 vs. 4.8 ± 1.9, P < 0.001).

Conclusion: Both tenotomy and tenodesis are effective and equal for the treatment of long head biceps lesions.

days; 95% CI -3.1, -0.5; P = 0.039) for all LRTI and from 9.1 to 5.7 days for 
pneumonia (-3.4 days 95% CI -4.9, -1.7; P<0.001). There was no apparent 
difference in impairment of daily activities between PCT guided and control 
patients.
CONCLUSION: PCT guidance reduced antibiotic exposure by reducing the duration of 
antibiotic treatment, while not affecting the antibiotic prescribing rate. The 
latter may be explained by the low baseline prescribing rate in Switzerland for 
pediatric LRTI and the choice of an inappropriately low PCT cut-off level for 
this population.",no_spin,6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.8280538320541382, 'probability': 0.43689876794815063}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0002746204845607281, 'probability': 0.999725341796875}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.691460907459259, 'probability': 0.5008438229560852}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00034528967808000743, 'probability': 0.9996548295021057}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.1175663471221924, 'probability': 0.3270748257637024}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00035577642847783864, 'probability': 0.9996443390846252}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.0791146755218506, 'probability': 0.3398963212966919}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.000548331590835005, 'probability': 0.9994518756866455}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.1810271739959717, 'probability': 0.3069632947444916}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00021908267808612436, 'probability': 0.9997809529304504}]"

However, there are unanswered questions about the performance of hemiarthroplasty over the longer term compared with internal fixation.

Questions/purposes: We sought to compare hemiarthroplasty with internal fixation in terms of (1) outcomes scores for pain, hip function, and quality of life at a minimum of 5 years after surgery in a randomized trial. A secondary purpose was to compare (2) patient survival and (3) frequency of reoperation in the two groups.

Methods: A total of 222 consecutive patients older than 60 years, including those cognitively impaired, with FNF were randomized to either internal fixation with two parallel screws or bipolar hemiarthroplasty. At a minimum followup of 4.9 years (mean, 5.9 years; range, 4.9-7.2 years), 68 of the 70 surviving patients were examined by a study nurse and study physiotherapist blinded to initial treatment. Questionnaires on hip function (Harris hip score), quality of life (Eq5D), and activity of daily living function (Barthel ADL) were administered. The Barthel ADL index score was split into good function (score 95 or 100) and reduced function (score below 95).

Results: The mean survival of the groups was similar with 66.4% (73 of 110) of the patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty and 70.5% (79 of 112) of the patients undergoing internal fixation having died since surgery (p = 0.51). Only 12 of 31 living patients in the internal fixation group had retained their native hips at a mean of 6 years. Between 2 and 6 years, there were two new major reoperations (both in the internal fixation group, for avascular necrosis and deep wound infection). The mean Harris hip score was 66 (SD 19) and 67 (SD 20) in the internal fixation and hemiarthroplasty groups, respectively (p = 0.96). The mean Eq5D index was 0.50 (SD 0.40) in the internal fixation group and 0.34 (SD 0.36) in the hemiarthroplasty group (p = 0.10).

Most MIS TKA surgeons (and many surgeons who use other approaches as well) excise the fat pad for better exposure of the knee. There is still controversy about the result of fat pad excision on patella baja, pain, and function.

Questions/purposes: In the setting of a randomized controlled trial, we sought to determine whether infrapatellar fat pad excision during MIS TKA causes (1) patellar tendon shortening (as measured by patella baja); (2) increased anterior knee pain; (3) decreases in the Knee Society Score or functional subscore; or (4) more patella-related complications.

Methods: We randomized 90 patients undergoing MIS TKA at one institution into two groups. In one group, 45 patients underwent MIS TKA with complete infrapatellar fat pad excision and in the other group, 45 patients received MIS TKA without infrapatellar fat pad excision. The patella was selectively resurfaced in these patients; there was no difference between the groups in terms of the percentage of patients whose patellae were resurfaced. We measured patellar tendon shortening, knee flexion, anterior knee pain, Knee Society Score (KSS), functional subscore, and patellar complications at preoperative and postoperative periods of 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year; complete followup data were available on 86% of patients (77 of 90) who were enrolled.

Results: At the final followup, no significant differences were observed in patellar tendon shortening, KSS, functional subscore, or knee flexion in either group. However, patients with their infrapatellar fat pad excised experienced more anterior knee pain (8.3% versus 0%; p = 0.03; 95% confidence interval, -0.007 to 0.174) at the end of the study. No patellar complications were found in either group.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We compared the side effect profile, analgesic efficacy, and

block (FNB) after TKA.
METHODS: Ninety-four patients undergoing unilateral TKA were prospectively 
randomized to receive a spinal-epidural analgesic infusion plus a 
single-injection FNB or a spinal anesthetic plus a continuous postoperative 
intraarticular infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine. All patients were blinded to their 
treatment with placebo saline catheters. Blinded coinvestigators collected data 
concerning side effect profiles (nausea, hypotension), analgesic efficacy (VAS 
pain scores, narcotic usage), and functional recovery (timed up and go test, 
quadriceps strength, WOMAC scores, Knee Society scores, early postoperative 
ambulatory ability, in-hospital falls). All complications and adverse events 
were recorded.
RESULTS: The frequency of nausea and hypertension was not different between the 
study groups. During the first 12 and 24 postoperative hours, the mean maximum 
VAS pain scores were higher in the ropivacaine group than in the epidural group

versus 1.93, respectively, p = 0.008). After 24 hours, pain scores were similar 
between groups. Narcotic consumption was higher in the ropivacaine 
group on the day of surgery, but overall in-hospital narcotic usage was similar 
between groups. There were no differences in functional 
recovery between groups at any time point. Patients in the epidural group 
were more likely to have knee buckling (32.7% versus 6.7%, p = 0.002) and 
delayed ambulation (16.3% versus 0.0%, p = 0.006) than patients in the

versus 1.93, respectively, pВ =В 0.008). After 24 hours, pain scores were similar 
between groups. Narcotic consumption was significantly higher in the ropivacaine 
group on the day of surgery, but overall in-hospital narcotic usage was similar 
between groups. There were no clinically important differences in functional 
recovery between groups at any time point, but patients in the epidural group 
were more likely to have knee buckling (32.7% versus 6.7%, pВ =В 0.002) and 
delayed ambulation (16.3% versus 0.0%, pВ =В 0.006) than patients in the 
ropivacaine group, though not in-hospital falls. No infections occurred in 
either group, and the frequency of complications was not different between 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: A continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine can be 
recommended as a safe, effective alternative to epidural analgesia plus 
single-injection FNB after TKA. Improved analgesic efficacy in the group that 
received epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB must be weighed against 
the disadvantage of a higher likelihood of knee buckling and delayed ambulation 
with that treatment approach.

METHODS: Parents were randomized to receive story booklets (n=208) or standard

RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the primary outcome of change in

utilize emergency departments (EDs) for acute and chronic care. We seek to 
determine whether a scalable, low-cost, unidirectional, text message-based 
mobile health intervention (TExT-MED) improves clinical outcomes, increases 
healthy behaviors, and decreases ED utilization in a safety net population.
METHODS: We conducted an randomized controlled trial of 128 adult patients with 
poorly controlled diabetes (glycosylated hemoglobin [Hb A1C] level в‰Ґ8%) in an 
urban, public ED. The TExT-MED group received 2 daily text messages for 6 months 
in English or Spanish. The primary outcome was change in Hb A1C level. Secondary 
outcomes included changes in medication adherence, self-efficacy, performance of 
self-care tasks, quality of life, diabetes-specific knowledge, ED utilization, 
and patient satisfaction.
RESULTS: Hb A1C level decreased by 1.05% in the TExT-MED group compared with 
0.60% in the controls (О”0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.27 to 1.17) at 6 
months. Secondary outcomes favored the TExT-MED group, with the most sizable 
change observed in self-reported medication adherence (as measured by the 
Morisky Medication Adherence Scale, an 8-point validated scale with higher 
scores representing better adherence), which improved from 4.5 to 5.4 in the 
TExT-MED group compared with a net decrease of -0.1 in the controls (О”1.1 [95% 
CI 0.1 to 2.1]). Effects were larger among Spanish speakers for both medication 
adherence (1.1 versus -0.3; О”1.4; 95% CI 0.2 to 2.7) and Hb A1C (-1.2% versus 
-0.4%) in the TExT-MED group. The proportion of patients who used emergency 
services trended lower in the TExT-MED group (35.9% versus 51.6%; О”15.7%; 95% CI 
9.4% to 22%). Overall, 93.6% of respondents enjoyed TExT-MED and 100% would 
recommend it to family/friends.
CONCLUSION: The TExT-MED program did not result in a statistically significant 
improvement in Hb A1C. However, trends toward improvement in the primary outcome 
of Hb A1C and other secondary outcomes, including quality of life, were 
observed, the most pronounced being improved medication adherence. TExT-MED also 
decreased ED utilization. These findings were magnified in the Spanish-speaking 
subgroup. Technologies such as TExT-MED represent highly scalable, low-cost, and 
widely accessible solutions for safety-net ED populations.",no_spin,6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.5986631512641907, 'probability': 0.5495458245277405}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0004674295778386295, 'probability': 0.9995326995849609}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -0.943402111530304, 'probability': 0.3893011212348938}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0003746046277228743, 'probability': 0.9996254444122314}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.8367941975593567, 'probability': 0.433096706867218}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0003830652858596295, 'probability': 0.9996170401573181}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.0444542169570923, 'probability': 0.35188382863998413}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0001716466504149139, 'probability': 0.9998283386230469}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.9346020817756653, 'probability': 0.3927420973777771}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00046004203613847494, 'probability': 0.9995400905609131}]"

posterior-cruciate-ligament-stabilized (PS) arthroplasties are two major common 
practices in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The hypothesis of the present study 
was that compared with the PCR technique, the PS technique is associated with a 
higher amount of postoperative blood loss and greater need for blood transfusion 
in cemented TKA.
METHODS: In this prospective, randomized study, 100 patients diagnosed with 
primary knee osteoarthritis were randomly assigned to either the PCR group 
(Group I) or the PS group (Group II). The exclusion criteria were 
rheumatological joint disease, previous knee surgery, anticoagulant therapy and 
hypertension. There were no significant differences in age, body mass index and 
gender, between the groups. The haemoglobin and haematocrit levels of each 
patient were recorded preoperatively and on postoperative days 1, 3 and 5. The 
postoperative suction drainage and blood transfusion volumes were also recorded.

192,24664198,Effectiveness of sustained stretching of the inferior capsule in the management of a frozen shoulder.,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,  Other,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Background: Physiotherapy treatment of frozen shoulder is varied, but most lack specific focus on the underlying disorder, which is the adhered shoulder capsule. Although positive effects were found after physiotherapy, the recurrence and prolonged disability of a frozen shoulder are major factors to focus on to provide the appropriate treatment.

Questions/purposes: We wished to study the effectiveness of a shoulder countertraction apparatus on ROM, pain, and function in patients with a frozen shoulder and compare their results with those of control subjects who received conventional physiotherapy.

Methods: A total of 100 participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group and a control group, with each group having 50 participants. The control group received physiotherapy and the experimental group received countertraction and physiotherapy. The total treatment time was 20 minutes a day for 5 days per week for 2 weeks. The outcome measures used were goniometer measurements, VAS, and the Oxford Shoulder Score.

Results: Improvements were seen in the scores for shoulder flexion (94.1Ў ± 19.79Ў at baseline increased to 161.9Ў ± 13.05Ў after intervention), abduction ROM (90.4Ў ± 21.18Ў at baseline increased to 154.8Ў ± 13.21Ў after intervention), and pain (8.00 ± 0.78 at baseline decreased to 3.48 ± 0.71 after intervention) in the experimental group.

193,24664198,Effectiveness of sustained stretching of the inferior capsule in the management of a frozen shoulder.,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,  Other,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Background: Physiotherapy treatment of frozen shoulder is varied, but most lack specific focus on the underlying disorder, which is the adhered shoulder capsule. Although positive effects were found after physiotherapy, the recurrence and prolonged disability of a frozen shoulder are major factors to focus on to provide the appropriate treatment.

Questions/purposes: We wished to study the effectiveness of a shoulder countertraction apparatus on ROM, pain, and function in patients with a frozen shoulder and compare their results with those of control subjects who received conventional physiotherapy.

Methods: A total of 100 participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group and a control group, with each group having 50 participants. The control group received physiotherapy and the experimental group received countertraction and physiotherapy. The total treatment time was 20 minutes a day for 5 days per week for 2 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Oxford Shoulder Score. Secondary outcome measures included goniometer measurements for range of motion and VAS for pain assessment.

Results: For the primary outcome, 60% of participants (n = 30) achieved the fourth stage of satisfactory joint function according to the Oxford Shoulder Score in the experimental group compared with 18% (n = 9) in the control group (p < 0.001). For secondary outcomes, shoulder flexion improved from 94.1° ± 19.79° at baseline to 161.9° ± 13.05° after intervention in the experimental group. Shoulder abduction ROM improved from 90.4° ± 21.18° at baseline to 154.8° ± 13.21° after intervention in the experimental group. Pain scores decreased from 8.00 ± 0.78 at baseline to 3.48 ± 0.71 after intervention in the experimental group.

Methods: Between January 2007 and January 2011, 87 patients who underwent arthroscopic Bankart repair with the use of knot-tying suture anchors or knotless suture anchors were evaluated, with 45 patients in the knot-tying suture group and 42 patients in the knotless group. Patients were assigned to either group, with odd-numbered patients going to the knot-tying suture arm and even-numbered patients assigned to the knotless arm. Outcomes included the Constant score, the visual analog scale (VAS) score, patient satisfaction score, and range of motion in forward flexion and external rotation with the arm in adduction. Redislocations or subluxations with the 2 techniques was also studied.

Results: Both groups showed a statistically significant improvement between the preoperative and postoperative VAS scores and Constant scores. In the knot-tying suture group, the VAS score improved from 2.5 ± 2.3 to 0.7 ± 0.5 (P < .05) and the Constant score improved from 64 ± 7 to 92 ± 10 (P < .05).

Methods: Sixty patients younger than 35 years of age with primary, traumatic, anterior shoulder dislocations were randomized (concealed, computer-generated) to immobilization with either an internal rotation sling (n = 29) or an external rotation brace (n = 31) at a mean of 4 days after closed reduction (range, 1-7 days).

Results: With the numbers available, there was no difference in the rate of recurrent instability between groups: 10 of 27 patients (37%) with the external rotation brace versus 10 of 25 patients (40%) with the sling redislocated or developed symptomatic recurrent instability (p = 0.41). WOSI scores were not different between groups (p = 0.74) and, although the difference in ASES scores approached statistical significance (p = 0.05), the magnitude of this difference was small and of uncertain clinical importance.

Conclusions: Despite previous published findings, our results show immobilization in external rotation did not confer a significant benefit versus sling immobilization in the prevention of recurrent instability after primary anterior shoulder dislocation. Further studies with larger numbers may elucidate whether functional outcomes, compliance, or comfort with immobilization can be improved with this device.",no_spin,4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.5878942012786865, 'probability': 0.5554957985877991}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0003334919747430831, 'probability': 0.9996666312217712}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.8202164173126221, 'probability': 0.44033631682395935}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.000399033073335886, 'probability': 0.9996010661125183}]",4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -1.1752196550369263, 'probability': 0.3087511658668518}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00034231049357913435, 'probability': 0.9996578097343445}]",0,0,"[{'token': 15, 'token_string': '0', 'logits': -1.2768950462341309, 'probability': 0.27890193462371826}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.007484608795493841, 'probability': 0.9925433397293091}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.2545788288116455, 'probability': 0.2851959466934204}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0006500753224827349, 'probability': 0.9993500709533691}]"

METHODS: The study was planned to be prospective and randomized. The primary outcome was reduction success. As procedural 
sedation analgesia (SA), titration of ketamine 1 to 2 mg/kg was administered 
intravenously to group 1. Suprascapular nerve block (SNB) was applied under 
ultrasound guidance (USG) to group 2. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay, complications, side 
effects, patient-physician satisfaction, and ease of application. Conformity to normal distribution of

placebo for adults with undifferentiated emergency department (ED) nausea and 
vomiting.
METHODS: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was 
conducted in 2 metropolitan EDs in Melbourne, Australia. Eligible patients with 
ED nausea and vomiting were randomized to receive 4 mg intravenous ondansetron, 
20 mg intravenous metoclopramide, or saline solution placebo. Primary outcome 
was mean change in visual analog scale (VAS) rating of nausea severity from 
enrollment to 30 minutes after study drug administration. Secondary outcomes 
included patient satisfaction, need for rescue antiemetic treatment, and adverse 
events.
RESULTS: Of 270 recruited patients, 258 (95.6%) were available for analysis. Of 
these patients, 87 (33.7%) received ondansetron; 88 (34.1%), metoclopramide; and 
83 (32.2%), placebo. Baseline characteristics between treatment groups and 
recruitment site were similar. Mean decrease in VAS score was 27 mm (95%

METHODS: Fifty-eight ACLI subjects were randomised to one of three (12-week 
duration) training groups. The STAND group trained according to a standardised

STAND group but with the addition of seated knee extensor open kinetic chain 
resistance training at loads of 2 sets of 20 repetition maximum (RM) and 20 sets

navigation enables intraoperative control of leg length equalization and offset 
reconstruction. However, the effect of navigation compared with intraoperative 
fluoroscopy is unclear.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether intraoperative use of imageless navigation 
(1) improves the relative accuracy of leg length and global and femoral offset 
restoration; (2) increases the absolute precision of leg length and global and 
femoral offset equalization; and (3) reduces outliers in a reconstruction zone 
of В± 5 mm for leg length and global and femoral offset restoration compared with 
intraoperative fluoroscopy during minimally invasive (MIS) THA with the patient 
in a lateral decubitus position.
METHODS: In this prospective study a consecutive series of 125 patients were 
randomized to either navigation-guided or fluoroscopy-controlled THA using 
sealed, opaque envelopes. All patients received the same cementless prosthetic 
components through an anterolateral MIS approach while they were in a lateral 
decubitus position. Leg length, global or total offset (representing the 
combination of femoral and acetabular offset), and femoral offset differences 
were restored using either navigation or fluoroscopy. Postoperatively, residual 
leg length and global and femoral offset discrepancies were analyzed on 
magnification-corrected radiographs of the pelvis by an independent and blinded 
examiner using digital planning software. Accuracy was defined as the relative 
postoperative difference between the surgically treated and the unaffected 
contralateral side for leg length and offset, respectively; precision was 
defined as the absolute postoperative deviation of leg length and global and 
femoral offset regardless of lengthening or shortening of leg length and offset

RESULTS: Analyzing the relative accuracy of leg length restoration we found a 
mean difference of 0.2 mm (95% CI, -1.0 to +1.4 mm; p = 0.729) between 
fluoroscopy and navigation, 0.2 mm (95 % CI, -0.9 to +1.3 mm; p = 0.740) for

worldwide. There remains considerable controversy over antivenom treatment. We 
aimed to investigate whether antivenom resulted in resolution of pain and

METHODS: In a multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial of redback spider 
antivenom for latrodectism, 224 patients (>7 years) with a redback spider bite 
and severe pain, with or without systemic effects, were randomized to receive 
normal saline solution (placebo) or antivenom after receiving standardized

was resolution of systemic features at 2 hours. Secondary outcomes were improved pain at 4 and 24 
hours, resolution of systemic features at 4 hours, administration of opioid 
analgesics or unblinded antivenom after 2 hours, and adverse reactions.
RESULTS: Two hours after treatment, 26 of 112 patients (23%) from the placebo

Intravenous morphine has been used as a common method of pain control in emergency care. NebulizedВ fentanylВ is also an effective temporary substitute. This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of nebulized fentanyl with intravenous (IV) morphine on management of acute limb pain.
Methods
This was a placebo-controlled, double-blindВ randomized clinical trial. Ninety emergency department patients with moderate to severe pain aged 15 to 50 years were blocked randomized and enrolled in this study. Forty-seven patients in the experimental group received nebulized fentanyl (4В Ојg/kg) and IV normal saline as placebo, and the remaining 43 patients in the control group received IV morphine (0.1 mg/kg) and nebulized normal saline as placebo. All participants' pain scores were assessed by Numerical Rating Scale before and after intervention at 5-, 10-, 15-, 30-, 45-, and 60-minute intervals. Patients' vital sign and possibleВ adverse effectsВ were recorded respectively. Finally, all participants were assessed for their satisfaction.
Results
The mean initial pain score in the experimental group was 8.7 and 8.4 in the control group (PВ = .1). Pain relief in both groups after 5 and 10 minutes were similar (PВ = .72). Although the pain relief was significantly greater with fentanyl at 15 minutes, this difference is not clinically significant. Pain management in both groups was successful and was more than 3 scores reduction in Numerical Rating Scale. Patient satisfaction in both groups was similar.

in subjects undergoing assessment for acute angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitor-induced angioedema (ACEIA) in an emergency department (ED).
METHODS: This was a multicenter, phase 2, double-blind study with subjects 
randomized to receive a single subcutaneous dose of ecallantide (10, 30, or 60 
mg) or placebo plus physician-directed conventional therapy. The primary 
endpoint was defined as meeting predetermined discharge eligibility criteria 
within 6 hours of study drug administration. Discharge criteria included 
improvement of edema, stable vital signs, absence of stridor, absence of dyspnea 
or use of accessory muscles during respiration, absence of drooling, and ability 
to drink without difficulty.
RESULTS: An interim analysis showed that a high percentage of subjects met the 
primary endpoint, and the study was halted. Overall, 79 subjects were randomized

CONCLUSION: The addition of ecallantide to standard therapy does not appear to 
improve angioedema compared with placebo in ED patients with ACEIA. Our data 
suggest that most ED patients presenting with mild to moderate ACEIA are likely 
to meet our discharge eligibility criteria within 6 hours of treatment,

This study assesses the accuracy of EMS providers' GCS scoring, as well as the improvement in GCS score assessment with the use of a scoring aid.
Methods: This randomized, controlled study was conducted in the emergency department (ED) of an urban academic trauma center. Emergency medical technicians or paramedics who transported a patient to the ED were randomly assigned one of 9 written scenarios, either with or without a GCS scoring aid. The primary outcome was accuracy of GCS scoring compared to expert consensus. Scenarios were created by consensus of expert attending emergency medicine, EMS, and neurocritical care physicians, with universal consensus agreement on GCS scores. χ² and Student's t tests were used to compare groups.
Results: Of 180 participants, 178 completed the study. Overall, 73 of 178 participants (41%) gave a GCS score that matched the expert consensus score.

This study assesses the accuracy of EMS providers' GCS scoring, as well as the improvement in GCS score assessment with the use of a scoring aid.
Methods:В This randomized, controlled study was conducted in the emergency department (ED) of an urban academic trauma center. Emergency medical technicians or paramedics who transported a patient to the ED were randomly assigned one of 9 written scenarios, either with or without a GCS scoring aid. Scenarios were created by consensus of expert attending emergency medicine, EMS, and neurocritical care physicians, with universal consensus agreement on GCS scores.

METHODS: Fifty-four patients diagnosed with unilateral painful calcific 
tendinitis were randomly allocated to a US needling or ESWT group. The US 
needling group underwent US-guided needling and received a subacromial 
corticosteroid injection. The ESWT group received ESWT 3 times a week. All

METHODS: A total of 256 patients undergoing TKA for primary osteoarthritis were 
randomized into one of six groups: a control group (saline solution, 
epinephrine, and cefazolin, n = 42), Group 1 (ropivacaine, n = 43), Group 2 
(ropivacaine + morphine, n = 43), Group 3 (ropivacaine + ketorolac, n = 42),

exacerbations was 3.59 in the placebo group vs 1.82 in the combined benralizumab 
groups (P = .01). Exacerbations resulting in hospitalization were 1.62 in the 
placebo group vs 0.65 in the combined benralizumab groups (P = .02). Benralizumab 
reduced blood eosinophil counts but did not affect other outcomes, while 
demonstrating an acceptable safety profile.

ganglion block for the treatment of acute anterior headache in the emergency 
department (ED) using a novel noninvasive delivery device.
METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial 
evaluating bupivacaine anesthesia of the sphenopalatine ganglion for acute 
anterior or global-based headache. This study was completed in 2 large academic 
EDs. Bupivacaine or normal saline solution was delivered intranasally (0.3 mL 
per side) with the Tx360 device. Pain and nausea were measured at 0, 5, and 15 
minutes by a 100-mm visual analog scale. The primary endpoint was a 50% 
reduction in pain at 15 minutes. Telephone follow-up assessed 24-hour pain and 
nausea through a 0- to 10-point verbal scale and adverse effects.
RESULTS: The median reported baseline pain in the bupivacaine group was 80 mm 
(IQR 66 mm - 93 mm) and 78.5 mm (IQR 64 mm to 91.75 mm) in the normal saline 
solution group. A 50% reduction in pain was achieved in 48.8% of the bupivacaine

the rotator cuff (RC) tear has not been well clarified.
PURPOSE: To compare the clinical results between patients who had distal 
clavicle resection (DCR) and those who did not during RC repair.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: From August 2008 to December 2009, a total of 56 consecutive patients 
(58 shoulders) were included. All patients had either a full-thickness or 
high-grade (>50%) RC tear, ACJ tenderness, arthritic change visible on plain 
radiographs, and a positive ACJ lidocaine injection test the day before surgery. 
Patients were randomized into 2 groups: DCR and RC repair (DCR+RCR group) and RC 
repair only (isolated RCR). Evaluation was performed preoperatively, at 6 months 
postoperatively, and at a final follow-up a minimum of 24 months postoperatively 
using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, the Constant 
shoulder score, range of motion examination, and pain visual analog scale (VAS).
RESULTS: After simple randomization, 26 shoulders were allocated in the DCR+RCR 
group, and 32 were placed in the isolated RCR group. Five shoulders in the 
DCR+RCR group and 6 in the isolated RCR group were excluded from analysis due to 
loss of follow-up. Therefore, the evaluation was performed for 21 shoulders in 
the DCR+RCR group and 26 shoulders in the isolated RCR group. The mean follow-up 
period was 44.2 months in the DCR+RCR group and 44.0 months in the isolated RCR 
group. There were no differences in age, sex, symptom duration, RC tear size, or 
preoperative ASES, Constant, and VAS scores between the 2 groups (P > .05). At 
final follow-up, the ASES, Constant, and VAS scores were significantly improved 
in both groups (P < .001). There were no differences in ASES, Constant, and VAS 
scores between the 2 groups at final follow-up (P > .05), and there was no 
difference in residual ACJ tenderness (7 in the DCR+RCR group and 5 in the 
isolated RCR group) between the 2 groups (P = .270).
CONCLUSION: There was no difference in the clinical evaluations between the 
combined arthroscopic DCR and RCR group and the isolated RCR group at a minimum 
24-month follow-up. Arthroscopic DCR should be carefully considered in patients 
who have symptomatic ACJ arthritis with RC tears.",no_spin,4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -1.1195590496063232, 'probability': 0.326423704624176}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0002530493075028062, 'probability': 0.9997469782829285}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.6082447171211243, 'probability': 0.5443054437637329}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00025722055579535663, 'probability': 0.9997427463531494}]",4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -1.0349735021591187, 'probability': 0.355235755443573}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0003054867556784302, 'probability': 0.9996945261955261}]",4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.9542959332466125, 'probability': 0.3850831389427185}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00036030475166626275, 'probability': 0.9996397495269775}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.084669828414917, 'probability': 0.33801335096359253}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0004642124113161117, 'probability': 0.999535858631134}]"

clavicle resection (DCR) and those who did not during RC repair.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: From August 2008 to December 2009, a total of 56 consecutive patients 
(58 shoulders) were included. All patients had either a full-thickness or 
high-grade (>50%) RC tear, ACJ tenderness, arthritic change visible on plain 
radiographs, and a positive ACJ lidocaine injection test the day before surgery. 
Patients were randomized into 2 groups: DCR and RC repair (DCR+RCR group) and RC 
repair only (isolated RCR). The primary outcome was the American Shoulder and 
Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score. Secondary outcomes included the Constant shoulder 
score, range of motion examination, and pain visual analog scale (VAS). 
Evaluation was performed preoperatively, at 6 months postoperatively, and at a 
final follow-up a minimum of 24 months postoperatively.
RESULTS: After simple randomization, 26 shoulders were allocated in the DCR+RCR 
group, and 32 were placed in the isolated RCR group. Five shoulders in the 
DCR+RCR group and 6 in the isolated RCR group were excluded from analysis due to 
loss of follow-up. Therefore, the evaluation was performed for 21 shoulders in 
the DCR+RCR group and 26 shoulders in the isolated RCR group. The mean follow-up 
period was 44.2 months in the DCR+RCR group and 44.0 months in the isolated RCR 
group. There were no differences in age, sex, symptom duration, RC tear size, or 
preoperative ASES, Constant, and VAS scores between the 2 groups (P > .05). At 
final follow-up, there were no differences in ASES, Constant, and VAS scores 
between the 2 groups (P > .05), and there was no difference in residual ACJ 
tenderness (7 in the DCR+RCR group and 5 in the isolated RCR group) between the 
2 groups (P = .270).
CONCLUSION: DCR was not more effective on the ASES score than isolated RCR in 
patients with symptomatic ACJ arthritis and RC tears.",spin,4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.6528523564338684, 'probability': 0.5205588340759277}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00022968991834204644, 'probability': 0.9997703433036804}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.46414780616760254, 'probability': 0.6286706328392029}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00026353701832704246, 'probability': 0.999736487865448}]",4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -1.1814991235733032, 'probability': 0.306818425655365}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0002703301142901182, 'probability': 0.9997296929359436}]",4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -1.1474908590316772, 'probability': 0.3174322545528412}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0005341533687897027, 'probability': 0.9994659423828125}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.2693556547164917, 'probability': 0.2810126543045044}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.000380324519937858, 'probability': 0.9996197819709778}]"

Delayed initiation of neuroprotective agents has hindered earlier phase 3 trials of neuroprotective agents.

Methods: We randomly assigned patients with suspected stroke to receive either intravenous magnesium sulfate or placebo, beginning within 2 hours after symptom onset. A loading dose was initiated by paramedics before the patient arrived at the hospital, and a 24-hour maintenance infusion was started on the patient's arrival at the hospital. The primary outcome was the degree of disability at 90 days, as measured by scores on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater disability).

Results: Among the 1700 enrolled patients (857 in the magnesium group and 843 in the placebo group), the mean (±SD) age was 69±13 years, 42.6% were women, and the mean pretreatment score on the Los Angeles Motor Scale of stroke severity (range, 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater motor deficits) was 3.7±1.3.

To increase the likelihood that good alignment will be achieved during surgery, smart tools such as robotics or patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) have been introduced.
Questions/purposes:В We hypothesized that UKA performed with PSI would result in improved level gait as ascertained with three-dimensional analysis, implant positioning, and patient-reported outcomes measured by a validated scoring system when compared with conventional instrumentation 3 months and 1 year after surgery.
Methods:В We randomized 60 patients into two groups using either the PSI technique or a conventional technique. All patients were operated on using the same technique and the same cemented metal-backed implant. Mean age of the patients was 63 В± 4 years (range, 54-72 years) and mean body mass index was 28 В± 3 kg/m(2). Patients were evaluated preoperatively, at 3 months, and 1 year after surgery by an independent observer blind to the type of technique. Gait parameters were assessed with three-dimensional analysis during level walking preoperatively and at 1 year, frontal and sagittal position of the implant was evaluated on full-length radiographs at 3 months, and subjective functional outcome and quality of life using routine questionnaires (SF-12, new Knee Society Score [KSS], Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) at 3 months and 1 year. This study had 80% power to detect a 15% difference in walking speed at the p < 0.05 level.
Results:В One year after surgery, there were no differences between the two groups in the analyzed gait spatiotemporal parameters, respectively, for PSI UKA and conventional UKA : double limb support 31% (25%-54%) versus 30% (23%-56%; p = 0.67) and walking speed (1.59 m/s [0.86-1.87 m/s] versus 1.57 m/s [0.71-1.96 m/s]; p = 0.41). No difference was observed between the two groups in terms of lower limb alignment (PSI group 178В° В± 3В°, conventional group 178В° В± 4В°; p = 0.24) or implant positioning on mediolateral and anteroposterior radiographs. There were no differences in the functional score between the PSI and conventional TKA groups at 3 months and 1 year after surgery: KSS objective knee scores (PSI: 85 В± 8 points at 3 months, 87 В± 5 points at 1 year and conventional instrumentation: 82 В± 8 points at 3 months 83 В± 6 points at 1 year; p = 0.10) and functional activity scores were similar in both group (PSI: 71 В± 12 points at 3 months and 74 В± 7 points at 1 year versus conventional group: 73 В± 11 points at 3 months and 75 В± 6 at 1 year; p = 0.9).

defined. This trial was performed to assess the feasibility and safety of 
controlled resuscitation (CR) versus standard resuscitation (SR) in hypotensive 
trauma patients.
METHODS: Patients were enrolled and randomized in the out-of-hospital setting. 
Nineteen emergency medical services (EMS) systems in the Resuscitation Outcome 
Consortium participated. Eligible patients had an out-of-hospital systolic blood 
pressure (SBP) of 90 mm Hg or lower. CR patients received 250 mL of fluid if 
they had no radial pulse or an SBP lower than 70 mm Hg and additional 250-mL 
boluses to maintain a radial pulse or an SBP of 70 mm Hg or greater. The SR 
group patients received 2 L initially and additional fluid as needed to maintain 
an SBP of 110 mm Hg or greater. The crystalloid protocol was maintained until 
hemorrhage control or 2 hours after hospital arrival.
RESULTS: A total of 192 patients were randomized (97 CR and 95 SR). The CR and 
SR groups were similar at baseline. The mean (SD) crystalloid volume 
administered during the study period was 1.0 L (1.5) in the CR group and 2.0 L 
(1.4) in the SR group, a difference of 1.0 L (95% confidence interval [CI],

defined. This trial was performed to assess the feasibility and safety of 
controlled resuscitation (CR) versus standard resuscitation (SR) in hypotensive 
trauma patients.
METHODS: Patients were enrolled and randomized in the out-of-hospital setting. 
Nineteen emergency medical services (EMS) systems in the Resuscitation Outcome 
Consortium participated. Eligible patients had an out-of-hospital systolic blood 
pressure (SBP) of 90 mm Hg or lower. CR patients received 250 mL of fluid if 
they had no radial pulse or an SBP lower than 70 mm Hg and additional 250-mL 
boluses to maintain a radial pulse or an SBP of 70 mm Hg or greater. The SR 
group patients received 2 L initially and additional fluid as needed to maintain 
an SBP of 110 mm Hg or greater. The crystalloid protocol was maintained until 
hemorrhage control or 2 hours after hospital arrival.
RESULTS: A total of 192 patients were randomized (97 CR and 95 SR). The CR and 
SR groups were similar at baseline. The mean (SD) crystalloid volume 
administered during the study period was 1.0 L (1.5) in the CR group and 2.0 L 
(1.4) in the SR group, a difference of 1.0 L (95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.6-1.4). Intensive care unit-free days, ventilator-free days, renal injury, and

there were 5 deaths (5%) in the CR group and 14 (15%) in the SR group (adjusted 
odds ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.12-1.26). Among patients with blunt trauma, 24-hour 
mortality was 3% (CR) and 18% (SR) with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.17 
(0.03-0.92). There was no difference among patients with penetrating trauma (9% 
vs. 9%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.93; 95% CI, 0.19-19.17).

types of burns, and numerous dressing materials are available for their 
treatment. A multicenter, open, randomized, and parallel study was undertaken to 
determine the efficacy and tolerability of silver sulfadiazine (SSD) compared 
with an absorbent foam silver dressing, Mepilex Ag, on patients aged between 5 
years and 65 years with deep partial-thickness thermal burn injuries (2.5-25% 
total body surface area).
METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to either SSD (n = 82) applied daily or 
a Mepilex Ag dressing (n = 71) applied every 5 days to 7 days. The treatment 
period was up to 4 weeks.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups 
with respect to the primary end point of time to healing, which occurred in 56 
(79%) of 71 patients after a median follow-up time of 15 days in the Mepilex Ag 
group compared with 65 (79%) of 82 patients after a median follow-up time of 16 
days in the SSD group (p = 0.74). There was also no significant difference in 
the percentage of study burn healed. Patients in the Mepilex Ag group had 87.1% 
of their study burn healed (out of the total burn area) compared with 85.2% of 
patients in the SSD group. However, the mean total number of dressings used was 
significantly more in the SSD group (14.0) compared with the Mepilex Ag group 
(3.06, p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in the time until skin 
graft was performed between the two study groups.
CONCLUSION: There was no difference in healing rates between Mepilex Ag and SSD,

undisturbed healing and makes it easier for patients to continue with their 
normal lives sooner.",no_spin,7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -0.7586199641227722, 'probability': 0.46831223368644714}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00026973424246534705, 'probability': 0.9997302293777466}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.5258475542068481, 'probability': 0.5910542011260986}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00032550760079175234, 'probability': 0.9996744990348816}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.007434606552124, 'probability': 0.36515456438064575}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00024720950750634074, 'probability': 0.9997527599334717}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.7000332474708557, 'probability': 0.4965687692165375}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0002696150622796267, 'probability': 0.9997304081916809}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.9330644607543945, 'probability': 0.3933464586734772}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0008106521563604474, 'probability': 0.9991896748542786}]"

compare the outcome of non-lateralized versus lateralized RSA with particular 
regard to rotational function in patients with CTA.
METHODS: Thirty-four patients underwent implantation of RSA either with 
lateralization (nВ =В 17) or without lateralization (nВ =В 17) by use of a 1-cm 
autologous bone graft (""bony increased offset"") of the humeral head for CTA.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term results of primary ACL reconstruction using 
either an allograft or autograft.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: From June 2002 to August 2003, patients with a symptomatic 
ACL-deficient knee were randomized to receive either a hamstring autograft or 
tibialis posterior allograft. All allografts were from a single tissue bank, 
aseptically processed, and fresh-frozen without terminal irradiation. Graft 
fixation was identical in all knees. All patients followed the same 
postoperative rehabilitation protocol, which was blinded to the therapists. 
Preoperative and postoperative assessments were performed via examination and/or

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was 
conducted to investigate the effects of 5 minutes of 80-Hz vibration applied 
daily after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair for 6 months on postoperative 
rotator cuff healing. The primary outcome was ultrasound-assessed repair

of intra-articular hip disorders. While most arthroscopic hip procedures are 
performed as outpatient surgeries, patients can still experience significant 
postoperative pain and opioid-associated side effects.
PURPOSE: The potential benefits of a preoperative femoral nerve block (FNB) in 
hip arthroscopy were explored in a previous retrospective review. The study 
objective was to confirm these findings in a prospective randomized study.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: Fifty patients undergoing hip arthroscopy were included in this 
prospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial that was patient-, 
operator-, and assessor-blinded. Patients received either a preoperative 
ultrasound-guided FNB with 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine (FNB group) or normal 
saline (control group). Nerve blockade was confirmed via standardized sensory 
testing before the induction of general anesthesia. The primary endpoint was 
cumulative consumption of oral morphine equivalent at 24 hours after discharge. 
Secondary endpoints included opioid use at various time points, pain scores, 
Quality of Recovery (QoR-27) score, incidence of nausea and vomiting, time to 
discharge, block-related complications, falls at 24 hours, and patient 
satisfaction.
RESULTS: Fifty patients completed the study, including 27 in the FNB group and 
23 in the control group. Most patient characteristics were statistically similar 
between groups except for operative time, which was longer in the control group. 
Cumulative oral morphine consumption was lower in the FNB group at 48 hours; 
there was no difference at 24 hours or 7 days postoperatively. Pain scores were 
significantly lower up to 6 hours postoperatively in the FNB group compared with 
control; however, rebound pain was observed at 24 hours after discharge in 
patients who received FNB. There was no difference in most secondary outcomes. 
Importantly, a total of 6 patients in the FNB group reported falls (without 
injury) within the first 24 hours postoperatively compared with none in the 
control group. Patient satisfaction with pain control was high in both groups at 
all time points.

RESULTS: There was no difference in time to reach в‰¤34 В°C between Rhinochill and

However, there are few well-designed studies comparing approaches to treatment.

Questions/purposes: (1) Which treatment (compression bandaging with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], aspiration, or aspiration with steroid injections) is associated with the highest likelihood of resolution of nonseptic olecranon bursitis? (2) Which treatment is associated with earliest resolution of symptoms? (3) What factors are associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks?

Methods: We enrolled 133 patients from two centers; after applying prespecified exclusions (septic bursitis or concomitant inflammatory arthritis, intraarticular elbow pathology, recent aspiration or steroid injection done elsewhere, and refusal to participate), 90 patients were randomly allocated to receive compression bandaging with NSAIDs (C), aspiration (A), or aspiration with steroid injection (AS) groups (30 patients in each). The groups were similar at baseline in terms of age and gender. Seven patients (four from Group A and three from Group AS) were lost to followup. All patients were followed up weekly for 4 weeks, and the same treatment procedure was repeated if the bursitis recurred with any substantial fluid collection. At 4 weeks, the state of resolution and pain visual analog scale (VAS) were evaluated. Failed resolution was defined as presence of persistent olecranon bursal fluid collection at Week 4 after the initiation of the treatment; on the contrary, if bursal fluid collection was clinically reduced or completely disappeared by the end of Week 4, the treatment was considered successful. We compared the proportion of resolution by Week 4 and the median times to resolution among the treatment groups. In addition, we evaluated whether the resolution affected pain VAS and what factors were associated with the resolution.

Results: There were no differences in the proportion of patients whose bursitis resolved by Week 4 among the three treatment groups (Group C: 25 of 30 [83%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.27-1.72], p = 0.580; Group A: 17 of 26 [65%], relative risk of resolution failure: 2.19 [95% CI, 0.98-4.87], p = 0.083; Group AS: 23 of 27 [85%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.59 [95% CI, 0.22-1.63], p = 0.398) (p = 0.073). Steroid injection after aspiration (Group AS) was associated with the earliest resolution (2.3 weeks [range, 1-4 weeks]) when compared with aspiration alone (Group A; 3.1 weeks [range, 2-4 weeks]) and compression bandaging with NSAIDs (Group C; 3.2 weeks [range, 2-4 weeks]), p = 0.015). Longer duration of symptoms before treatment was the only factor associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks (failed resolution: 6 weeks [range, 2-9 weeks]; successful resolution: 4 weeks [range, 0.4-6 weeks]; p = 0.008).

Conclusions: With the numbers available, there were no differences in efficacy when compression bandaging with NSAIDs, aspiration, and aspiration with steroid injection were compared. However, we were powered only to detect a 30% difference, meaning that if there were a smaller difference in efficacy among the groups, we might not have detected it in a study of this size. Our data can be used as pilot data to power future prospective (and likely multicenter) trials. Because olecranon bursitis can recur, and because treatments like aspiration and aspiration with steroid injection can cause complications, unless future trials demonstrate clear efficacy advantages of aspiration and/or injection both at short and longer terms, we suggest that compression bandaging and a short course of NSAIDs may offer the most appropriate balance of safety and efficacy.",no_spin,4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.8926639556884766, 'probability': 0.40956324338912964}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0003967689990531653, 'probability': 0.999603271484375}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.794277012348175, 'probability': 0.45190781354904175}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0009230881696566939, 'probability': 0.999077320098877}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.1818740367889404, 'probability': 0.3067034184932709}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0005856229108758271, 'probability': 0.9994146227836609}]",I would score 2 out of 10.,2,"[{'token': 40, 'token_string': 'I', 'logits': -1.403801679611206, 'probability': 0.24566125869750977}, {'token': 1053, 'token_string': ' would', 'logits': -0.15805606544017792, 'probability': 0.8538018465042114}, {'token': 5573, 'token_string': ' score', 'logits': -0.6983106136322021, 'probability': 0.4974249303340912}, {'token': 220, 'token_string': ' ', 'logits': -1.100708246231079, 'probability': 0.33263543248176575}, {'token': 17, 'token_string': '2', 'logits': -0.9664105176925659, 'probability': 0.3804461359977722}, {'token': 704, 'token_string': ' out', 'logits': -0.33090969920158386, 'probability': 0.718269944190979}, {'token': 315, 'token_string': ' of', 'logits': -7.033323527139146e-06, 'probability': 0.9999929666519165}, {'token': 220, 'token_string': ' ', 'logits': -7.033323527139146e-06, 'probability': 0.9999929666519165}, {'token': 605, 'token_string': '10', 'logits': -1.1920928244535389e-07, 'probability': 0.9999999403953552}, {'token': 13, 'token_string': '.', 'logits': -0.08588195592164993, 'probability': 0.9177025556564331}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.49149492383003235, 'probability': 0.6117112040519714}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.161929726600647, 'probability': 0.31288182735443115}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0019251639023423195, 'probability': 0.9980767369270325}]"

However, there are few well-designed studies comparing approaches to treatment.

Questions/purposes: (1) Which treatment (compression bandaging with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], aspiration, or aspiration with steroid injections) is associated with the highest likelihood of resolution of nonseptic olecranon bursitis? (2) Which treatment is associated with earliest resolution of symptoms? (3) What factors are associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks?

Methods: We enrolled 133 patients from two centers; after applying prespecified exclusions (septic bursitis or concomitant inflammatory arthritis, intraarticular elbow pathology, recent aspiration or steroid injection done elsewhere, and refusal to participate), 90 patients were randomly allocated to receive compression bandaging with NSAIDs (C), aspiration (A), or aspiration with steroid injection (AS) groups (30 patients in each). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients whose bursitis resolved by Week 4. Secondary outcomes included time to resolution, pain visual analog scale (VAS), and factors associated with treatment failure. The groups were similar at baseline in terms of age and gender. Seven patients (four from Group A and three from Group AS) were lost to followup. All patients were followed up weekly for 4 weeks, and the same treatment procedure was repeated if the bursitis recurred with any substantial fluid collection. At 4 weeks, the state of resolution and pain visual analog scale (VAS) were evaluated. Failed resolution was defined as presence of persistent olecranon bursal fluid collection at Week 4 after the initiation of the treatment; on the contrary, if bursal fluid collection was clinically reduced or completely disappeared by the end of Week 4, the treatment was considered successful. We compared the proportion of resolution by Week 4 and the median times to resolution among the treatment groups. In addition, we evaluated whether the resolution affected pain VAS and what factors were associated with the resolution.

Results: There were no differences in the proportion of patients whose bursitis resolved by Week 4 among the three treatment groups (Group C: 25 of 30 [83%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.27-1.72], p = 0.580; Group A: 17 of 26 [65%], relative risk of resolution failure: 2.19 [95% CI, 0.98-4.87], p = 0.083; Group AS: 23 of 27 [85%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.59 [95% CI, 0.22-1.63], p = 0.398) (p = 0.073). Time to resolution was 2.3 weeks (range, 1-4 weeks) for Group AS, 3.1 weeks (range, 2-4 weeks) for Group A, and 3.2 weeks (range, 2-4 weeks) for Group C (p = 0.015). Longer duration of symptoms before treatment was associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks (failed resolution: 6 weeks [range, 2-9 weeks]; successful resolution: 4 weeks [range, 0.4-6 weeks]; p = 0.008).

Conclusions: Compression bandaging with NSAIDs was not more effective than aspiration or aspiration with steroid injection in patients with nonseptic olecranon bursitis for the primary outcome of resolution by 4 weeks.",spin,4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -1.0145083665847778, 'probability': 0.36258062720298767}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00030083899036981165, 'probability': 0.9996991753578186}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.9277439117431641, 'probability': 0.3954448699951172}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0008397151832468808, 'probability': 0.9991605877876282}]",I would rate the importance of this study as a 6 out of 10.,6,"[{'token': 40, 'token_string': 'I', 'logits': -1.2840359210968018, 'probability': 0.276917427778244}, {'token': 1053, 'token_string': ' would', 'logits': -0.04658094421029091, 'probability': 0.9544872641563416}, {'token': 4478, 'token_string': ' rate', 'logits': -0.030475223436951637, 'probability': 0.9699844121932983}, {'token': 279, 'token_string': ' the', 'logits': -0.006715704221278429, 'probability': 0.9933068156242371}, {'token': 12939, 'token_string': ' importance', 'logits': -0.0036100472789257765, 'probability': 0.9963964819908142}, {'token': 315, 'token_string': ' of', 'logits': -5.960462772236497e-07, 'probability': 0.999999463558197}, {'token': 420, 'token_string': ' this', 'logits': -0.31326189637184143, 'probability': 0.7310583591461182}, {'token': 4007, 'token_string': ' study', 'logits': -3.576278118089249e-07, 'probability': 0.9999996423721313}, {'token': 439, 'token_string': ' as', 'logits': -0.5790398716926575, 'probability': 0.5604362487792969}, {'token': 264, 'token_string': ' a', 'logits': -0.07072946429252625, 'probability': 0.931713879108429}, {'token': 220, 'token_string': ' ', 'logits': -0.00412779301404953, 'probability': 0.995880663394928}, {'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.13014644384384155, 'probability': 0.8779668807983398}, {'token': 704, 'token_string': ' out', 'logits': -0.4302860498428345, 'probability': 0.6503230333328247}, {'token': 315, 'token_string': ' of', 'logits': -1.1920922133867862e-06, 'probability': 0.9999987483024597}, {'token': 220, 'token_string': ' ', 'logits': -3.6954811548639555e-06, 'probability': 0.9999962449073792}, {'token': 605, 'token_string': '10', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}, {'token': 13, 'token_string': '.', 'logits': -0.00035065223346464336, 'probability': 0.9996494054794312}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.09806479513645172, 'probability': 0.9065901637077332}]","I would score my interest in reading the full text article as a 2.

256,26467810,Radiological outcomes in a randomized trial comparing opening wedge and closing wedge techniques of high tibial osteotomy.,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy",  Other,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Purpose: The aim of the present study was to examine changes in radiological variables in a prospective randomized study comparing opening wedge (OW) and closing wedge (CW) techniques of high tibial osteotomy (HTO). Our hypothesis was that there would be no differences in joint line angles or correction accuracy between the two groups, that patellar height would increase after CW HTO and decrease after OW HTO, and that leg length and posterior tibial slope would decrease after CW HTO and increase after OW HTO.

Methods: Radiological data were collected from 70 patients participating in an ongoing prospective randomized clinical trial comparing OW and CW HTOs. Digital standing hip-knee-ankle (HKA) radiographs as well as lateral radiographs in 30Ў of flexion were obtained preoperatively and at 6 months for each patient. Joint line angles, HKA angle, leg length, Insall-Salvati index, Miura-Kawamura index and posterior tibial slope were measured using medical planning software. The complete preoperative radiological examinations of the first 50 patients were used in a study of intra- and inter-rater reliability of the measurements.

Results: The mean posterior slope was reduced by 2.5Ў in CW HTO, whereas it remained unchanged in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Mean leg length decreased 5.7 mm in CW HTO and increased 3.1 mm in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Changes in joint line angles, patellar height indexes and the correction accuracy showed no significant differences comparing the two techniques. Frontal plane reliability measurement intra- and inter-rater intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) varied from 0.81 to 0.99. Sagittal plane intra- and inter-rater ICC varied from 0.60 to 0.87. Posterior tibial slope intra- and inter-rater ICC showed the lowest values (0.70 and 0.60, respectively) corresponding to a smallest real difference of 4.5Ў and 5.5Ў, respectively.

Conclusions: Posterior tibial slope and leg length changes were significantly different in CW compared to OW HTOs. We recommend that possible alterations in tibial slope and leg length are considered when the technique of HTO is to be chosen. Landmark-based medical planning software shows good reliability and can be used in preoperative planning and postoperative evaluations of HTOs.",no_spin,6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.8434895277023315, 'probability': 0.43020665645599365}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0002978596603497863, 'probability': 0.9997022151947021}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.7371557950973511, 'probability': 0.47847285866737366}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0002698534226510674, 'probability': 0.999730110168457}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.9410003423690796, 'probability': 0.3902372717857361}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00026472879108041525, 'probability': 0.9997352957725525}]",4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -1.1494641304016113, 'probability': 0.31680649518966675}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00039664984797127545, 'probability': 0.9996035099029541}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.9884556531906128, 'probability': 0.3721509277820587}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0003972456615883857, 'probability': 0.9996028542518616}]"

170,26507526,Combined Administration of Systemic and Topical Tranexamic Acid for Total Knee Arthroplasty: Can It Be a Better Regimen and Yet Safe? A Randomized Controlled Trial.,The Journal of Arthroplasty,,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Background:В Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is associated with substantial blood loss in postoperative period. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is potent antifibrinolytic agent, routinely administered by intravenous (IV) and topical route, which can possibly interrupt cascade of events due to hemostatic irregularities close to source of bleeding. However, scientific evidence of combined administration of TXA in TKA is still meagre. The present study aimed to compare efficacy of combined IV and topical TXA with IV use alone in terms of blood loss, transfusion rate, and incidence of deep vein thrombosis and thromboembolism.
Patients and methods:В 119 patients undergoing unilateral TKA were randomized into IV alone and combined group. Patients assigned to IV group were given IV TXA as a preoperative and postoperative dose given 3 and 6 hours after surgery, whereas in combined group, topical TXA solution was applied intraarticularly about 5 minutes before closure of arthrotomy in addition to IV doses.
Results:В Combined use of IV and topical TXA provided better results than IV use alone with mean calculated total blood loss (590.69В±191.1 vs 385.68В±182.5, P<.001), blood transfusion rate (6.6% vs 1.6%, P = .364), hemoglobin drop (1.82В±0.6 vs 1.14В±0.5, P<.001).

171,26507526,Combined Administration of Systemic and Topical Tranexamic Acid for Total Knee Arthroplasty: Can It Be a Better Regimen and Yet Safe? A Randomized Controlled Trial.,The Journal of Arthroplasty,,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Background: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is associated with substantial blood loss in postoperative period. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is potent antifibrinolytic agent, routinely administered by intravenous (IV) and topical route, which can possibly interrupt cascade of events due to hemostatic irregularities close to source of bleeding. However, scientific evidence of combined administration of TXA in TKA is still meagre. The present study aimed to compare combined IV and topical TXA with IV use alone in patients undergoing TKA.
Patients and methods: 119 patients undergoing unilateral TKA were randomized into IV alone and combined group. The primary outcome was calculated total blood loss. Patients assigned to IV group were given IV TXA as a preoperative and postoperative dose given 3 and 6 hours after surgery, whereas in combined group, topical TXA solution was applied intraarticularly about 5 minutes before closure of arthrotomy in addition to IV doses.
Results: Mean calculated total blood loss was 590.69±191.1 in the IV group vs 385.68±182.5 in the combined group (P<.001). Blood transfusion rate was 6.6% vs 1.6% (P = .364). Hemoglobin drop was 1.82±0.6 vs 1.14±0.5 (P<.001). No case of DVT or TE was noted among the 2 study groups.

Objective: To test the hypothesis that high-intensity endurance training (ET) is superior to moderate-intensity ET for improving risk factors for type 2 diabetes in overweight adolescents.

Design and methods: In this randomized trial, 106 overweight and obese adolescents (15.2 years; 76% female; 62% Caucasian) were randomly assigned to high-intensity ET (70-85% of heart rate reserve, n=38), moderate-intensity ET (40-55% heart rate reserve; n=32) or control for 6 months (n=36).

reliable operation in terms of pain relief and return of function. However, 
during the needling process, a cuff defect is created. Little is known about the 
evolution of this defect.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial to 
investigate the evolution of the aforementioned defect and the role of 
platelet-rich plasma (PRP) augmentation in this healing process. Patients were 
randomized to either group 1 (PRP, nвЂ‰=вЂ‰20) or group 2 (no PRP [control group], 
nвЂ‰=вЂ‰20). Patients in group 1 received a perioperative PRP infiltration at the 
rotator cuff defect, whereas the control group did not. Patients were assessed 
clinically preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and 1 
year. The Constant score, Simple Shoulder Test, and QuickDASH (short version of 
Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire) were used as outcome 
measures. The evolution of the cuff defect was evaluated on sonography at 3 and 
6 months and with magnetic resonance imaging after 1 year.
RESULTS: All patients improved significantly after surgery (PвЂ‰<вЂ‰.05). There was 
no difference in clinical outcome or rotator cuff healing between groups. We 
observed a high rate of persistent rotator cuff defects after 1 year in both 
groups. The presence of residual cuff defects did not influence the clinical 
outcome.
CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic needling is an operation with a predictive, good

reliable operation in terms of pain relief and return of function. However, 
during the needling process, a cuff defect is created. Little is known about the 
evolution of this defect.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial to 
investigate the evolution of the aforementioned defect and the role of 
platelet-rich plasma (PRP) augmentation in this healing process. The primary 
outcome was rotator cuff healing. Patients were randomized to either group 1 
(PRP, n = 20) or group 2 (no PRP [control group], n = 20). Patients in group 1 
received a perioperative PRP infiltration at the rotator cuff defect, whereas 
the control group did not. Patients were assessed clinically preoperatively and 
postoperatively at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and 1 year. The Constant score, 
Simple Shoulder Test, and QuickDASH (short version of Disabilities of the Arm, 
Shoulder and Hand questionnaire) were used as secondary outcome measures. The 
evolution of the cuff defect was evaluated on sonography at 3 and 6 months and 
with magnetic resonance imaging after 1 year.
RESULTS: There was no difference in rotator cuff healing between groups. We 
observed a high rate of persistent rotator cuff defects after 1 year in both 
groups. There was no difference in clinical outcome between groups. The presence 
of residual cuff defects did not influence the clinical outcome.

Methods: Participants (n = 53) completed a randomized dietary intervention and consumed either a LF diet (25% fat) or PC diet (33% fat) for 6 weeks. Fat taste thresholds (lowest detectable fat concentration), fat perception (discrimination ability), preference, and anthropometry were assessed at baseline and week 6.

Results: Consumption of a LF diet (n = 26) and PC diet (n = 27) reduced participants' weight (P < 0.001), with no significant differences between groups (LF, -2.9%, PC, -2.7%). Both diets resulted in a decrease in fat taste thresholds (P = 0.014), and the effect tended to be stronger in the LF diet vs. the PC diet (P = 0.060).

This study assessed the effect of a 6-week low-fat (LF) or portion control (PC) diet matched for weight loss on fat taste thresholds, fat perception, and preference in people with overweight/obesity.

Methods: Participants (n = 53) completed a randomized dietary intervention and consumed either a LF diet (25% fat) or PC diet (33% fat) for 6 weeks. Fat taste thresholds (lowest detectable fat concentration), fat perception (discrimination ability), preference, and anthropometry were assessed at baseline and week 6.

Results: Consumption of a LF diet (n = 26) and PC diet (n = 27) reduced participants' weight (P < 0.001), with no significant differences between groups (LF, -2.9%, PC, -2.7%). Both diets resulted in a decrease in fat taste thresholds (P = 0.014), with no significant difference between the LF diet and PC diet (P = 0.060). The ability to perceive different fat concentrations in foods was increased after the LF diet only (P = 0.017); however, food preference did not change on either diet.

It delays mobilization, increases opioid consumption and side effects, and lengthens hospitalization. This challenge multiplies when treating an opioid-dependent population. We examined whether a novel suspended release local anesthetic, liposomal bupivacaine (LB) would improve pain control and decrease opioid consumption after TKA compared to a standard periarticular injection in opioid-dependent patients.

Methods: Thirty-eight patients undergoing TKA were randomly assigned to receive either a periarticular injection (PAI) with LB (n = 20) or with a standard PAI (including a combination of ropivacaine, clonidine, Toradol, Epinepherine, and saline; n = 18) as part of a multimodal pain management approach. All periarticular injections were done by a single surgeon. Perioperative treatment was similar between groups. Postoperative information regarding pain level was evaluated by a pain visual analog scale score. Postoperative opioid consumption was recorded.

Results: After controlling baseline narcotic usage before surgery, no differences were found between groups in daily postoperative narcotic usage (P = .113), average daily pain score (P = .332), or maximum daily pain score (P = .881). However, when examining pain levels separately for each day, pain visual analog scale scores were reported higher in post operative day 1 in the LB group (P = .033).

functional scores (P > .05). The mean follow-up period was 25.9 В± 1.2 months. 
Significant improvements in functional and pain scores were observed in both 
groups at the last follow-up visit. However, no significant differences in 
functional scores and ROM were found between the 2 groups at each time point, 
except that group 2 had significantly lower VAS pain scores (P < .05) at 3, 6, 
and 12 months postoperatively. Eight (17%) of 48 patients in group 1 and 6 (18%) 
of 34 patients in group 2 showed retears on MRI at 12-month follow-up (P > .05).

double-row repair were effective in improving clinical outcomes in the treatment 
of delaminated rotator cuff tears. Lower pain scores were seen in patients who

METHODS: One hundred twenty patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff 
repair with SLBC lesions (biceps partial tears <50%, partial pulley lesions, and 
type II SLAP lesions) were enrolled in this prospective comparative study and 
randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups (simple debridement [Deb], biceps 
tenotomy only [BTo], or biceps tenodesis with one suture anchor [BTd]). Patients 
with isolated subscapularis tears or osteoarthritis were excluded. Finally, 86 
patients (Deb in 28, BTo in 27, and BTd in 31) were analyzed (mean follow-up, 
22.1 ± 7.72 months; mean age, 58.98 ± 7.8 years). Pain; functional, clinical,

receive (42) or not receive (41) a deep intra-articlular drain. First-stage 
revisions for treating periprosthetic infection were excluded. Patients were 
statistically compared for demographic parameters, early complications and early

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination of intravenous (IV) and topical tranexamic acid (TXA) in revision THA.

Methods: Eighty-four consecutive patients undergoing revision THA were randomized into combined group and IV-TXA group. Patients in the combined group were given intravenously 15 mg/kg TXA as a preoperative, and topical TXA solution was applied at a concentration of 3 g TXA per 100-mL saline during the different procedure points. Patients in the IV-TXA group were given intravenously 15 mg/kg TXA alone.

Results: The mean total blood loss, drainage volume, and maximum hemoglobin drop were significantly lower in the combined group than the IV-TXA group (P < .001, P < .001, P < .001, respectively). Compared with the IV-TXA group, the amount of blood transfusions and number of blood transfusions required were decreased dramatically in the combined group (P = .027, P < .001, respectively). One deep vein thrombosis and 4 calf muscular vein thrombosis in the combined group and 3 calf muscular vein thrombosis in the IV-TXA were detected by the Doppler ultrasound. No pulmonary embolism was observed and no significant differences were found in other complications between the 2 groups.

Conclusion: This study showed that combined administration of IV and topical TXA in revision THA can effectively decrease total blood loss and number of blood transfusions required without increasing the risk of deep vein thrombosis or/and pulmonary embolism compared with IV-TXA alone.",no_spin,8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.6911834478378296, 'probability': 0.5009828209877014}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00016425691137555987, 'probability': 0.999835729598999}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.8251572847366333, 'probability': 0.4381660521030426}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00029666791670024395, 'probability': 0.9997034072875977}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.9843744039535522, 'probability': 0.3736729323863983}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00021705655672121793, 'probability': 0.9997829794883728}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.3344722986221313, 'probability': 0.26329708099365234}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0003013156820088625, 'probability': 0.9996986985206604}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.8662082552909851, 'probability': 0.4205431044101715}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0002882065309677273, 'probability': 0.999711811542511}]"

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination of intravenous (IV) and topical tranexamic acid (TXA) in revision THA.

Methods: Eighty-four consecutive patients undergoing revision THA were randomized into combined group and IV-TXA group. The primary outcome was total blood loss. Patients in the combined group were given intravenously 15 mg/kg TXA as a preoperative, and topical TXA solution was applied at a concentration of 3 g TXA per 100-mL saline during the different procedure points.

established as a standard treatment for large full-thickness cartilage defects, 
the effect of different doses of autologous chondrocyte products on structural 
outcomes has never been examined.
HYPOTHESIS: In ACI, the dose level may have an influence on medium-term magnetic 
resonance morphological findings after treatment.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: A total of 75 patients who underwent ACI using a pure, autologous, 
third-generation matrix-associated ACI product were divided into 3 groups 
representing different doses: 3 to 7 spheroids/cm(2), 10 to 30 spheroids/cm(2), 
and 40 to 70 spheroids/cm(2). Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 1.5, 
3, 6, and 12 months after ACI and was evaluated by the magnetic resonance 
observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score and the Knee injury and 
Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS).
RESULTS: MOCART scores showed improvements after 3 months, with slight dose 
dependence, and further improvement after 12 months, although without 
significant dose dependence. The mean MOCART scores after 3 months (0 = worst, 
100 = best) were 59.8, 64.5, and 64.7 for the low-, medium-, and high-dose 
groups, respectively, and 62.9 for all patients; at 12 months, these were 74.1, 
74.5, and 68.8 for the respective dose groups and 72.4 for all patients. Several 
MOCART items (surface of repair tissue, structure of repair tissue, signal 
intensity of repair tissue, subchondral bone, and synovitis) showed a more rapid 
response with the medium and high doses than with the low dose, suggesting a 
potential dose relationship. No significant correlation between the MOCART 
(overall and subscores) with clinical outcomes as assessed by the overall KOOS 
was detected at 3- and 12-month assessments.
CONCLUSION: This study reveals a trend toward earlier recovery after treatment 
with higher spheroid doses in terms of better defect filling for full-thickness 
cartilage defects of the knee, while outcomes after 12 months were similar in 
all dose groups. However, a correlation with clinical outcomes or the failure 
rate at 1 year after ACI was not found. A longer follow-up will be required for 
more definite conclusions on the clinical relevance of ACI cell density to be 
drawn.

patients is under debate.
PURPOSE: To compare clinical outcomes and calf muscle strength recovery after 
the nonsurgical treatment and open surgical repair of acute Achilles tendon 
ruptures with identical accelerated rehabilitation programs.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: From 2009 to 2013, a total of 60 patients with an acute Achilles tendon 
rupture were randomized to surgery or nonsurgical treatment. Nonsurgical 
treatment included first a week of cast immobilization, followed by a functional 
orthosis for 6 weeks, allowing full weightbearing after week 1 and active 
plantar flexion after week 5. Surgery was simple end-to-end open repair, and 
postoperative treatment was identical to nonsurgical treatment. The primary outcome 
was the Leppilahti Achilles tendon performance score. Secondary outcomes included 
isokinetic calf muscle strength and RAND 36-Item Health Survey at 18-month follow-up.
RESULTS: At 18-month follow-up, the mean Leppilahti score was 79.5 and 75.7 for 
the surgically and nonsurgically treated groups, respectively (mean difference, 
3.8; 95% CI, -1.9 to 9.5; P = .19). Angle-specific peak torque results of 
affected legs at 18 months showed a 14% difference in the peak torque of the 
affected leg favoring the surgical group versus the nonsurgical group (mean peak 
torque, 110.3 vs 96.5 N·m, respectively; mean difference, 13.6 N·m; 95% CI, 
2.0-25.1 N·m; P = .022). The RAND 36-Item Health Survey indicated differences 
in the domains of physical functioning (P = .006) and bodily pain (P = .037) 
for surgically treated patients.
CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment was not more effective than nonsurgical treatment

142,27307495,A Prospective Randomized Trial Comparing Surgical and Nonsurgical Treatments of Acute Achilles Tendon Ruptures.,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,,"""Trend toward significance"" // ""Numerically longer survival"" or equivalent verbiage",Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment of acute Achilles tendon ruptures for active 
patients is under debate.
PURPOSE: To compare clinical outcomes and calf muscle strength recovery after 
the nonsurgical treatment and open surgical repair of acute Achilles tendon 
ruptures with identical accelerated rehabilitation programs.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: From 2009 to 2013, a total of 60 patients with an acute Achilles tendon 
rupture were randomized to surgery or nonsurgical treatment. Nonsurgical 
treatment included first a week of cast immobilization, followed by a functional 
orthosis for 6 weeks, allowing full weightbearing after week 1 and active 
plantar flexion after week 5. Surgery was simple end-to-end open repair, and 
postoperative treatment was identical to nonsurgical treatment. Outcome measures 
included the Leppilahti Achilles tendon performance score, isokinetic calf 
muscle strength, and RAND 36-Item Health Survey at 18-month follow-up.
RESULTS: At 18-month follow-up, the mean Leppilahti score was 79.5 and 75.7 for 
the surgically and nonsurgically treated groups, respectively (mean difference, 
3.8; 95% CI, -1.9 to 9.5; P = .19). Angle-specific peak torque results of 
affected legs showed that surgery resulted in faster and better recovery of calf 
muscle strength over the entire range of motion of the ankle joint: at 6 months, 
the difference varied from 16% to 24% (P = .016), favoring the surgically 
treated group, whereas at 18 months, surgically treated patients had 10% to 18% 
greater strength results (P = .037). At 18 months, a 14% difference in the peak 
torque of the affected leg favored the surgical group versus the nonsurgical 
group (mean peak torque, 110.3 vs 96.5 NВ·m, respectively; mean difference, 13.6 
NВ·m; 95% CI, 2.0-25.1 NВ·m; P = .022). The RAND 36-Item Health Survey indicated 
better results in the domains of physical functioning (P = .006) and bodily pain 
(P = .037) for surgically treated patients.
CONCLUSION: Surgical and nonsurgical treatments of acute Achilles tendon 
ruptures have similar results in terms of the Achilles tendon performance score, 
but surgery restores calf muscle strength earlier over the entire range of 
motion of the ankle joint, with a 10% to 18% strength difference favoring 
surgery at 18 months. Surgery may also result in better health-related quality 
of life in the domains of physical functioning and bodily pain compared with 
nonsurgical treatment.

239,27339124,No Difference in Early Analgesia Between Liposomal Bupivacaine Injection and Intrathecal Morphine After TKA.,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,  Other,"""Trend toward significance"" // ""Numerically longer survival"" or equivalent verbiage",Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Background: Opioid analgesics have been a standard modality for postoperative pain management after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) but are also associated with increased risk of nausea, pruritus, vomiting, respiratory depression, prolonged ileus, and cognitive dysfunction. There is still a need for a method of anesthesia that can deliver effective long-term postoperative pain relief without incurring the high cost and health burden of opioids and nerve blocks.

Questions/purposes: (1) Is liposomal bupivacaine-based periarticular injection (PAI) more effective than morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA? (2) Do patients treated with liposomal bupivacaine-based PAI experience fewer opioid-related adverse events compared with patients treated with morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA?

Methods: This multicenter, blind trial randomized 119 patients undergoing TKA with spinal anesthesia to receive spinal anesthesia plus periarticular injection with liposomal bupivacaine (40 patients), spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine plus intrathecal morphine (41 patients) but no liposomal bupivacaine injection, or spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine (38 patients) and no liposomal bupivacaine injection. The two groups that did not receive periarticular liposomal bupivacaine did receive periarticular injection with ropivacaine, and all three groups had ketorolac (30 mg) plus epinephrine (1:1000) in the periarticular injections. Patients in all three groups received identical perioperative multimodal analgesic and antiemetic drugs. All patients were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized and no patients were lost to followup. The primary study endpoints were visual analog score (VAS) for pain and narcotic use during postoperative day 1. Secondary endpoints included side effects associated with narcotic administration during the hospital stay.

Results: Mean VAS pain in the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group was lower than that for the ropivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (1.8 ± 2.1 versus 3.3 ± 2.3, p = 0.005, mean difference: 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-2.5) and 12 hours (1.5 ± 2.0 versus 3.3 ± 2.4, p < 0.001, mean difference: 1.8, 95% CI, 0.8-2.8) after surgery. The morphine spinal group had lower pain compared with the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (0.9 ± 1.8 versus 1.8 ± 2.1, p = 0.035, mean difference: 1.0, 95% CI, 0.1-1.8), but there was no difference at 12 hours (0.8 ± 1.5 versus 1.5 ± 2.0, p = 0.086, mean difference: 0.7, 95% CI, -0.1 to 1.5). The magnitude of the differences at 6 and 12 hours are near the lower end of minimal clinically important differences reported in the literature, and thus the improvement shown in this study may only represent a small clinical improvement. Both the liposomal bupivacaine group (13% [five of 40]) and the ropivacaine group (5% [two of 38]) had fewer incidents of itching (pruritus) than the spinal morphine group (38% [15 of 41]) (p = 0.001).

238,27339124,No Difference in Early Analgesia Between Liposomal Bupivacaine Injection and Intrathecal Morphine After TKA.,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,  Other,"""Trend toward significance"" // ""Numerically longer survival"" or equivalent verbiage",Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Background: Opioid analgesics have been a standard modality for postoperative pain management after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) but are also associated with increased risk of nausea, pruritus, vomiting, respiratory depression, prolonged ileus, and cognitive dysfunction. There is still a need for a method of anesthesia that can deliver effective long-term postoperative pain relief without incurring the high cost and health burden of opioids and nerve blocks.

Questions/purposes: (1) Is liposomal bupivacaine-based periarticular injection (PAI) more effective than morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA? (2) Do patients treated with liposomal bupivacaine-based PAI experience fewer opioid-related adverse events compared with patients treated with morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA?

Methods: This multicenter, blind trial randomized 119 patients undergoing TKA with spinal anesthesia to receive spinal anesthesia plus periarticular injection with liposomal bupivacaine (40 patients), spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine plus intrathecal morphine (41 patients) but no liposomal bupivacaine injection, or spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine (38 patients) and no liposomal bupivacaine injection. The two groups that did not receive periarticular liposomal bupivacaine did receive periarticular injection with ropivacaine, and all three groups had ketorolac (30 mg) plus epinephrine (1:1000) in the periarticular injections. Patients in all three groups received identical perioperative multimodal analgesic and antiemetic drugs. All patients were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized and no patients were lost to followup. The primary study endpoints were visual analog score (VAS) for pain and narcotic use during postoperative day 1. Secondary endpoints included side effects associated with narcotic administration during the hospital stay.

Results: Mean VAS pain in the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group was lower than that for the ropivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (1.8 ± 2.1 versus 3.3 ± 2.3, p = 0.005, mean difference: 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-2.5) and 12 hours (1.5 ± 2.0 versus 3.3 ± 2.4, p < 0.001, mean difference: 1.8, 95% CI, 0.8-2.8) after surgery. The morphine spinal group had lower pain compared with the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (0.9 ± 1.8 versus 1.8 ± 2.1, p = 0.035, mean difference: 1.0, 95% CI, 0.1-1.8), but there was no difference at 12 hours (0.8 ± 1.5 versus 1.5 ± 2.0, p = 0.086, mean difference: 0.7, 95% CI, -0.1 to 1.5). The magnitude of the differences at 6 and 12 hours are near the lower end of minimal clinically important differences reported in the literature, and thus the improvement shown in this study may only represent a small clinical improvement. Both the liposomal bupivacaine group (13% [five of 40]) and the ropivacaine group (5% [two of 38]) had fewer incidents of itching (pruritus) than the spinal morphine group (38% [15 of 41]) (p = 0.001).

Conclusions: This prospective multicenter three-arm blind randomized controlled trial showed potentially improved pain control at 6 and 12 hours in the liposomal bupivacaine and intrathecal morphine groups compared with the ropivacaine group at the cost of much higher incidences of pruritus (itching) in the intrathecal morphine group. Based on these results, we prefer the use of PAI with liposomal bupivacaine as an alternative to spinal anesthesia with intrathecal morphine as a result of similar postoperative pain control and the potential for reducing adverse events.",no_spin,7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -0.7327917814254761, 'probability': 0.48056545853614807}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00041976699139922857, 'probability': 0.9995803236961365}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.498028963804245, 'probability': 0.6077273488044739}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0006023023161105812, 'probability': 0.999397873878479}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.8498187065124512, 'probability': 0.4274923801422119}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00036137725692242384, 'probability': 0.9996387362480164}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.6603363156318665, 'probability': 0.5166775584220886}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00023731753753963858, 'probability': 0.9997627139091492}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -1.0965229272842407, 'probability': 0.33403047919273376}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.000339569611242041, 'probability': 0.9996605515480042}]"

(DB) ACLR with a hamstring tendon autograft versus irradiated allograft are 
rare.
PURPOSE: To compare the clinical outcomes of arthroscopic anatomic DB ACLR with 
a hamstring tendon autograft versus irradiated allograft.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: Between 2008 and 2009, a total of 107 patients undergoing arthroscopic 
DB ACLR were prospectively randomized consecutively into 1 of 2 groups 
(autograft [Auto] group and irradiated allograft [Ir-Allo] group). All the 
surgical procedures were performed by the same senior surgeon using the DB 
reconstruction technique. All irradiated hamstring tendon allografts were 
sterilized with 2.5 Mrad of irradiation before distribution and were obtained 
from a single certified tissue bank. Graft fixation on the femoral side was by 
an Endobutton, and on the tibial side by a bioabsorbable interference screw 
augmented with a staple. The same rehabilitation protocol was applied to all 
patients. Before surgery and at a mean of 6.9 years of follow-up, patients were 
evaluated by the same observer according to objective and subjective clinical 
evaluations including detailed history, physical examination, radiography, 
functional knee ligament testing, KT-2000 arthrometer testing, Harner vertical 
jump and Daniel 1-legged hop tests, Lysholm score, Tegner score, International 
Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) standard evaluation form, and Cincinnati 
knee score.
RESULTS: A total of 83 patients (Auto: n = 40 [mean age, 29.2 ± 6.9 years]; 
Ir-Allo: n = 43 [mean age, 28.6 ± 7.2 years]) fulfilled follow-up and clinical 
evaluations. No significant differences were found between the 2 groups

patients in the Ir-Allo group also had a shorter operation time. There were 
10.0% (4/40) of patients in the Auto group and 32.6% (19/43) of patients in the 
Ir-Allo group who had arthritic progression (P < .05).

241,27528611,No Effects of Early Viscosupplementation After Arthroscopic Partial Meniscectomy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,  Focus on (+) secondary endpoint,,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: The management of the postoperative period after knee arthroscopic 
surgery may be challenging because surgical trauma deeply alters the joint 
microenvironment, causing the release of several catabolic molecules and 
proinflammatory factors that might slow down functional recovery. The 
possibility of using hyaluronic acid (HA) to promote postoperative pain relief 
and expedite functional improvement seems attractive, considering its biological 
properties.
PURPOSE: The aim of the present double-blind randomized controlled trial was to 
evaluate the effects, in terms of pain control and functional recovery, provided 
by a single HA injection performed at the end of arthroscopic meniscectomy.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: A total of 90 patients, 18 to 55 years old, were included according to 
the following criteria: (1) chronic, symptomatic meniscal tears requiring 
partial resection; (2) a healthy contralateral knee; (3) no previous surgery on 
the index knee; and (4) no other concurrent articular lesions requiring surgical 
treatment (eg, cartilage or ligament injuries). Patients were randomized into 2 
treatment groups: one underwent meniscectomy alone, whereas the other also 
received an injection of 3 mL HA at the end of the procedure. The primary 
outcomes were pain control and functional recovery. All patients were 
evaluated at baseline and then at 15, 30, 60, and 180 days using the following 
tools: International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective, Knee injury 
and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, VAS 
for general health status, and Tegner scores. The transpatellar circumference 
and active and passive ranges of motion were also recorded during the follow-up 
evaluations.
RESULTS: No major adverse events were reported using HA postoperatively. No 
significant intergroup difference was documented at any follow-up evaluation for 
any of the clinical scores. No difference was observed in the objective 
measurements. The mean time to return to full sports activity was not different 
between groups, and a comparable satisfaction rate was recorded in both 
treatment groups.

240,27528611,No Effects of Early Viscosupplementation After Arthroscopic Partial Meniscectomy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,  Focus on (+) secondary endpoint,,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: The management of the postoperative period after knee arthroscopic 
surgery may be challenging because surgical trauma deeply alters the joint 
microenvironment, causing the release of several catabolic molecules and 
proinflammatory factors that might slow down functional recovery. The 
possibility of using hyaluronic acid (HA) to promote postoperative pain relief 
and expedite functional improvement seems attractive, considering its biological 
properties.
PURPOSE: The aim of the present double-blind randomized controlled trial was to 
evaluate the effects, in terms of pain control and functional recovery, provided 
by a single HA injection performed at the end of arthroscopic meniscectomy.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: A total of 90 patients, 18 to 55 years old, were included according to 
the following criteria: (1) chronic, symptomatic meniscal tears requiring 
partial resection; (2) a healthy contralateral knee; (3) no previous surgery on 
the index knee; and (4) no other concurrent articular lesions requiring surgical 
treatment (eg, cartilage or ligament injuries). Patients were randomized into 2 
treatment groups: one underwent meniscectomy alone, whereas the other also 
received an injection of 3 mL HA at the end of the procedure. All patients were 
evaluated at baseline and then at 15, 30, 60, and 180 days using the following 
tools: International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective, Knee injury 
and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, VAS 
for general health status, and Tegner scores. The transpatellar circumference 
and active and passive ranges of motion were also recorded during the follow-up 
evaluations.
RESULTS: No major adverse events were reported using HA postoperatively. A 
statistically significant increase in all the clinical scores was reported in 
both treatment groups, but no significant intergroup difference was documented 
at any follow-up evaluation. No difference was observed also in the objective 
measurements. The mean time to return to full sports activity was not different 
between groups, and a comparable satisfaction rate was recorded in both 
treatment groups.
CONCLUSION: Early postoperative viscosupplementation did not provide significant 
clinical benefits after arthroscopic meniscectomy. Despite the lack of major 
adverse events, the administration of a single HA injection at the end of the 
surgical procedure is not a successful strategy to provide either faster 
functional recovery or symptomatic improvement after meniscectomy.",no_spin,4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.9665341377258301, 'probability': 0.3803991675376892}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00019441144831944257, 'probability': 0.9998056292533875}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.5073882341384888, 'probability': 0.6020659804344177}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00018976318824570626, 'probability': 0.9998102188110352}]",4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -1.0321292877197266, 'probability': 0.35624760389328003}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0002455409849062562, 'probability': 0.9997544288635254}]",4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -1.0957391262054443, 'probability': 0.3342924416065216}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0004159538948442787, 'probability': 0.9995841383934021}]",Score: 2,2,"[{'token': 10793, 'token_string': 'Score', 'logits': -1.072040319442749, 'probability': 0.3423093855381012}, {'token': 25, 'token_string': ':', 'logits': -1.4066597032069694e-05, 'probability': 0.9999859929084778}, {'token': 220, 'token_string': ' ', 'logits': -2.3841855067985307e-07, 'probability': 0.9999997019767761}, {'token': 17, 'token_string': '2', 'logits': -0.0847000777721405, 'probability': 0.9187877774238586}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0033532127272337675, 'probability': 0.9966524243354797}]"

anterior cup protrusion (overhang) is associated with lower outcome scores for 
pain and function.
METHODS: The current study is a reanalysis of data from a randomized controlled 
trial evaluating navigation for THA; 135 patients were randomized for surgery 
with or without the use of imageless navigation. The risk for anterior 
protrusion of the cup above the acetabular rim and thus potential psoas

RESULTS: There was no difference, with the numbers available, between the

CONCLUSIONS: We found no differences between imageless navigation and estimation

Methods: Forty-two consecutive patients scheduled for hip arthroscopy were randomized into 2 postoperative pain control groups. One group received preemptive intra-articular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection, and the second group received preemptive periacetabular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection. Before closure all patients received an additional dose of 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% intra-articularly. Data were compared with respect to postoperative pain with visual analog scale (VAS) and analgesic consumption, documented in a pain diary for 2 weeks after surgery.

Results: Twenty-one patients were treated with intra-articular injection, and 21 patients with peri-acetabular injection.

apply, and cost effective method for controlling pain after total knee 
arthroplasty (TKA). However, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a major 
concern. 5-Hydroxytryptamine receptor 3 (5-HT3) antagonists like ondansetron and 
ramosetron are commonly used for preventing PONV, but the optimal choice remains 
unclear.
METHODS: Patients were randomized preoperatively to either intravenous 
ondansetron (8 mg) or ramosetron (0.3 mg). The primary outcomes were the 
incidence rates of PONV. Secondary outcomes were the need for a rescue 
antiemetic (metoclopramide), pain score, patient satisfaction, and adverse drug 
reactions (ADRs) at 0-6, 6-12, 12-24, and 24-48 hours.
RESULTS: Ninety patients were evaluable; 45 patients/arm. Compared with 
ondansetron, ramosetron was associated with lower incidence rates 
of nausea at: (1) 12-18 hours: 3/45 vs 11/45 (P = .016), (2) 18-24 hours: 1/45 
vs 9/45 (P = .005), and vomiting at 18-24 hours: 1/45 vs 6/45 (P = .044). There

arthroplasty (TKA). However, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a major 
concern. 5-Hydroxytryptamine receptor 3 (5-HT3) antagonists like ondansetron and 
ramosetron are commonly used for preventing PONV, but the optimal choice remains 
unclear. We conducted a study to assess the effectiveness of ramosetron and 
ondansetron, hypothesizing that the longer acting ramosetron may be better than 
ondansetron in the first 48В hours after TKA, performed with spinal anesthesia 
and intrathecal morphine.
METHODS: Patients were randomized preoperatively to either intravenous 
ondansetron (8 mg) or ramosetron (0.3 mg). The primary outcomes were the 
incidence rates of PONV. Secondary outcomes were the need for a rescue 
antiemetic (metoclopramide), pain score, patient satisfaction, and adverse drug 
reactions (ADRs) at 0-6, 6-12, 12-24, and 24-48В hours.
RESULTS: Ninety patients were evaluable; 45 patients/arm. Compared with 
ondansetron, ramosetron was associated with significantly lower incidence rates 
of nausea at: (1) 12-18В hours: 3/45 vs 11/45 (PВ = .016), (2)В 18-24В hours: 1/45 
vs 9/45 (PВ = .005), and vomiting at 18-24В hours: 1/45 vs 6/45 (PВ = .044). There 
were no significant differences in the use of rescue-antiemetic medicine, pain 
score, patient satisfaction, and ADRs.
CONCLUSION: Preoperative ramosetron provided more prolonged PONV prophylaxis 
than ondansetron after TKA in our setting, and had a similar ADR profile. Other 
trials are needed to confirm our results before ramosetron is adopted widely.",no_spin,7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -0.8724555969238281, 'probability': 0.41792401671409607}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0001530530134914443, 'probability': 0.9998469352722168}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.6700142025947571, 'probability': 0.5117012858390808}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0002631794777698815, 'probability': 0.9997369050979614}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -1.0783215761184692, 'probability': 0.34016600251197815}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00017796363681554794, 'probability': 0.9998220801353455}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.7188493609428406, 'probability': 0.4873126447200775}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0001760566228767857, 'probability': 0.9998239278793335}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.6409093737602234, 'probability': 0.5268131494522095}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00019822540343739092, 'probability': 0.9998018145561218}]"

Design: A randomised controlled trial of 503 participants followed for six months.

Setting: Participants were recruited from two tertiary acute care settings in Kingston, ON, Canada.

Participants: The broad inclusion criteria were patients aged і16 presenting for acute medical assessment and treatment of a simple grade 1 or 2 ankle sprain. Exclusions were patients with multiple injuries, other conditions limiting mobility, and ankle injuries that required immobilisation and those unable to accommodate the time intensive study protocol.

Intervention: Participants received either usual care, consisting of written instructions regarding protection, rest, cryotherapy, compression, elevation, and graduated weight bearing activities, or usual care enhanced with a supervised programme of physiotherapy.

Main outcome measures: The primary outcome of efficacy was the proportion of participants reporting excellent recovery assessed with the foot and ankle outcome score (FAOS). Excellent recovery was defined as a score і450/500 at three months. A difference of at least 15% increase in the absolute proportion of participants with excellent recovery was deemed clinically important. Secondary analyses included the assessment of excellent recovery at one and six months; change from baseline using continuous scores at one, three, and six months; and clinical and biomechanical measures of ankle function, assessed at one, three, and six months.

Results: The absolute proportion of patients achieving excellent recovery at three months was not significantly different between the physiotherapy (98/229, 43%) and usual care (79/214, 37%) arms (absolute difference 6%, 95% confidence interval -3% to 15%). The observed trend towards benefit with physiotherapy did not increase in the per protocol analysis and was in the opposite direction by six months. These trends remained similar and were never statistically or clinically important when the FAOS was analysed as a continuous change score.

The reduction in pain score at 30 minutes was 4 (IQR 3 to 7) for the lidocaine group and 5 (IQR 2 to 7) for the saline solution group (median difference=1.0; 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 2.1). Need for rescue medication did not differ between the groups, and local irritation was the most common adverse event in the lidocaine group.

METHODS: A randomized double-blind controlled trial was performed in 53 patients 
with renal colic recruited from the emergency department (ED) in 2015. Finally, 
40 patients were enrolled in this study. Patients in the ketamine group received 
IN ketamine 1 mg/kg and IV placebo while patients in the control group received 
IV morphine 0.1mg/kg and IN placebo. Our goal was to assess visual analogue 
scale (VAS) changes between the 2 groups. Patients' VAS scores were reported

Methods: We conducted a single-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. One hundred one patients were randomized to receive either TXA or an equivalent volume of normal saline. The primary outcome measure was thigh swelling. Secondary outcome measures included, visual analogue pain score, timed up and go test, a 10 meter walk test, and length of stay. Blood loss and the incidence of blood transfusions were also recorded.

Results: There were no statistically significant differences between the primary outcome of thigh swelling or the secondary outcome measures of postoperative pain nor mobility. There was a significant reduction in length of stay for those that received TXA 3.58 days (0.84) compared with the control group 4.27 days (0.98) (P < .001).

the addition of MPFL reconstruction to TTT results in fewer redislocations or

METHODS: A total of 80 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair

joint precede radiographic abnormalities of posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) 
by as much as decades. A growing body of evidence strongly suggests that the 
progression from anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury to PTOA is 
multifactorial, involving the interplay between biomechanical disturbances and 
biochemical homeostasis of articular cartilage.
PURPOSE: The purposes of this randomized study using an acute ACL injury model 
were to (1) evaluate the natural progression of inflammatory and 
chondrodegenerative biomarkers, (2) evaluate the relationship between subjective 
reports of pain and inflammatory and chondrodegenerative biomarkers, and (3) 
determine if postinjury arthrocentesis and corticosteroid injection offer the 
ability to alter this biochemical cascade.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: A total of 49 patients were randomized to 4 groups: group 1 
(corticosteroid at 4 days after ACL injury, placebo injection of saline at 2 
weeks), group 2 (placebo at 4 days after ACL injury, corticosteroid at 2 weeks), 
group 3 (corticosteroid at both time intervals), or a placebo group (saline 
injections at both time intervals). Patient-reported outcome measures and 
synovial biomarkers were collected at approximately 4 days, 11 days, and 5 weeks 
after injury. The change between the time points was assessed for all variables 
using Wilcoxon tests, and the relationship between changes in outcome scores and 
biomarkers were assessed by calculating Spearman ПЃ. Outcomes and biomarkers were 
also compared between the 4 groups using Kruskal-Wallis tests.
RESULTS: No adverse events or infections were observed in any study patients. 
With the exception of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) and tumor necrosis 
factor-inducible gene 6 (TSG-6), chondrodegenerative markers worsened over the 
first 5 weeks while all patient-reported outcomes improved during this time, 
regardless of treatment group. Patient-reported outcomes did not differ between 
patients receiving corticosteroid injections and the placebo group. However, 
increases in C-telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II), associated with 
collagen type II breakdown, were significantly greater in the placebo group 
(1.32 В± 1.10 ng/mL) than in either of the groups that received the 
corticosteroid injection within the first several days after injury (group 1: 
0.23 В± 0.27 ng/mL [ P = .01]; group 3: 0.19 В± 0.34 ng/mL [ P = .01]).
CONCLUSION: PTOA begins at the time of injury and results early on in dramatic 
matrix changes in the knee. However, it is encouraging that early intervention 
with an anti-inflammatory agent was able to affect biomarkers of chondral 
degeneration. Should early intervention lead to meaningful changes in either the 
onset or severity of symptomatic PTOA, the current treatment paradigm for 
patients with ACL injury may have to be restructured to include early aspiration 
and intra-articular intervention.",no_spin,6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.7817960381507874, 'probability': 0.4575834274291992}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00030214988510124385, 'probability': 0.9996978640556335}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.8302006125450134, 'probability': 0.4359617829322815}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0002444683632347733, 'probability': 0.9997556209564209}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.9418216943740845, 'probability': 0.38991686701774597}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0002759314374998212, 'probability': 0.9997240304946899}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.202101469039917, 'probability': 0.30056193470954895}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00044050050200894475, 'probability': 0.9995596408843994}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -1.2152034044265747, 'probability': 0.29664966464042664}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0003252692404203117, 'probability': 0.9996747970581055}]"

treatment focuses on management of respiratory distress and hypoxia. High-flow 
warm humidified oxygen (HFWHO) is increasingly used, but has not been rigorously 
studied in randomised trials. We aimed to examine whether HFWHO provided 
enhanced respiratory support, thereby shortening time to weaning off oxygen.
METHODS: In this open, phase 4, randomised controlled trial, we recruited 
children aged less than 24 months with moderate bronchiolitis attending the 
emergency department of the John Hunter Hospital or the medical unit of the John 
Hunter Children's Hospital in New South Wales, Australia. Patients were randomly 
allocated (1:1) via opaque sealed envelopes to HFWHO (maximum flow of 1 L/kg per 
min to a limit of 20 L/min using 1:1 air-oxygen ratio, resulting in a maximum 
FiO2 of 0В·6) or standard therapy (cold wall oxygen 100% via infant nasal 
cannulae at low flow to a maximum of 2 L/min) using a block size of four and 
stratifying for gestational age at birth. The primary outcome was time from 
randomisation to last use of oxygen therapy. All randomised children were 
included in the primary and secondary safety analyses. This trial is registered 
with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number 
ACTRN12612000685819.
FINDINGS: From July 16, 2012, to May 1, 2015, we randomly assigned 202 children 
to either HFWHO (101 children) or standard therapy (101 children). Median time 
to weaning was 24 h (95% CI 18-28) for standard therapy and 20 h (95% CI 17-34) 
for HFWHO (hazard ratio [HR] for difference in survival distributions 0В·9 [95% 
CI 0В·7-1В·2]; log rank p=0В·61). Fewer children experienced treatment failure on 
HFWHO (14 [14%]) compared with standard therapy (33 [33%]; p=0В·0016); of these 
children, those on HFWHO were supported for longer than were those on standard 
therapy before treatment failure (HR 0В·3; 95% CI 0В·2-0В·6; p<0В·0001). 20 (61%) of 
33 children who experienced treatment failure on standard therapy were rescued 
with HFWHO. 12 (12%) of children on standard therapy required transfer to the 
intensive care unit compared with 14 (14%) of those on HFWHO (difference -1%; 
95% CI -7 to 16; p=0В·41). Four adverse events occurred (oxygen desaturation and 
condensation inhalation in the HFWHO group, and two incidences of oxygen tubing 
disconnection in the standard therapy group); none resulted in withdrawal from 
the trial. No oxygen-related serious adverse events occurred. Secondary 
effectiveness outcomes are reported in the Results section.
INTERPRETATION: HFWHO did not significantly reduce time on oxygen compared with 
standard therapy, suggesting that early use of HFWHO does not modify the 
underlying disease process in moderately severe bronchiolitis. HFWHO might have 
a role as a rescue therapy to reduce the proportion of children requiring

out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Regionalisation of care into cardiac 
arrest centres (CAC) may improve this. We report a pilot randomised trial of 
expedited transfer to a CAC following OHCA without ST-elevation. The objective 
was to assess the feasibility of performing a large-scale randomised controlled 
trial.
METHODS: Adult witnessed ventricular fibrillation OHCA of presumed cardiac cause 
were randomised 1:1 to either: (1) treatment: comprising expedited transfer to a 
CAC for goal-directed therapy including access to immediate reperfusion, or (2) 
control: comprising current standard of care involving delivery to the 
geographically closest hospital. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause 
mortality. Secondary outcomes were cerebral performance category (CPC) and 
in-hospital major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE). The 
feasibility of randomisation, protocol adherence and data collection were 
assessed.
RESULTS: Between November 2014 and April 2016, 118 cases were screened, of which 
63 patients (53%) met eligibility criteria and 40 of the 63 patients (63%) were 
randomised. There were no protocol deviations in the treatment arm. Data 
collection of primary and secondary outcomes was achieved in 83%. There was no 
difference in baseline characteristics between the groups: 30-day mortality 
(Intervention 9/18, 50% vs. Control 6/15, 40%; P=0.73), CPC 1/2 (Intervention: 
9/18, 50% vs. Control 7/14, 50%; P>0.99) or MACCE (Intervention: 9/18, 50% vs. 
Control 6/15, 40%; P=0.73).

out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Regionalisation of care into cardiac 
arrest centres (CAC) may improve this. We report a pilot randomised trial of 
expedited transfer to a CAC following OHCA without ST-elevation. The objective 
was to assess the feasibility of performing a large-scale randomised controlled 
trial.
METHODS: Adult witnessed ventricular fibrillation OHCA of presumed cardiac cause 
were randomised 1:1 to either: (1) treatment: comprising expedited transfer to a 
CAC for goal-directed therapy including access to immediate reperfusion, or (2) 
control: comprising current standard of care involving delivery to the 
geographically closest hospital. The feasibility of randomisation, protocol 
adherence and data collection of the primary (30-day all-cause mortality) and 
secondary (cerebral performance category (CPC)) and in-hospital major 
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) clinical outcome measures were 
assessed.
RESULTS: Between November 2014 and April 2016, 118 cases were screened, of which 
63 patients (53%) met eligibility criteria and 40 of the 63 patients (63%) were 
randomised. There were no protocol deviations in the treatment arm. Data 
collection of primary and secondary outcomes was achieved in 83%. There was no 
difference in baseline characteristics between the groups: 30-day mortality 
(Intervention 9/18, 50% vs. Control 6/15, 40%; P=0.73), CPC 1/2 (Intervention: 
9/18, 50% vs. Control 7/14, 50%; P>0.99) or MACCE (Intervention: 9/18, 50% vs. 
Control 6/15, 40%; P=0.73).

conducting a large-scale randomised controlled trial of expedited transfer to

techniques for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Controversy has arisen as each

management. The objective of the present study was to compare both the frequency 
of condylar liftoff and the location of femorotibial contact from extension 
through midflexion between patients undergoing GB or MR TKA.
METHODS: A total of 24 knees (23 patients) were randomly assigned at referral to 
either a surgeon performing MR or GB TKA with the same single radius, 
posterior-stabilized implant (12 per cohort). At 1-year postoperation, patients 
underwent biplanar radiographic imaging at 0В°, 20В°, 40В°, and 60В° of flexion. 
Condylar liftoff, contact location, and magnitude of excursion on each condyle 
were measured. Preoperative and postoperative clinical outcome scores were also 
collected.
RESULTS: There was no difference (PВ = .41) in the frequency of liftoff between 
cohorts. The MR cohort had more posterior contact on the medial condyle (P < 
.01) and more anterior contact on the lateral condyle (P < .01) throughout 
flexion. Motion patterns were similar between cohorts, with similar medial (PВ = 
.48) and lateral (PВ = .44) excursion, which was equal in magnitude between

patients. Outcomes included filling of the intervention and subsequent inhaled 
corticosteroid prescriptions, asthma-related symptoms and quality of life, and 
follow-up rates with a primary care provider. Outcomes were assessed during 
telephone interviews 2 and 8 weeks after the ED visit and by review of primary 
care provider and pharmacy records.
RESULTS: One hundred forty-seven children were enrolled, and baseline measures 
were similar between groups. In the intervention group, 53.5% of patients filled 
an initial ED prescription for inhaled corticosteroid. There was no important 
difference between groups in subsequent filling of a primary care provider 
prescription (21% intervention versus 17% control; relative rate=1.24; 95% 
confidence interval 0.63 to 2.41). During the 2 weeks after the ED visit, 
intervention subjects reported reduced shortness of breath while awake and cough 
while asleep compared with controls. Groups did not differ by rates of primary 
care provider follow-up, functional limitations, or asthma-related symptoms and 
quality of life.
CONCLUSION: There was no difference in the proportion of patients who filled a 
primary care provider prescription after ED initiation of an inhaled 
corticosteroid. The intervention was associated with reduced reported symptoms 
but did not affect other asthma outcomes or primary care provider follow-up.",no_spin,6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.8645725250244141, 'probability': 0.42123156785964966}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.000339569611242041, 'probability': 0.9996605515480042}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.5951371788978577, 'probability': 0.5514869093894958}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00034588552080094814, 'probability': 0.9996541738510132}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.6639188528060913, 'probability': 0.5148298144340515}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00023755589791107923, 'probability': 0.9997625350952148}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.8939131498336792, 'probability': 0.40905192494392395}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00036793138133361936, 'probability': 0.9996322393417358}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.7559899687767029, 'probability': 0.4695455729961395}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0004533693427219987, 'probability': 0.9995467066764832}]"

laparoscopic running enterotomy closure for linear stapled Roux-en-Y Gastric 
Bypass (RYGB) using unidirectional barbed sutures (Stratafixв„ў 2/0- Ethicon).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred patients undergoing laparoscopic RYGB were 
prospectively randomized regarding running enterotomy closure of the linear 
stapled gastrojejunal (GJA) and jejunojejunal anastomosis (JJA). Two groups were 
created: V-group (VicrylВ® 2/0-Ethicon) and S-group (Stratafixв„ў 2/0-Ethicon). 
Time spent on closing the enterotomies was measured from first needle in until 
knot and cut (V-group) or last stitch and cut (S-group). If needed, a 
nonabsorbable ""correction"" (""c""; in order to close a small hiatus at the 
anastomosis) or hemostatic (""h"") stitch was made (using a single ProleneВ®

RESULTS: Average total procedure time was similar (S-group 1:01:22, V-group 
1:00:44, PВ =В 0.340). Closure of the enterotomy (GJA) was significantly shorter 
in the S-group (07:41В min versus 08:13В min in the V-group, PВ =В 0.005). Extra

unpredictable. To overcome the shortcomings of the microfracture technique, 
various augmentation techniques have been developed. However, their efficacies 
remain unclear.
HYPOTHESIS: The quality of cartilage repair and clinical outcomes would be 
superior in patients undergoing high tibial osteotomy (HTO) with microfracture 
and collagen augmentation compared to those undergoing HTO with microfracture 
alone without collagen augmentation for the treatment of medial compartment 
osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.
METHODS: Twenty-eight patients undergoing HTO were randomized into 2 groups: 
microfracture alone (group 1, n = 14) or microfracture with collagen 
augmentation (group 2, n = 14). At 1 year postoperatively, second-look 
arthroscopic surgery and biopsy of repaired cartilage were performed at the time 
of HTO plate removal. Biopsy specimens were graded using the International 
Cartilage Repair Society Visual Assessment Scale II (ICRS II). In addition, 
imaging outcomes in terms of the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage 
repair tissue (MOCART) score were assessed based on magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI). Finally, clinical outcomes in terms of the visual analog scale (VAS) for 
pain score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International 
Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and Tegner activity scale score were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: The mean ICRS II score in group 2 was significantly higher than that in 
group 1 (1053.2 vs 885.4, respectively; P = .002). Group 2 showed greater 
improvement in tissue morphology, cell morphology, surface architecture, 
middle/deep zone assessment, and overall assessment compared with group 1 ( P < 
.050 for all comparisons). Imaging outcomes based on the MOCART score were 
superior in group 2 compared to those in group 1 on MRI at 1 year 
postoperatively (64.6 vs 45.4, respectively; P = .001). The degree of defect 
repair was better in group 2 than in group 1 ( P = .040). Clinical outcomes in 
terms of the VAS for pain score, KOOS, IKDC score, and Tegner activity scale 
score were improved in both groups without between-group differences ( P > .100 
for all comparisons).
CONCLUSION: The quality of cartilage repair after microfracture with collagen 
augmentation was superior to that after microfracture alone in patients

Biological analysis of PRP has demonstrated an anti-inflammatory effect on the intra-articular environment.

Purpose: To compare the clinical and biological effects of an intra-articular injection of PRP with those of an intra-articular injection of HA in patients with mild to moderate knee OA.

Study design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods: A total of 111 patients with symptomatic unilateral knee OA received a series of either leukocyte-poor PRP or HA injections under ultrasound guidance. Clinical data were collected before treatment and at 4 time points across a 1-year period. Synovial fluid was also collected for analysis of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers before treatment and at 12 and 24 weeks after treatment. Several measures were used to assess results: (1) Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale; (2) International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee evaluation, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, and Lysholm knee score; and (3) difference in intra-articular biochemical marker concentrations.

Results: There were 49 patients randomized to treatment with PRP and 50 randomized to treatment with HA. No difference was seen between the groups in the primary outcome measure (WOMAC pain score). In the secondary outcome measure, linear contrasts identified a significantly higher IKDC score in the PRP group compared with the HA group at 24 weeks (mean ± standard error [SE], 65.5 ± 3.6 vs 55.8 ± 3.8, respectively; P = .013) and at final follow-up (52 weeks) (57.6 ± 3.37 vs 46.6 ± 3.76, respectively; P = .003). Linear contrasts also identified a statistically lower VAS score in the PRP group versus the HA group at 24 weeks (mean ± SE, 34.6 ± 3.24 vs 48.6 ± 3.7, respectively; P = .0096) and 52 weeks (44 ± 4.6 vs 57.3 ± 3.8, respectively; P = .0039). An examination of fixed effects showed that patients with mild OA and a lower body mass index had a statistically significant improvement in outcomes. In the biochemical analysis, differences between groups approached significance for interleukin-1_ (mean ± SE, 0.14 ± 0.05 pg/mL [PRP] vs 0.34 ± 0.16 pg/mL [HA]; P = .06) and tumor necrosis factor _ (0.08 ± 0.01 pg/mL [PRP] vs 0.2 ± 0.18 pg/mL [HA]; P = .068) at 12-week follow-up.

Conclusion: We found no difference between HA and PRP at any time point in the primary outcome measure: the patient-reported WOMAC pain score. Significant improvements were seen in other patient-reported outcome measures, with results favoring PRP over HA. Preceding a significant difference in subjective outcomes favoring PRP, there was a trend toward a decrease in 2 proinflammatory cytokines, which suggest that the anti-inflammatory properties of PRP may contribute to an improvement of symptoms.",no_spin,7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -0.9192101359367371, 'probability': 0.3988339602947235}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00036995718255639076, 'probability': 0.9996301531791687}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.43125689029693604, 'probability': 0.6496919393539429}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0006070678355172276, 'probability': 0.999393105506897}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.214775800704956, 'probability': 0.29677653312683105}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00038258862332440913, 'probability': 0.9996175169944763}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.952558159828186, 'probability': 0.38575294613838196}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0004124982515349984, 'probability': 0.9995875954627991}]","I would score this 6 out of 10.

behavioral treatment (BT) approach that integrated skills for managing the 
obesogenic food environment (BTвЂ‰+вЂ‰E) with an approach that integrated 
environmental and acceptance-based skills (BTвЂ‰+вЂ‰EA). Moderators were examined as 
an exploratory aim.
METHODS: Adults (NвЂ‰=вЂ‰283) were randomly assigned to treatment condition and 
provided with 26 group-based sessions over the course of 12 months. Weight was 
measured in the clinic at months 0, 6, and 12.
RESULTS: Change in weight over time did not significantly differ by condition. 
However, race significantly moderated the effect of condition on weight loss 
(PвЂ‰=вЂ‰0.04), such that African-American participants lost less weight than 
non-Hispanic white participants in the BT (6.2% vs. 11.5%) and BTвЂ‰+вЂ‰E conditions 
(6.6% vs. 12.2%), but weight loss in these two groups was similar in the BTвЂ‰+вЂ‰EA 
condition (9.4% vs. 11.5%). Among African Americans, rates of achieving a 
clinically significant weight loss (i.e.,вЂ‰>вЂ‰5%) at 12 months were higher in 
BTвЂ‰+вЂ‰EA (80%) than BT (57%) or BTвЂ‰+вЂ‰E (48%) (PвЂ‰=вЂ‰0.04).

efficacy of autologous platelet-richВ plasma (PRP) injections and arthroscopic 
lateral release in treating chronic lateral epicondylitis (LE).
METHODS: Patients who had a clinical diagnosis of LE confirmed by ultrasound 
(US) were included in this study. A total of 101 patients received arthroscopic 
release (nВ = 50) or US-guided PRP injections (nВ = 51). Outcomes were assessed 
using a visual analog scale for pain, the Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation 
(PRTEE), and a calibrated hand dynamometer for grip strength.
RESULTS: Both patient groups experienced significant improvement in all 
measures. Between-group comparisons showed a significantly higher value in the 
PRP group only for grip strength at week 8 (PВ = .0073); all other significant 
differences were in favor of arthroscopy: overall pain (PВ = .0021), night pain

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) seems to achieve equal weight loss as laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), but there is still much debate about the quality of life (QOL) after LSG, mainly concerning the association with gastroesophageal reflux.

Materials and methods: Between February 2013 and February 2014, 150 patients were randomized to undergo either LSG or LRYGB in our clinic. Differences in QOL were compared between groups by using multiple QOL questionnaires at follow-up moments preoperatively and 2 and 12 months after surgery.

Results: After 12 months of follow-up, 128 patients had returned the questionnaires.

significantly. Liposomal bupivacaine (LB) is an extended-release delivery of a 
phospholipid bilayer encapsulating bupivacaine that can result in drug delivery 
up to 72 hours. Prior studies in lower extremity surgery demonstrated efficacy 
of LB in comparison to a single-shot peripheral nerve block; however, no study 
has investigated LB in a total shoulder arthroplasty population. Therefore, this 
study compared LB vs. an indwelling interscalene nerve block (IINB).
METHODS: This is a prospective, randomized study of 83 consecutive shoulder 
arthroplasty patients; 36 patients received LB and a ""bridge"" of 30 mL of 0.5% 
bupivacaine, and 47 patients received an IINB. The primary outcome was 
postoperative visual analog scale pain levels. Secondary outcomes included 
opiate consumption measured with oral morphine equivalents, length of hospital 
stay, and postoperative complications. Continuous variables were compared using 
an analysis of variance with significance set at P < .05.
RESULTS: Visual analog scale pain scores were statistically higher in the LB 
cohort immediately postoperatively in the postanesthesia care unit (7.25 vs.

Methods: Sixty morbid obese patients (BMI і 35) were evaluated before and after 12 weeks of bariatric surgery in order to compare the impact of two different exercise programs on body composition and functional capacity outcomes. Participants were divided into three groups: aerobic (A), aerobic-strength (AS), and control (C) group. Aerobic capacity was assessed with 12-min walk-run test (12MWRT).

Results: Weight, percent body fat (PBF), and fat mass (FM) reduced greater in the trial groups in comparison to the C group (P < 0.05).

(MRSA). For cellulitis without purulent drainage, ОІ-hemolytic streptococci are 
presumed to be the predominant pathogens. It is unknown if antimicrobial 
regimens possessing in vitro MRSA activity provide improved outcomes compared 
with treatments lacking MRSA activity.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 
yields a higher clinical cure rate of uncomplicated cellulitis than cephalexin 
alone.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized 
superiority trial in 5 US emergency departments among outpatients older than 12 
years with cellulitis and no wound, purulent drainage, or abscess enrolled from 
April 2009 through June 2012. All participants had soft tissue ultrasound 
performed at the time of enrollment to exclude abscess. Final follow-up was 
August 2012.
INTERVENTIONS: Cephalexin, 500 mg 4 times daily, plus 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily, for 7 days (nвЂ‰=вЂ‰248 
participants) or cephalexin plus placebo for 7 days (nвЂ‰=вЂ‰248 participants).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome determined a priori in the 
per-protocol group was clinical cure, defined as absence of these clinical 
failure criteria at follow-up visits: fever; increase in erythema (>25%), 
swelling, or tenderness (days 3-4); no decrease in erythema, swelling, or 
tenderness (days 8-10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness 
(days 14-21). A clinically significant difference was defined as greater than 
10%.
RESULTS: Among 500 randomized participants, 496 (99%) were included in the 
modified intention-to-treat analysis and 411 (82.2%) in the per-protocol 
analysis (median age, 40 years [range, 15-78 years]; 58.4% male; 10.9% had 
diabetes). Median length and width of erythema were 13.0 cm and 10.0 cm. In the 
per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 182 (83.5%) of 218 
participants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 165 
(85.5%) of 193 in the cephalexin group (difference, -2.0%; 95% CI, -9.7% to 
5.7%; PвЂ‰=вЂ‰.50). In the modified intention-to-treat population, clinical cure 
occurred in 189 (76.2%) of 248 participants in the cephalexin plus 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 171 (69.0%) of 248 in the cephalexin 
group (difference, 7.3%; 95% CI, -1.0% to 15.5%; PвЂ‰=вЂ‰.07). Between-group adverse 
event rates and secondary outcomes through 7 to 9 weeks, including overnight 
hospitalization, recurrent skin infections, and similar infection in household

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with uncomplicated cellulitis, the use 
of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared to cephalexin alone 
did not result in higher rates of clinical resolution of cellulitis in the

METHODS: The study was a single-center, randomized, double-blinded,

randomized to one of the 3 groups: IV acetaminophen group (IV group, n = 57) 
received 1 g IV acetaminophen and oral placebo before postanesthesia care unit

RESULTS: For age group 6-8, MEND/CATCH6-12 resulted in greater improvement in

RESULTS: At 12 months, there was no significant difference in %BMIp95 between 
MEND/CATCH6-12 and Next Steps for any age group. For the primary outcome at 12 months, 
effect sizes were not statistically significant across all age groups. MEND2-5 
did not differentially affect %BMIp95. Attendance averaged 52% and 22% during 
the Intensive and Transition Phases. Intervention compliance was inversely 
correlated to change in %BMIp95 during the Intensive Phase (P < 0.05). In the 
Transition Phase, %BMIp95 was maintained or rebounded in both programs 
(P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: MEND/CATCH6-12 was not more effective than Next Steps on the primary 
outcome of %BMIp95 at 12 months in underserved children.",spin,4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.9895334243774414, 'probability': 0.3717501163482666}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00026925752172246575, 'probability': 0.9997308254241943}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.095483422279358, 'probability': 0.3343779146671295}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0002456601650919765, 'probability': 0.9997543692588806}]",4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.8009052276611328, 'probability': 0.44892239570617676}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00024387246230617166, 'probability': 0.9997561573982239}]",4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.8050143718719482, 'probability': 0.4470815360546112}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0009667966514825821, 'probability': 0.9990336894989014}]",4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -1.038477897644043, 'probability': 0.3539930582046509}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0004772001120727509, 'probability': 0.999522864818573}]"

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether TTM at 33В°C for 48 hours results in better 
neurologic outcomes compared with currently recommended, standard, 24-hour TTM.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was an international, 
investigator-initiated, blinded-outcome-assessor, parallel, pragmatic, 
multicenter, randomized clinical superiority trial in 10 intensive care units 
(ICUs) at 10 university hospitals in 6 European countries. Three hundred 
fifty-five adult, unconscious patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were 
enrolled from February 16, 2013, to June 1, 2016, with final follow-up on 
December 27, 2016.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to TTM (33вЂ‰В±вЂ‰1В°C) for 48 hours (nвЂ‰=вЂ‰176) 
or 24 hours (nвЂ‰=вЂ‰179), followed by gradual rewarming of 0.5В°C per hour until

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was 6-month neurologic outcome, 
with a Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) score of 1 or 2 used to define 
favorable outcome. Secondary outcomes included 6-month mortality, including time 
to death, the occurrence of adverse events, and intensive care unit resource 
use.
RESULTS: In 355 patients who were randomized (mean age, 60 years; 295 [83%] 
men), 351 (99%) completed the trial. Of these patients, 69% (120/175) in the 
48-hour group had a favorable outcome at 6 months compared with 64% (112/176) in 
the 24-hour group (difference, 4.9%; 95% CI, -5% to 14.8%; relative risk [RR], 
1.08; 95% CI, 0.93-1.25; PвЂ‰=вЂ‰.33). Six-month mortality was 27% (48/175) in the 
48-hour group and 34% (60/177) in the 24-hour group (difference, -6.5%; 95% CI, 
-16.1% to 3.1%; RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.59-1.11; PвЂ‰=вЂ‰.19). There was no significant 
difference in the time to mortality between the 48-hour group and the 24-hour 
group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.54-1.15; PвЂ‰=вЂ‰.22). Adverse events were more 
common in the 48-hour group (97%) than in the 24-hour group (91%) (difference,

139,28844420,A prospective randomized controlled trial to identify the optimal postoperative pain management in shoulder arthroplasty: liposomal bupivacaine versus continuous interscalene catheter.,Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery,,"Claim benefit based only on efficacy, ignore safety (or vice versa)",Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Shoulder arthroplasty is the fastest growing joint replacement 
surgery in the United States, and optimal postoperative pain management is 
critical to optimize outcomes for these surgeries. Liposomal bupivacaine (LB) 
has gained popularity for its potential to provide extended postoperative pain 
relief with possibly fewer side effects. The goal of this study was to assess 
the impact of LB compared with continuous interscalene nerve block (CISB) in 
terms of postoperative pain control after shoulder arthroplasty surgery.
METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled clinical trial compared consecutive 
patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty treated with CISB vs. LB with a single 
bolus interscalene block. The primary outcome measures included pain assessment 
up to 24 hours after surgery; in addition, all doses and times of narcotics 
administered during the inpatient stay were recorded. Patient-reported outcome 
measures for pain, satisfaction, and functional outcomes were recorded 
postoperatively.
RESULTS: A total of 70 of 74 consecutive patients who underwent shoulder 
arthroplasty were included in the study. The LB group had equivalent narcotic 
use, pain scores, and time to first narcotic rescue compared with the CISB group 
within the first 24 hours (P > .05). The LB group had higher American Shoulder 
and Elbow Surgeons score and Penn Shoulder Score at final follow-up. There was

91,29077725,Ondansetron treatment reduces rotavirus symptoms-A randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial.,PLOS ONE,RESULTS: Focus on (+) secondary endpoint,,Emergency Medicine,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Rotavirus and norovirus cause acute gastroenteritis with severe 
diarrhoea and vomiting, symptoms that may lead to severe dehydration and death. 
The objective of this randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled study was to 
investigate whether ondansetron, a serotonin receptor antagonist could reduce 
the number of diarrhoea and vomiting episodes during the 24 hours following 
treatment.
METHODS: Children with acute gastroenteritis, aged 6 months to 16 years where 
enrolled (n = 104) and randomized to one single oral dose (0.15mg/kg) of 
ondansetron (n = 52) or placebo (n = 52). The primary outcome was the number of 
diarrhoea and vomiting episodes during the 24 hours following treatment. 
Secondary outcomes included the number of days with symptoms. Pathogens in 
faeces were diagnosed by real-time PCR.
RESULTS: The number of diarrhoea and vomiting episodes during the 24 hours 
following treatment was not significantly different between ondansetron and 
placebo groups. One dose of oral ondansetron reduced duration of rotavirus 
clinical symptoms (p = 0.014), with a median of two days. Furthermore, 
ondansetron reduced diarrhea episodes, most pronounced in children that had been 
sick for more than 3 days before treatment (p = 0.028).

90,29077725,Ondansetron treatment reduces rotavirus symptoms-A randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial.,PLOS ONE,RESULTS: Focus on (+) secondary endpoint,,Emergency Medicine,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Rotavirus and norovirus cause acute gastroenteritis with severe 
diarrhoea and vomiting, symptoms that may lead to severe dehydration and death. 
The objective of this randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled study was to 
investigate whether ondansetron, a serotonin receptor antagonist could attenuate 
rotavirus- and norovirus-induced vomiting and diarrhoea, which would facilitate 
oral rehydration and possibly accelerate recovery and reduce need for 
hospitalization.
METHODS: Children with acute gastroenteritis, aged 6 months to 16 years where 
enrolled (n = 104) and randomized to one single oral dose (0.15mg/kg) of 
ondansetron (n = 52) or placebo (n = 52). The number of diarrhoea and vomiting 
episodes during the 24 hours following treatment was reported as well as the 
number of days with symptoms. Pathogens in faeces were diagnosed by real-time 
PCR. Outcome parameters were analyzed for rotavirus- and norovirus-positive 
children.
RESULTS: One dose of oral ondansetron reduced duration of rotavirus clinical 
symptoms (p = 0.014), with a median of two days. Furthermore, ondansetron 
reduced diarrhea episodes, most pronounced in children that had been sick for 
more than 3 days before treatment (p = 0.028).

PURPOSE: To compare the long-term clinical outcomes provided by intra-articular 
injections of either PRP or hyaluronic acid (HA) to treat knee degenerative 
disease.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: Patients with a history of chronic symptomatic knee degenerative 
changes and osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 0-3) were enrolled: 192 
patients were randomized to undergo 3 blinded weekly intra-articular injections 
of either PRP or HA. Patients were prospectively evaluated before the injection 
and then at 2, 6, 12, and 24 months and a mean of 64.3 months (SD, 7.8 months) 
of follow-up. Evaluation was based on International Knee Documentation Committee 
(IKDC) subjective (primary outcome), EuroQol visual analog scale, and Tegner 
scores; 167 patients reached the final evaluation.
RESULTS: Mean ± SD IKDC subjective score for PRP group changed from 53.3 ± 14.3 
at baseline to 67.3 ± 18.1 at 24 months and to 60.5 ± 19.0 at final evaluation. 
Mean ± SD IKDC subjective score for HA group changed from 50.3 ± 13.2 at 
baseline to 62.1 ± 20.8 at 24 months and to 55.7 ± 18.8 at final evaluation. A 
comparative analysis showed no significant intergroup difference in any of the 
clinical scores at any follow-up point. The median duration of patient 
subjective perception of symptomatic relief was 9 months for HA and 12 months 
for PRP (not significant). The rate of reintervention at 24 months was 22.6% in 
the PRP group versus 37.1% in the HA group (P = .036).
CONCLUSION: PRP was not more effective on IKDC subjective score than HA in 
patients with knee degenerative disease.

evidence on the benefits of this technique compared with viscosupplementation, 
no studies have been performed to compare their long-term effects.
PURPOSE: To compare the long-term clinical outcomes provided by intra-articular 
injections of either PRP or hyaluronic acid (HA) to treat knee degenerative 
disease.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: Patients with a history of chronic symptomatic knee degenerative 
changes and osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 0-3) were enrolled: 192 
patients were randomized to undergo 3 blinded weekly intra-articular injections 
of either PRP or HA. Patients were prospectively evaluated before the injection 
and then at 2, 6, 12, and 24 months and a mean of 64.3 months (SD, 7.8 months) 
of follow-up. Evaluation was based on International Knee Documentation Committee 
(IKDC) subjective (main outcome), EuroQol visual analog scale, and Tegner 
scores; 167 patients reached the final evaluation.
RESULTS: Both treatments were effective in improving knee functional status and 
symptoms over time: Mean В± SD IKDC subjective score improved significantly for 
both PRP and HA groups ( P < .0005) and remained stable over time up to 24 
months (from 53.3 В± 14.3 to 67.3 В± 18.1 and from 50.3 В± 13.2 to 62.1 В± 20.8 for 
PRP and HA groups, respectively). At final evaluation, a significant IKDC 
reduction was observed in both treatment groups, with the PRP group still 
presenting significantly higher values compared with baseline: PRP 60.5 В± 19.0 ( 
P < .001 vs baseline), HA 55.7 В± 18.8 (not significant vs baseline). A 
comparative analysis showed no significant intergroup difference in any of the 
clinical scores at any follow-up point. The median duration of patient 
subjective perception of symptomatic relief was 9 months for HA and 12 months 
for PRP (not significant). The only significant difference was observed in the 
rate of reintervention at 24 months, which was significantly lower in the PRP 
group (22.6% vs 37.1%, P = .036).
CONCLUSION: Both treatments were effective in improving knee functional status 
and symptoms over time. PRP did not provide an overall superior clinical 
improvement compared with HA in terms of either symptomatic-functional 
improvement at different follow-up points or effect duration.

varieties of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) as an adjuvant to arthroscopic rotator 
cuff repair (ARCR) result in improved tendon healing rates.
PURPOSE: To perform a network meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials 
in the literature to ascertain whether there is evidence to support the use of 
LP- or LR-PRP as an adjunct to ARCR.
METHODS: The literature search was based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting

controlled trials comparing LP- or LR-PRP with a control alongside ARCR were 
included. Clinical outcomes, including retears and functional outcomes, were 
compared using a frequentist approach to network meta-analysis, with statistical 
analysis performed using R. The treatment options were ranked using the P-score.
RESULTS: There were 13 studies (868 patients) included, with 9 studies comparing 
LP-PRP with a control and 4 studies comparing LR-PRP with a control. LP-PRP was 
found to significantly reduce the rate of retear and/or incomplete tendon 
healing after fixation, even among medium-large tears; it also improved outcomes

group, except for visual analog scale score for pain. However, post hoc analysis 
revealed that LP-PRP did not lead to significant improvements over LR-PRP in any 
category.
CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrates that LP-PRP reduces the rate of
