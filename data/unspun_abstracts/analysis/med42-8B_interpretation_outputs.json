        "abstract": "Purpose\nTo determine if anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is superior to anatomic single-bundle reconstruction in restoring the stabilities and functions of the knee joint.\nMethods\nA prospective randomized clinical study was done to compare the results of 32 cases of anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction and 34 cases of anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction with average follow-up of 16.3 \u0412\u00b1 3.1\u0412\u00a0months. Tunnel placements of all the cases were measured on 3D CT. Clinical results were collected after reconstruction; graft's appearance, meniscus status and cartilage state under arthroscopy were compared and analysed too.\nResults\nTunnel placements, confirmed with 3D CT, were in the anatomic positions as described in literature both in SB and DB group. No differences were found between SB and DB groups in clinical outcome scores, pivot shift test and KT 1000\u0412\u00a0measurements (average side-to-side difference for anterior tibial translation was 0.7\u0412\u00a0mm in SB group and 1.0\u0412\u00a0mm in DB group). More than 70 % of the single-bundle graft and AM bundle graft in DB group appeared excellent, but only 44.1 % of PL bundle grafts in DB group were excellent and 11.8 % were in poor state. No new menisci tear was found either in SB or DB group, however, in DB group cartilage damages in medial patella-femoral joint occurred in 38.2 % cases. This rate was significantly higher than in the SB group which is only 9.3 %.\nConclusion\nBoth single- and double-bundle anatomic ACL reconstruction can restore the knee's stability and functions very well. However, more incidences of poor PL status and medial patellar-femoral cartilage damage may occur in double-bundle ACL reconstruction.",

Subjects were randomized to receive a 20 mL/kg infusion of either 5% \ndextrose in normal saline solution or normal saline solution. Serum ketone \nlevels were measured before and at 1- and 2-hour intervals after the initial \nstudy fluid bolus administration. Primary outcome was the proportion of children \nhospitalized. Secondary outcome was change in serum ketone levels over time.\nRESULTS: One hundred eighty-eight children were enrolled. The proportion of \nchildren hospitalized did not differ between groups (35% in the 5% dextrose in \nnormal saline solution group versus 44% in the normal saline solution group; \nrisk difference 9%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -5% to 22%). Compared with \nchildren who received normal saline solution, those who received 5% dextrose in \nnormal saline solution had a greater reduction in mean serum ketone levels at \nboth 1 hour (mean \u041e\u201d 1.2 versus 0.1 mmol/L; mean difference 1.1 mmol/L; 95% CI \n0.4 to 1.9 mmol/L) and 2 hours (mean \u041e\u201d 1.9 versus 0.3 mmol/L; mean difference \n1.6 mmol/L; 95% CI 0.9 to 2.3 mmol/L).\nCONCLUSION: Administration of a dextrose-containing bolus compared with normal \nsaline did not lead to a lower rate of hospitalization for children with \ngastroenteritis and dehydration. There was, however, a greater reduction in \nserum ketone levels in patients who received 5% dextrose in normal saline \nsolution.",

Subjects were randomized to receive a 20 mL/kg infusion of either 5% \ndextrose in normal saline solution or normal saline solution. Serum ketone \nlevels were measured before and at 1- and 2-hour intervals after the initial \nstudy fluid bolus administration. Primary outcome was the proportion of children \nhospitalized. Secondary outcome was change in serum ketone levels over time.\nRESULTS: One hundred eighty-eight children were enrolled. The proportion of \nchildren hospitalized did not differ between groups (35% in the 5% dextrose in \nnormal saline solution group versus 44% in the normal saline solution group; \nrisk difference 9%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -5% to 22%). Children who received 5% dextrose in \nnormal saline solution had a reduction in mean serum ketone levels at \nboth 1 hour (mean \u0394 1.2 versus 0.1 mmol/L; mean difference 1.1 mmol/L; 95% CI \n0.4 to 1.9 mmol/L) and 2 hours (mean \u0394 1.9 versus 0.3 mmol/L; mean difference \n1.6 mmol/L; 95% CI 0.9 to 2.3 mmol/L).\nCONCLUSION: 5% dextrose in normal saline solution was not more effective than normal saline solution on hospitalization rates in children with gastroenteritis and dehydration.",

We explore various efficacy \nmeasures for a novel F(ab)2 antivenom in patients with moderate to severe pain \ncaused by black widow spider envenomation.\nMETHODS: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, clinical trial was \nconducted in 12 academic emergency departments. We included patients at least 10 \nyears old with moderate to severe latrodectism. Subjects received either a \nsingle intravenous infusion of antivenom or placebo. Pain was assessed with the \nvisual analog scale. The primary efficacy outcome was the difference in pre- and \nposttreatment visual analog scale score. Prospectively defined secondary \noutcomes included treatment failures and time to clinically important decrease \nin pain.\nRESULTS: Twenty-four subjects were enrolled between October 2005 and October \n2006; 13 were randomized to antivenom and 11 to placebo. The median change in \nvisual analog scale at 150 minutes posttreatment was -50.0 mm (Interquartile \nRange [IQR] -67, -41 mm) in the antivenom treatment group and -46.0 mm (IQR -51, \n0 mm) in the placebo treatment group (P=.14). There were 7 treatment failures \n(64%; 95% confidence interval 35% to 92%) in the placebo group and 3 (23%; 95% \nconfidence interval 0.2% to 46%) in the antivenom group (P=.06). The median time \nto a clinically important decrease in pain after treatment was shorter in the \nantivenom group compared with the placebo group (30 minutes [IQR 30, 60 minutes] \nversus 90 minutes [IQR 30, 90 minutes]; P=.03). No serious adverse events or \ndeaths were reported.\nCONCLUSION: Although the overall reduction in pain was similar for antivenom- \nand placebo-treated subjects, antivenom reduced pain more rapidly than placebo. \nNo significant adverse events occurred in either group.",

We evaluate the efficacy of a novel F(ab)2 antivenom in patients with moderate to severe pain \ncaused by black widow spider envenomation.\nMETHODS: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, clinical trial was \nconducted in 12 academic emergency departments. We included patients at least 10 \nyears old with moderate to severe latrodectism. Subjects received either a \nsingle intravenous infusion of antivenom or placebo. Pain was assessed with the \nvisual analog scale. The primary efficacy outcome was the difference in pre- and \nposttreatment visual analog scale score. Prospectively defined secondary \noutcomes included treatment failures and time to clinically important decrease \nin pain.\nRESULTS: Twenty-four subjects were enrolled between October 2005 and October \n2006; 13 were randomized to antivenom and 11 to placebo. The median change in \nvisual analog scale at 150 minutes posttreatment was -50.0 mm (Interquartile \nRange [IQR] -67, -41 mm) in the antivenom treatment group and -46.0 mm (IQR -51, \n0 mm) in the placebo treatment group (P=.14). There were 7 treatment failures \n(64%; 95% confidence interval 35% to 92%) in the placebo group and 3 (23%; 95% \nconfidence interval 0.2% to 46%) in the antivenom group (P=.06). The median time \nto a clinically important decrease in pain after treatment was 30 minutes (IQR 30, 60 minutes) \nin the antivenom group and 90 minutes (IQR 30, 90 minutes) in the placebo group (P=.03). No serious adverse events or \ndeaths were reported.\nCONCLUSION: The antivenom was not more effective on the primary outcome of pain reduction than placebo in patients with moderate to severe black widow spider envenomation.",

Subjects were randomly assigned to usual care or one of 3 prescription information or services intervention groups: (1) practical services to reduce barriers to prescription filling (practical prescription information or services); (2) consumer drug information from MedlinePlus (MedlinePlus prescription information or services); or (3) both services and information (combination prescription information or services). Self-reported medication adherence, measured by primary adherence (prescription filling) and persistence (receiving medicine as prescribed) rates, was determined during a telephone interview 1 week postdischarge.\n\nResults: Of the 3,940 subjects enrolled and randomly allocated to treatment, 86% (N=3,386) completed the follow-up interview. Overall, primary adherence was 88% and persistence was 48%. Across the sites, primary adherence and persistence did not differ significantly between usual care and the prescription information or services groups. However, at site C, subjects who received the practical prescription information or services (odds ratio [OR]=2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4 to 4.3) or combination prescription information or services (OR=1.8; 95% CI 1.1 to 3.1) were more likely to fill their prescription compared with usual care. Among subjects prescribed a drug that treats an underlying condition, subjects who received the practical prescription information or services were more likely to fill their prescription (OR=1.8; 95% CI 1.0 to 3.1) compared with subjects who received usual care.\n\nConclusion: Prescription filling and receiving medications as prescribed was not meaningfully improved by offering patients patient-centered prescription information and services.",

Despite intensive marketing by the manufacturers, this claim has not yet been confirmed in a controlled prospective trial.\n\nQuestions/purposes: We (1) compared three-planar component alignment and overall coronal mechanical alignment between PSG and conventional instrumentation and (2) logged the need for applying changes in the suggested position of the PSG.\n\nMethods: In this randomized controlled trial, we enrolled 128 patients. The primary outcome was overall coronal mechanical alignment. Secondary outcomes included femoral coronal alignment, femoral axial alignment, tibial coronal alignment, and tibial sagittal alignment. In the PSG cohort, surgical navigation was used as an intraoperative control. When the suggested cut deviated more than 3\u00b0 from target, the use of PSG was abandoned and marked as an outlier. When cranial-caudal position or size was adapted, the PSG was marked as modified. All patients underwent long-leg standing radiography and CT scan. Deviation of more than 3\u00b0 from the target in any plane was defined as an outlier.\n\nResults: The PSG and conventional cohorts showed similar numbers of outliers in overall coronal alignment (25% versus 28%; p = 0.69). There were more outliers in tibial coronal (15% versus 3%; p = 0.03) and sagittal (21% versus 3%; p = 0.002) alignment in the PSG group than in the conventional group. The PSG group showed similar outlier rates for femoral coronal alignment (7% versus 14%; p = 0.24) and femoral axial alignment (23% versus 17%; p = 0.50). PSGs were abandoned in 14 patients (22%) and modified in 18 (28%).\n\nConclusions: PSGs were not more effective than conventional instrumentation for overall coronal mechanical alignment in patients undergoing TKA.",

Inclusion criteria were patients undergoing chest, \nabdominal, or pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan with intravenous contrast, \nolder than 18 years, and at least one contrast-induced nephropathy risk factor. \nExclusion criteria were end-stage renal disease, pregnancy, N-acetylcysteine \nallergy, or clinical instability. Intervention for the treatment group was \nN-acetylcysteine 3 g in 500 mL normal saline solution as an intravenous bolus \nand then 200 mg/hour (67 mL/hour) for up to 24 hours; and for the placebo group \nwas 500 mL normal saline solution and then 67 mL/hour for up to 24 hours. The \nprimary outcome was contrast-induced nephropathy, defined as an increase in \ncreatinine level of 25% or 0.5 mg/dL, measured 48 to 72 hours after CT.\nRESULTS: The data safety and monitoring board terminated the study early for \nfutility. Of 399 patients enrolled, 357 (89%) completed follow-up and were \nincluded. The N-acetylcysteine plus saline solution group contrast-induced \nnephropathy rate was 14 of 185 (7.6%) versus 12 of 172 (7.0%) in the normal \nsaline solution only group (absolute risk difference 0.6%; 95% confidence \ninterval -4.8% to 6.0%).\nCONCLUSION: N-acetylcysteine plus normal saline solution was not more effective than normal saline solution alone in the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy in patients undergoing contrast-enhanced CT.",

Inclusion criteria were patients undergoing chest, \nabdominal, or pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan with intravenous contrast, \nolder than 18 years, and at least one contrast-induced nephropathy risk factor. \nExclusion criteria were end-stage renal disease, pregnancy, N-acetylcysteine \nallergy, or clinical instability. Intervention for the treatment group was \nN-acetylcysteine 3 g in 500 mL normal saline solution as an intravenous bolus \nand then 200 mg/hour (67 mL/hour) for up to 24 hours; and for the placebo group \nwas 500 mL normal saline solution and then 67 mL/hour for up to 24 hours. The \nprimary outcome was contrast-induced nephropathy, defined as an increase in \ncreatinine level of 25% or 0.5 mg/dL, measured 48 to 72 hours after CT.\nRESULTS: The data safety and monitoring board terminated the study early for \nfutility. Of 399 patients enrolled, 357 (89%) completed follow-up and were \nincluded. The N-acetylcysteine plus saline solution group contrast-induced \nnephropathy rate was 14 of 185 (7.6%) versus 12 of 172 (7.0%) in the normal \nsaline solution only group (absolute risk difference 0.6%; 95% confidence \ninterval -4.8% to 6.0%). The contrast-induced nephropathy rate in patients \nreceiving less than 1 L intravenous fluids in the emergency department (ED) was \n19 of 147 (12.9%) versus 7 of 210 (3.3%) for greater than 1 L intravenous fluids \n(difference 9.6%; 95% confidence interval 3.7% to 15.5%), a 69% risk reduction \n(odds ratio 0.41; 95% confidence interval 0.21 to 0.80) per liter of intravenous \nfluids.\nCONCLUSION: We did not find evidence of a benefit for N-acetylcysteine \nadministration to our ED patients undergoing contrast-enhanced CT. However, we \ndid find a significant association between volume of intravenous fluids \nadministered and reduction in contrast-induced nephropathy.",

        "abstract": "Background: Many resuscitation scenarios include the use of emergency intubation to support injured patients. New video-guided airway management technology is available, which may minimize the risk to patients from this procedure.\n\nMethods: This was a controlled clinical trial conducted in the trauma receiving unit in a university-affiliated urban hospital in which 623 consecutive adult patients requiring emergency airway management were prospectively randomized to intubation with either the direct laryngoscope (DL) or the GlideScope video laryngoscope (GVL) device. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes included intubation duration, first-pass success, and incidence of low oxygen saturations.\n\nResults: There was no significant difference in mortality between the GVL group (28 [9%] of 303) and the DL group (24 [8%] of 320) (p = 0.43). Median intubation duration in seconds was significantly higher for the GVL group (median, 56; interquartile range, 40-81) than for the DL group (median, 40; interquartile range, 24-68) (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between the two groups in first-pass success (80% for GVL and 81% for DL, p = 0.46). In a subgroup of patients with severe head injuries (head Abbreviated Injury Scale [AIS] score > 3), there was a higher mortality rate in those randomized to intubation with GVL (22 [30%] of 73) versus DL (16 [14%] of 112) (p = 0.047). Among those with severe head injuries, median intubation duration in seconds was also significantly higher for the GVL group (median, 74) than for the DL group (median, 65) (p < 0.003). This group also experienced a greater incidence of low oxygen saturations of 80% or less (27 [50%] of 54 for the GVL group and 15 [24%] of 63 for the DL group; p = 0.004).\n\nConclusion: The GlideScope video laryngoscope was not more effective on survival to hospital discharge than direct laryngoscopy in adult patients requiring emergency airway management.",

        "abstract": "Background: Many resuscitation scenarios include the use of emergency intubation to support injured patients. New video-guided airway management technology is available, which may minimize the risk to patients from this procedure.\n\nMethods: This was a controlled clinical trial conducted in the trauma receiving unit in a university-affiliated urban hospital in which 623 consecutive adult patients requiring emergency airway management were prospectively randomized to intubation with either the direct laryngoscope (DL) or the GlideScope video laryngoscope (GVL) device.\n\nResults: The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. There was no significant difference in mortality between the GVL group (28 [9%] of 303) and the DL group (24 [8%] of 320) (p = 0.43) for all patients. Within a smaller cohort identified retrospectively, there was a higher mortality rate seen in the subgroup of patients with severe head injuries (head Abbreviated Injury Scale [AIS] score > 3) who were randomized to intubation with GVL (22 [30%] of 73) versus DL (16 [14%] of 112) (p = 0.047). Among all patients, median intubation duration in seconds was significantly higher for the GVL group (median, 56; interquartile range, 40-81) than for the DL group (median, 40; interquartile range, 24-68) (p < 0.001). Among those with severe head injuries, median intubation duration in seconds was also significantly higher for the GVL group (median, 74) than for the DL group (median, 65) (p < 0.003). Correspondingly, this group also experienced a greater incidence of low oxygen saturations of 80% or less (27 [50%] of 54 for the GVL group and 15 [24%] of 63 for the DL group; p = 0.004). There were no significant differences between the two groups in first-pass success (80% for GVL and 81% for DL, p = 0.46).\n\nConclusion: Use of the GlideScope did not influence survival to hospital discharge among all patients and was associated with longer intubation times than direct laryngoscopy. Among the video laryngoscope cohort, a smaller subgroup of severe head injury trauma patients identified retrospectively seemed to be associated with a greater incidence of hypoxia of 80% or less and mortality.",

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of the two procedures in patients older than 55 years of age affected by reparable rotator cuff tears with concomitant long head biceps pathologies.\n\nMethods: Patients older than 55 years of age with long head biceps lesions and reparable rotator cuff tears were selected for this study. A total of 151 patients were randomly assigned to the tenotomy group (77 patients) or the tenodesis group (74 patients). Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was performed in all the patients. Before surgery, physical and radiological examinations were performed; the constant score was measured as well. After the operation, the surgical time, cost, pain (VAS scores), Popeye sign, cramping pain, constant scores, satisfaction level and the elbow flexion and forearm supination strength indices were recorded.\n\nResults: Patients were followed for an average of 24 months. No significant differences in the clinical results for the constant scores, the forearm supination and elbow flexion strength indices, Popeye sign, cramping pain and satisfaction level were found between the groups. However, tenotomy required a shorter surgical time (40.4 \u00b1 4.0 vs. 50.4 \u00b1 5.9 min, P < 0.001) and resulted in faster pain relief (3.1 \u00b1 1.8 vs. 4.8 \u00b1 1.9, P < 0.001).\n\nConclusion: Both tenotomy and tenodesis are effective and equal for the treatment of long head biceps lesions. However, because tenotomy requires a shorter surgical time and results in faster pain relief, tenotomy may be more suitable for the treatment of long head biceps lesions in patients older than 55 years of age with reparable rotator cuff tears.",

In intention-to-treat analyses, antibiotic prescribing rate, \nduration of antibiotic treatment, and number of days with impairment of daily \nactivities within 14 days of randomization were compared between the two groups.\nRESULTS: In total 337 children, mean age 3.8 years (range 0.1-18), were \nincluded. Antibiotic prescribing rates were not significantly different in PCT \nguided patients compared to controls (OR 1.26; 95% CI 0.81, 1.95). Duration \nof antibiotic exposure was reduced from 6.3 to 4.5 days under PCT guidance (-1.8 \ndays; 95% CI -3.1, -0.5; P = 0.039) for all LRTI and from 9.1 to 5.7 days for \npneumonia (-3.4 days 95% CI -4.9, -1.7; P<0.001).

However, there are unanswered questions about the performance of hemiarthroplasty over the longer term compared with internal fixation.\n\nQuestions/purposes: We sought to compare hemiarthroplasty with internal fixation in terms of (1) outcomes scores for pain, hip function, and quality of life at a minimum of 5 years after surgery in a randomized trial. A secondary purpose was to compare (2) patient survival and (3) frequency of reoperation in the two groups.\n\nMethods: A total of 222 consecutive patients older than 60 years, including those cognitively impaired, with FNF were randomized to either internal fixation with two parallel screws or bipolar hemiarthroplasty. At a minimum followup of 4.9 years (mean, 5.9 years; range, 4.9-7.2 years), 68 of the 70 surviving patients were examined by a study nurse and study physiotherapist blinded to initial treatment. Questionnaires on hip function (Harris hip score), quality of life (Eq5D), and activity of daily living function (Barthel ADL) were administered. The Barthel ADL index score was split into good function (score 95 or 100) and reduced function (score below 95).\n\nResults: The mean survival of the groups was similar with 66.4% (73 of 110) of the patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty and 70.5% (79 of 112) of the patients undergoing internal fixation having died since surgery (p = 0.51). Only 12 of 31 living patients in the internal fixation group had retained their native hips at a mean of 6 years. Between 2 and 6 years, there were two new major reoperations (both in the internal fixation group, for avascular necrosis and deep wound infection). The mean Harris hip score was 66 (SD 19) and 67 (SD 20) in the internal fixation and hemiarthroplasty groups, respectively (p = 0.96). The mean Eq5D index was 0.50 (SD 0.40) in the internal fixation group and 0.34 (SD 0.36) in the hemiarthroplasty group (p = 0.10). Function in terms of ADLs was comparable between the groups; of the patients in the internal fixation group, 42% reported good function on the Barthel ADL index, and the corresponding number in the hemiarthroplasty group was 51% (p = 0.44).\n\nConclusions: Hemiarthroplasty has predictable and good long-term results after FNF and is the treatment of choice compared with internal fixation. Further studies will evaluate if total hip arthroplasty has advantages over hemiarthroplasty in patients with fracture with long life expectancy.",

        "abstract": "Background: The infrapatellar fat pad is one of the structures that obscures exposure in minimally invasive total knee arthroplasty (MIS TKA). Most MIS TKA surgeons (and many surgeons who use other approaches as well) excise the fat pad for better exposure of the knee. There is still controversy about the result of fat pad excision on patella baja, pain, and function.\n\nQuestions/purposes: In the setting of a randomized controlled trial, we sought to determine whether infrapatellar fat pad excision during MIS TKA causes (1) patellar tendon shortening (as measured by patella baja); (2) increased anterior knee pain; (3) decreases in the Knee Society Score or functional subscore; or (4) more patella-related complications.\n\nMethods: We randomized 90 patients undergoing MIS TKA at one institution into two groups. In one group, 45 patients underwent MIS TKA with complete infrapatellar fat pad excision and in the other group, 45 patients received MIS TKA without infrapatellar fat pad excision. The patella was selectively resurfaced in these patients; there was no difference between the groups in terms of the percentage of patients whose patellae were resurfaced. We measured patellar tendon shortening, knee flexion, anterior knee pain, Knee Society Score (KSS), functional subscore, and patellar complications at preoperative and postoperative periods of 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year; complete followup data were available on 86% of patients (77 of 90) who were enrolled.\n\nResults: At the final followup, no significant differences were observed in patellar tendon shortening, KSS, functional subscore, or knee flexion in either group. However, patients with their infrapatellar fat pad excised experienced more anterior knee pain (8.3% versus 0%; p = 0.03; 95% confidence interval, -0.007 to 0.174) at the end of the study. No patellar complications were found in either group.\n\nConclusions: Infrapatellar fat pad excision in MIS TKA resulted in an increasing small percentage of patients with anterior knee pain after surgery. Surgeons should keep the fat pad if excellent exposure can be achieved but resect it if needed to improve exposure during TKA.",

All patients were blinded to their \ntreatment with placebo saline catheters. Blinded coinvestigators collected data \nconcerning side effect profiles (nausea, hypotension), analgesic efficacy (VAS \npain scores, narcotic usage), and functional recovery (timed up and go test, \nquadriceps strength, WOMAC scores, Knee Society scores, early postoperative \nambulatory ability, in-hospital falls). All complications and adverse events \nwere recorded.\nRESULTS: The frequency of nausea and hypertension was not different between the \nstudy groups. During the first 12 and 24 postoperative hours, the mean maximum \nVAS pain scores were higher in the ropivacaine group than in the epidural group \n(first 12 hours: 3.93 versus 1.14, respectively, p < 0.0001; 12-24 hours: 3.52 \nversus 1.93, respectively, p = 0.008). After 24 hours, pain scores were similar \nbetween groups. Narcotic consumption was higher in the ropivacaine \ngroup on the day of surgery, but overall in-hospital narcotic usage was similar \nbetween groups. There were no differences in functional \nrecovery between groups at any time point. Patients in the epidural group \nwere more likely to have knee buckling (32.7% versus 6.7%, p = 0.002) and \ndelayed ambulation (16.3% versus 0.0%, p = 0.006) than patients in the \nropivacaine group. No infections occurred in \neither group, and the frequency of complications was not different between \ngroups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine was not more effective on analgesic efficacy than epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB in patients undergoing TKA.\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level I, therapeutic study.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pain management after TKA remains challenging and the efficacy of \ncontinuously infused intraarticular anesthetics remains a controversial topic.\nQUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We compared the side effect profile, analgesic efficacy, and \nfunctional recovery between patients receiving a continuous intraarticular \ninfusion of ropivacaine and patients receiving an epidural plus femoral nerve \nblock (FNB) after TKA.\nMETHODS: Ninety-four patients undergoing unilateral TKA were prospectively \nrandomized to receive a spinal-epidural analgesic infusion plus a \nsingle-injection FNB or a spinal anesthetic plus a continuous postoperative \nintraarticular infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine. All patients were blinded to their \ntreatment with placebo saline catheters. Blinded coinvestigators collected data \nconcerning side effect profiles (nausea, hypotension), analgesic efficacy (VAS \npain scores, narcotic usage), and functional recovery (timed up and go test, \nquadriceps strength, WOMAC scores, Knee Society scores, early postoperative \nambulatory ability, in-hospital falls). All complications and adverse events \nwere recorded.\nRESULTS: The frequency of nausea and hypertension was not different between the \nstudy groups. During the first 12 and 24 postoperative hours, the mean maximum \nVAS pain scores were higher in the ropivacaine group than in the epidural group \n(first 12 hours: 3.93 versus 1.14, respectively, p\u0412\u00a0<\u0412\u00a00.0001; 12-24 hours: 3.52 \nversus 1.93, respectively, p\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a00.008). After 24 hours, pain scores were similar \nbetween groups. Narcotic consumption was significantly higher in the ropivacaine \ngroup on the day of surgery, but overall in-hospital narcotic usage was similar \nbetween groups. There were no clinically important differences in functional \nrecovery between groups at any time point, but patients in the epidural group \nwere more likely to have knee buckling (32.7% versus 6.7%, p\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a00.002) and \ndelayed ambulation (16.3% versus 0.0%, p\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a00.006) than patients in the \nropivacaine group, though not in-hospital falls. No infections occurred in \neither group, and the frequency of complications was not different between \ngroups.\nCONCLUSIONS: A continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine can be \nrecommended as a safe, effective alternative to epidural analgesia plus \nsingle-injection FNB after TKA. Improved analgesic efficacy in the group that \nreceived epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB must be weighed against \nthe disadvantage of a higher likelihood of knee buckling and delayed ambulation \nwith that treatment approach.\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level I, therapeutic study.

Primary outcome measure was femoral component rotation. Secondary outcome measures were joint-line change, gap symmetry and function and quality-of-life outcomes. Gap balancing resulted in a significantly raised joint-line compared to measured resection. Gap symmetry was significantly better using gap balancing. Functional outcomes and quality-of-life were not significantly different at 24 months. Using computer navigation, gap balancing significantly raises the joint-line in order to improve gap symmetry.

A prospective blinded randomized controlled trial was completed with 103 patients randomized to measured resection (n = 52) or gap balancing (n = 51). Primary outcome measure was femoral component rotation. Secondary outcome measures were joint-line change, gap symmetry and function and quality-of-life outcomes. There was no significant difference in femoral component rotation between groups. Gap balancing resulted in a significantly raised joint-line compared to measured resection. Gap symmetry was significantly better using gap balancing. Functional outcomes and quality-of-life were not significantly different at 24 months. Gap balancing was not more effective than measured resection on femoral component rotation in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.",

We seek to \ndetermine whether a scalable, low-cost, unidirectional, text message-based \nmobile health intervention (TExT-MED) improves clinical outcomes, increases \nhealthy behaviors, and decreases ED utilization in a safety net population.\nMETHODS: We conducted an randomized controlled trial of 128 adult patients with \npoorly controlled diabetes (glycosylated hemoglobin [Hb A1C] level \u0432\u2030\u04908%) in an \nurban, public ED. The TExT-MED group received 2 daily text messages for 6 months \nin English or Spanish. The primary outcome was change in Hb A1C level. Secondary \noutcomes included changes in medication adherence, self-efficacy, performance of \nself-care tasks, quality of life, diabetes-specific knowledge, ED utilization, \nand patient satisfaction.\nRESULTS: Hb A1C level decreased by 1.05% in the TExT-MED group compared with \n0.60% in the controls (\u041e\u201d0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.27 to 1.17) at 6 \nmonths. Secondary outcomes favored the TExT-MED group, with the most sizable \nchange observed in self-reported medication adherence (as measured by the \nMorisky Medication Adherence Scale, an 8-point validated scale with higher \nscores representing better adherence), which improved from 4.5 to 5.4 in the \nTExT-MED group compared with a net decrease of -0.1 in the controls (\u041e\u201d1.1 [95% \nCI 0.1 to 2.1]). Effects were larger among Spanish speakers for both medication \nadherence (1.1 versus -0.3; \u041e\u201d1.4; 95% CI 0.2 to 2.7) and Hb A1C (-1.2% versus \n-0.4%) in the TExT-MED group. The proportion of patients who used emergency \nservices trended lower in the TExT-MED group (35.9% versus 51.6%; \u041e\u201d15.7%; 95% CI \n9.4% to 22%). Overall, 93.6% of respondents enjoyed TExT-MED and 100% would \nrecommend it to family/friends.\nCONCLUSION: The TExT-MED program did not result in a statistically significant \nimprovement in Hb A1C. However, trends toward improvement in the primary outcome \nof Hb A1C and other secondary outcomes, including quality of life, were \nobserved, the most pronounced being improved medication adherence. TExT-MED also \ndecreased ED utilization. These findings were magnified in the Spanish-speaking \nsubgroup. Technologies such as TExT-MED represent highly scalable, low-cost, and \nwidely accessible solutions for safety-net ED populations.",

Images were stored, \nand results were reported regarding contractility (good vs. poor), fluid status \n(empty inferior vena cava [hypovolemic] vs. full inferior vena cava [not \nhypovolemic]), and pericardial effusion (present vs. absent). The primary outcome \nwas mortality. Secondary outcomes included time from TB to operating room, \nintravenous fluid administration, blood product requirement, and intensive care \nunit admission.\nRESULTS: A total of 240 patients were randomized. Twenty-five patients were \nexcluded since they died upon arrival to the TB, leaving 215 patients in the \nstudy. Ninety-two patients were in the LTTEp group with 123 patients in the \nnon-LTTE group. The LTTEp and non-LTTE groups were similar in age (38 years vs. \n38.8 years, p = 0.75), Injury Severity Score (ISS) (19.2 vs. 19.0, p = 0.94), \nRevised Trauma Score (RTS) (5.5 vs. 6.0, p = 0.09), lactate (4.2 vs. 3.6, p = \n0.14), and mechanism of injury (p = 0.44). LTTEp had less intravenous fluid than \nnon-LTTE patients (1.5 L vs. 2.5 L, p < 0.0001), less time from TB to operating \nroom (35.6 minutes vs. 79.1 min, p = 0.0006), higher rate of intensive care unit \nadmission (80.4% vs. 67.2%, p = 0.04), and a mortality rate of 11% vs. 19.5% (p = \n0.09).\nCONCLUSION: LTTE was not more effective on mortality than standard care in \nhypotensive trauma patients during the early phase of resuscitation.",

Images were stored, \nand results were reported regarding contractility (good vs. poor), fluid status \n(empty inferior vena cava [hypovolemic] vs. full inferior vena cava [not \nhypovolemic]), and pericardial effusion (present vs. absent). Time from TB to \noperating room, intravenous fluid administration, blood product requirement, \nintensive care unit admission, and mortality were examined in both groups.\nRESULTS: A total of 240 patients were randomized. Twenty-five patients were \nexcluded since they died upon arrival to the TB, leaving 215 patients in the \nstudy. Ninety-two patients were in the LTTEp group with 123 patients in the \nnon-LTTE group. The LTTEp and non-LTTE groups were similar in age (38 years vs. \n38.8 years, p = 0.75), Injury Severity Score (ISS) (19.2 vs. 19.0, p = 0.94), \nRevised Trauma Score (RTS) (5.5 vs. 6.0, p = 0.09), lactate (4.2 vs. 3.6, p = \n0.14), and mechanism of injury (p = 0.44). Strikingly, LTTEp had significantly \nless intravenous fluid than non-LTTE patients (1.5 L vs. 2.5 L, p < 0.0001), \nless time from TB to operating room (35.6 minutes vs. 79.1 min, p = 0.0006), \nhigher rate of intensive care unit admission (80.4% vs. 67.2%, p = 0.04), and a \nlower mortality rate (11% vs. 19.5%, p = 0.09). Mortality differences were \nparticularly evident in the traumatic brain injury patients (14.7% in LTTEp vs. \n39.5% in non-LTTE, p = 0.03).\nCONCLUSION: LTTE is a useful guide for therapy in hypotensive trauma patients \nduring the early phase of resuscitation.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Posterior-cruciate-ligament-retaining (PCR) and \nposterior-cruciate-ligament-stabilized (PS) arthroplasties are two major common \npractices in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The hypothesis of the present study \nwas that compared with the PCR technique, the PS technique is associated with a \nhigher amount of postoperative blood loss and greater need for blood transfusion \nin cemented TKA.\nMETHODS: In this prospective, randomized study, 100 patients diagnosed with \nprimary knee osteoarthritis were randomly assigned to either the PCR group \n(Group I) or the PS group (Group II). The exclusion criteria were \nrheumatological joint disease, previous knee surgery, anticoagulant therapy and \nhypertension. There were no significant differences in age, body mass index and \ngender, between the groups. The haemoglobin and haematocrit levels of each \npatient were recorded preoperatively and on postoperative days 1, 3 and 5. The \npostoperative suction drainage and blood transfusion volumes were also recorded.\nRESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in haemoglobin or \nhaematocrit levels between the groups on postoperative days 1, 3 and 5. There \nwere also no statistically significant differences in the total measured blood \nloss volume, postoperative drainage amounts or transfusion rates between the \ngroups.\nCONCLUSION: Use of the PS technique during cemented TKA does not appear to \ninfluence the amount of perioperative blood loss or the need for postoperative \nblood transfusion in general. The clinical relevance of this study is that the \ndifference in blood loss between the PCR and PS techniques does not need to be \nconsidered by surgeons when performing TKA.",

The hypothesis of the present study \nwas that compared with the PCR technique, the PS technique is associated with a \nhigher amount of postoperative blood loss and greater need for blood transfusion \nin cemented TKA.\nMETHODS: In this prospective, randomized study, 100 patients diagnosed with \nprimary knee osteoarthritis were randomly assigned to either the PCR group \n(Group I) or the PS group (Group II). The exclusion criteria were \nrheumatological joint disease, previous knee surgery, anticoagulant therapy and \nhypertension. There were no significant differences in age, body mass index and \ngender, between the groups. The haemoglobin and haematocrit levels of each \npatient were recorded preoperatively and on postoperative days 1, 3 and 5. The \npostoperative suction drainage and blood transfusion volumes were also recorded.\nRESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in haemoglobin or \nhaematocrit levels between the groups on postoperative days 1, 3 and 5. There \nwere also no statistically significant differences in the total measured blood \nloss volume, postoperative drainage amounts or transfusion rates between the \ngroups.\nCONCLUSION: The PS technique was not more effective than the PCR technique in \nreducing postoperative blood loss or blood transfusion requirements in patients \nwith primary knee osteoarthritis undergoing cemented TKA.",

All the patients were treated with the same anaesthesia method, surgical team, surgical technique, prosthesis type, and rehabilitation process. American Knee Society Score values and knee flexion degrees were recorded. Isokinetic muscle strength measurements of both knees in flexion and extension were taken using 60\u0412\u00b0 and 180\u0412\u00b0/s angular velocity. The peak torque and total work values, isokinetic muscle strength differences, and total work difference values were calculated for surgically repaired and healthy knees.\nResults:\u0412\u00a0No significant difference in the mean American Knee Society Score values and knee flexion degrees was observed between the two groups. However, using isokinetic evaluation, a significant difference was found in the isokinetic muscle strength differences and total work difference of the flexor muscle between the two groups when patients were tested at 180\u0412\u00b0/s. Less loss of strength was detected in the isokinetic muscle strength differences of the flexor muscle in Group 2 (-4.2%) than in Group 1 (-23.1%).\nConclusion:\u0412\u00a0For patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty, post-operative flexor muscle strength is improved if the knee is flexed during wound closure.",

Although positive effects were found after physiotherapy, the recurrence and prolonged disability of a frozen shoulder are major factors to focus on to provide the appropriate treatment.\n\nQuestions/purposes: We wished to study the effectiveness of a shoulder countertraction apparatus on ROM, pain, and function in patients with a frozen shoulder and compare their results with those of control subjects who received conventional physiotherapy.\n\nMethods: A total of 100 participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group and a control group, with each group having 50 participants. The control group received physiotherapy and the experimental group received countertraction and physiotherapy. The total treatment time was 20 minutes a day for 5 days per week for 2 weeks. The outcome measures used were goniometer measurements, VAS, and the Oxford Shoulder Score.\n\nResults: Improvements were seen in the scores for shoulder flexion (94.1\u040e \u00b1 19.79\u040e at baseline increased to 161.9\u040e \u00b1 13.05\u040e after intervention), abduction ROM (90.4\u040e \u00b1 21.18\u040e at baseline increased to 154.8\u040e \u00b1 13.21\u040e after intervention), and pain (8.00 \u00b1 0.78 at baseline decreased to 3.48 \u00b1 0.71 after intervention) in the experimental group. Sixty percent of the participants (n = 30) were improved to the fourth stage of satisfactory joint function according to the Oxford Shoulder Score in the experimental group compared with 18% (n = 9) in the control group (p < 0.001).\n\nConclusions: Incorporating shoulder countertraction along with physiotherapy improves shoulder function compared with physiotherapy alone for the treatment of a frozen shoulder. Additional studies are needed focusing on this concept to increase the generalizability of the counter-traction apparatus in various groups.",

Sixty-two patients were randomized to receive topical application of Evicel (N = 31) or not (N = 31). The mean total blood loss was 1.9L(\u0412\u00b1 0.7) in the control group and 1.8L(\u0412\u00b1 0.5) in the treatment group (P = 0.4). The transfusion rate was 32.3% in the control group and 25.8% in the treatment group (P = 0.5). The transfusion rate decreased linearly with increasing preoperative Hb levels in the treatment group (P = 0.005). The results of this study suggest that topical application of this novel fibrin sealant doesn't reduce perioperative blood loss and the need for allogeneic blood transfusion.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: To compare the clinical outcome between the use of knotless sutures versus knot-tying sutures in arthroscopic Bankart repairs.\n\nMethods: Between January 2007 and January 2011, 87 patients who underwent arthroscopic Bankart repair with the use of knot-tying suture anchors or knotless suture anchors were evaluated, with 45 patients in the knot-tying suture group and 42 patients in the knotless group. Patients were assigned to either group, with odd-numbered patients going to the knot-tying suture arm and even-numbered patients assigned to the knotless arm. Outcomes included the Constant score, the visual analog scale (VAS) score, patient satisfaction score, and range of motion in forward flexion and external rotation with the arm in adduction. Redislocations or subluxations with the 2 techniques was also studied.\n\nResults: Both groups showed a statistically significant improvement between the preoperative and postoperative VAS scores and Constant scores. In the knot-tying suture group, the VAS score improved from 2.5 \u00b1 2.3 to 0.7 \u00b1 0.5 (P < .05) and the Constant score improved from 64 \u00b1 7 to 92 \u00b1 10 (P < .05). In the knotless group, the VAS score improved from 2.8 \u00b1 2.5 to 0.9 \u00b1 0.6 (P < .05), and the Constant score improved from 62 \u00b1 6 to 89 \u00b1 9 (P < .05). The patient satisfaction scores were 6.9 and 7.1 for the knot tying and knotless groups, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found when comparing the outcomes between the 2 groups. The change in the range of forward flexion and external rotation was also similar in the 2 groups. There was also no difference in recurrence or redislocation rates.\n\nConclusions: Both the knot-tying and knotless suture anchors groups showed statistically significant and similar improvement in VAS and Constant scores. Both anchors provided reasonable outcomes. The knotless suture anchor is a good alternative to knot-tying suture anchors so that arthroscopic Bankart repairs can be performed without knot tying.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: To compare the clinical outcome between the use of knotless sutures versus knot-tying sutures in arthroscopic Bankart repairs.\n\nMethods: Between January 2007 and January 2011, 87 patients who underwent arthroscopic Bankart repair with the use of knot-tying suture anchors or knotless suture anchors were evaluated, with 45 patients in the knot-tying suture group and 42 patients in the knotless group. Patients were assigned to either group, with odd-numbered patients going to the knot-tying suture arm and even-numbered patients assigned to the knotless arm. The primary outcome was the Constant score. Secondary outcomes included the visual analog scale (VAS) score, patient satisfaction score, range of motion in forward flexion and external rotation with the arm in adduction, and redislocations or subluxations.\n\nResults: No statistically significant differences were found when comparing the Constant scores between the 2 groups. The knot-tying suture group had a postoperative Constant score of 92 \u00b1 10 and the knotless group had a postoperative Constant score of 89 \u00b1 9. For secondary outcomes, the postoperative VAS scores were 0.7 \u00b1 0.5 and 0.9 \u00b1 0.6 for the knot-tying and knotless groups, respectively. The patient satisfaction scores were 6.9 and 7.1 for the knot tying and knotless groups, respectively. The change in the range of forward flexion and external rotation was similar in the 2 groups. There was no difference in recurrence or redislocation rates between groups.\n\nConclusions: Knotless suture anchors were not more effective than knot-tying suture anchors on the Constant score in patients undergoing arthroscopic Bankart repairs.",

However, recent basic science and clinical data have suggested recurrent instability may be reduced with immobilization in external rotation after primary shoulder dislocation.\n\nQuestions/purposes: We performed a randomized controlled trial to compare the (1) frequency of recurrent instability and (2) disease-specific quality-of-life scores after treatment of first-time shoulder dislocation using either immobilization in external rotation or immobilization in internal rotation in a group of young patients.\n\nMethods: Sixty patients younger than 35 years of age with primary, traumatic, anterior shoulder dislocations were randomized (concealed, computer-generated) to immobilization with either an internal rotation sling (n = 29) or an external rotation brace (n = 31) at a mean of 4 days after closed reduction (range, 1-7 days). Patients with large bony lesions or polytrauma were excluded. The two groups were similar at baseline. Both groups were immobilized for 4 weeks with identical therapy protocols thereafter. Blinded assessments were completed by independent observers for a minimum of 12 months (mean, 25 months; range, 12-43 months). The primary outcome was recurrent instability, defined as a second documented anterior dislocation or multiple episodes of shoulder subluxation severe enough for the patient to request surgical stabilization. Secondary outcomes included validated disease-specific quality-of-life data (Western Ontario Shoulder Instability index [WOSI], American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons evaluation [ASES]). Ten patients (17%, five from each group) were lost to followup. Reported compliance with immobilization in both groups was excellent (80%).\n\nResults: There was no difference in the rate of recurrent instability between groups: 10 of 27 patients (37%) with the external rotation brace versus 10 of 25 patients (40%) with the sling redislocated or developed symptomatic recurrent instability (p = 0.41). WOSI scores were not different between groups (p = 0.74). ASES scores were not significantly different between groups (p = 0.05).\n\nConclusions: Immobilization in external rotation was not more effective than sling immobilization in the prevention of recurrent instability after primary anterior shoulder dislocation in patients younger than 35 years of age.",

In this study, 2 \ndifferent treatment groups were compared for pain control during shoulder \ndislocation reduction.\nMETHODS: The study was planned to be prospective and randomized. The primary outcome was reduction success. As procedural \nsedation analgesia (SA), titration of ketamine 1 to 2 mg/kg was administered \nintravenously to group 1. Suprascapular nerve block (SNB) was applied under \nultrasound guidance (USG) to group 2. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay, complications, side \neffects, patient-physician satisfaction, and ease of application. Conformity to normal distribution of \nvariables was examined with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The \u041f\u20212 test and Fisher \ntest were used to evaluate differences between the groups in categorical \nvariables and the Mann-Whitney U test, and a value of P<.05 was accepted as \nstatistically significant.\nRESULTS: The study comprised a total of 41 patients; 20 in the group 1 and 21 in \nthe group 2. No statistically significant difference was determined between the \ngroups in terms of age (P=.916), sex (P=.972), reduction success (P=.540), and \npatient-physician satisfaction (P=.198). The time spent in the emergency \ndepartment (ED) by patients in the SA group was longer compared \nwith the SNB group. No side effects were observed in the SNB group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Suprascapular nerve block was not more effective on reduction success than sedation analgesia in patients with shoulder dislocations.",

The primary \noutcome was the Simple Shoulder Test (SST). Secondary outcomes included American \nShoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, Constant score, University of \nCalifornia-Los Angeles (UCLA) score, and Short Form-12 (SF-12) health assessment \nalong with physical examination including range of motion and dynamometer \nstrength testing. Intraoperative data including tear size, repair configuration, \nand concomitant procedures were recorded. Follow-up examination was performed at \nregular intervals up to 2 years. Preoperative imaging was reviewed to classify \nthe acromial morphologic type, acromial angle, and lateral acromial angulation.\nRESULTS: A total of 114 patients were initially enrolled in the study, and 95 \n(83%; 43 nonacromioplasty, 52 acromioplasty) were available for a minimum 2-year \nfollow-up. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics, \nincluding number of tendons torn, repair configuration, concomitant procedures, \nand acromion type and angles. There were no significant differences in functional \noutcomes between nonacromioplasty and acromioplasty groups at any time point.\nCONCLUSION: Acromioplasty was not more effective than nonacromioplasty in \npatients undergoing arthroscopic repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears.",

Desirable methods of relieving the patient's pain are worth exploring. Oral supplement of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a potential option. In the present study, we investigated whether short-term administration of ATP benefits patients undergoing TKA. A total of 244 subjects were randomized to receive 120mg ATP or placebo each day for 4weeks. No significant differences in the primary outcome were detected between groups. Differences in quadriceps strength, pain scores at postoperative days 7, 14, 21, and 28 and total opioid consumption were detected.

Desirable methods of relieving the patient's pain are worth exploring. Oral supplement of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a potential option. In the present study, we decide to investigate whether short-term administration of ATP benefits patients undergoing TKA. A total of 244 subjects were randomized to receive 120mg ATP or placebo each day for 4weeks. Significant differences in quadriceps strength, pain scores at postoperative days 7, 14, 21, and 28 and total opioid consumption were detected. It follows that oral supplement of ATP could benefit patients recovering from TKA.",

Eligible patients with \nED nausea and vomiting were randomized to receive 4 mg intravenous ondansetron, \n20 mg intravenous metoclopramide, or saline solution placebo. Primary outcome \nwas mean change in visual analog scale (VAS) rating of nausea severity from \nenrollment to 30 minutes after study drug administration. Secondary outcomes \nincluded patient satisfaction, need for rescue antiemetic treatment, and adverse \nevents.\nRESULTS: Of 270 recruited patients, 258 (95.6%) were available for analysis. Of \nthese patients, 87 (33.7%) received ondansetron; 88 (34.1%), metoclopramide; and \n83 (32.2%), placebo. Baseline characteristics between treatment groups and \nrecruitment site were similar. Mean decrease in VAS score was 27 mm (95% \nconfidence interval [CI] 22 to 33 mm) for ondansetron, 28 mm (95% CI 22 to 34 \nmm) for metoclopramide, and 23 mm (95% CI 16 to 30 mm) for placebo. Satisfaction \nwith treatment was reported by 54.1% (95% CI 43.5% to 64.5%), 61.6% (95% CI \n51.0% to 71.4%), and 59.5% (95% CI 48.4% to 69.9%) for ondansetron, \nmetoclopramide, and placebo, respectively; rescue medication was required by \n34.5% (95% CI 25.0% to 45.1%), 17.9% (95% CI 10.8% to 27.2%), and 36.3% (95% CI \n26.3% to 47.2%), respectively. Nine minor adverse events were reported.\nCONCLUSION: Reductions in nausea severity for this adult ED nausea and vomiting \npopulation were similar for 4 mg intravenous ondansetron, 20 mg intravenous \nmetoclopramide, and placebo. There was a trend toward greater reductions in VAS \nratings and a lesser requirement for rescue medication in the antiemetic drug \ngroups, but differences from the placebo group did not reach significance. The \nmajority of patients in all groups were satisfied with treatment.",

        "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: We compare efficacy of ondansetron and metoclopramide with \nplacebo for adults with undifferentiated emergency department (ED) nausea and \nvomiting.\nMETHODS: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was \nconducted in 2 metropolitan EDs in Melbourne, Australia. Eligible patients with \nED nausea and vomiting were randomized to receive 4 mg intravenous ondansetron, \n20 mg intravenous metoclopramide, or saline solution placebo. Primary outcome \nwas mean change in visual analog scale (VAS) rating of nausea severity from \nenrollment to 30 minutes after study drug administration. Secondary outcomes \nincluded patient satisfaction, need for rescue antiemetic treatment, and adverse \nevents.\nRESULTS: Of 270 recruited patients, 258 (95.6%) were available for analysis. Of \nthese patients, 87 (33.7%) received ondansetron; 88 (34.1%), metoclopramide; and \n83 (32.2%), placebo. Baseline characteristics between treatment groups and \nrecruitment site were similar. Mean decrease in VAS score was 27 mm (95% \nconfidence interval [CI] 22 to 33 mm) for ondansetron, 28 mm (95% CI 22 to 34 \nmm) for metoclopramide, and 23 mm (95% CI 16 to 30 mm) for placebo. Satisfaction \nwith treatment was reported by 54.1% (95% CI 43.5% to 64.5%), 61.6% (95% CI \n51.0% to 71.4%), and 59.5% (95% CI 48.4% to 69.9%) for ondansetron, \nmetoclopramide, and placebo, respectively; rescue medication was required by \n34.5% (95% CI 25.0% to 45.1%), 17.9% (95% CI 10.8% to 27.2%), and 36.3% (95% CI \n26.3% to 47.2%), respectively. Nine minor adverse events were reported.\nCONCLUSION: Ondansetron and metoclopramide were not more effective than placebo \non nausea severity in patients with undifferentiated emergency department nausea \nand vomiting.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of different loads of knee extensor open \nkinetic chain resistance training on anterior knee laxity and function in the \nACL-injured (ACLI) knee.\nMETHODS: Fifty-eight ACLI subjects were randomised to one of three (12-week \nduration) training groups. The STAND group trained according to a standardised \nrehabilitation protocol. Subjects in the LOW and HIGH group trained as did the \nSTAND group but with the addition of seated knee extensor open kinetic chain \nresistance training at loads of 2 sets of 20 repetition maximum (RM) and 20 sets \nof 2RM, respectively. Anterior knee laxity and measurements of physical and \nsubjective function were performed at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks. Thirty-six \nsubjects were tested at both baseline and 12 weeks (STAND n = 13, LOW n = 11, \nHIGH n = 12).\nRESULTS: The LOW group demonstrated a reduction in 133 N anterior knee laxity \nbetween baseline and 12 weeks testing when compared to the HIGH and the STAND \ngroups (p = 0.009). Specifically, the trained-untrained knee laxity decreased an \naverage of approximately 5 mm in the LOW group while remaining the same in the \nother two groups.\nCONCLUSION: Twelve weeks of knee extensor open kinetic chain resistance training \nat loads of 2 sets of 20RM led to a reduction in anterior knee laxity in the \nACLI knee. This reduction in laxity does not appear to offer any significant \nshort-term functional advantages when compared to a standard rehabilitation \nprotocol. These results indicate that knee laxity can be decreased with \nresistance training of the thigh muscles.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency technology for shoulder instability was rapidly \nadopted despite limited clinical evidence and a poor understanding of its \nindications. Reports of serious adverse events followed, leading to its \nabandonment. This paper presents findings from a multicenter randomized clinical \ntrial evaluating the safety and efficacy of electrothermal arthroscopic \ncapsulorrhaphy (ETAC) compared with open inferior capsular shift (ICS).\nMETHODS: Patients (>14 years) diagnosed with multidirectional instability or \nmultidirectional laxity with anteroinferior instability and failed nonoperative \ntreatment were enrolled. Patients with bone lesions or labral, biceps anchor, or \nfull-thickness rotator cuff tears were excluded intraoperatively. The primary \noutcome was the Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index at 2 years \npostoperatively. Secondary outcomes included American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons \nscore, Constant score, active range of motion, recurrent instability, and \nsurgical times.\nRESULTS: Fifty-four subjects (mean age, 23 years; 37 women) were randomized to \nETAC (n = 28) or open ICS (n = 26). The groups were comparable at baseline, \nexcept for external rotation at the side. At 2 years postoperatively, there were \nno statistically significant differences between groups for the Western Ontario \nShoulder Instability Index (P = .71), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score \n(P = .43), Constant score (P = .43), and active range of motion. Recurrent \ninstability was not statistically different (ETAC, 2; open, 4; P = .41). ETAC \n(23 minutes) was significantly shorter than open ICS (59 minutes) (P < .01) \nsurgery. Three subjects (1 ETAC, 2 open) had stiff shoulders.\nCONCLUSIONS: ETAC was not more effective on the Western Ontario Shoulder \nInstability Index than open ICS in patients with multidirectional shoulder \ninstability.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency technology for shoulder instability was rapidly \nadopted despite limited clinical evidence and a poor understanding of its \nindications. Reports of serious adverse events followed, leading to its \nabandonment. This paper presents findings from a multicenter randomized clinical \ntrial evaluating the safety and efficacy of electrothermal arthroscopic \ncapsulorrhaphy (ETAC) compared with open inferior capsular shift (ICS) and \nreviews the role of randomized trials in adopting new technology.\nMETHODS: Patients (>14\u0412\u00a0years) diagnosed with multidirectional instability or \nmultidirectional laxity with anteroinferior instability and failed nonoperative \ntreatment were enrolled. Patients with bone lesions or labral, biceps anchor, or \nfull-thickness rotator cuff tears were excluded intraoperatively. Outcomes \nincluded Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index, function and recurrent \ninstability at 2 years postoperatively, and surgical times.\nRESULTS: Fifty-four subjects (mean age, 23\u0412\u00a0years; 37 women) were randomized to \nETAC (n\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a028) or open ICS (n\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a026). The groups were comparable at baseline, \nexcept for external rotation at the side. At 2 years postoperatively, there were \nno statistically or clinically significant differences between groups for the \nWestern Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (P\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a0.71), American Shoulder and \nElbow Surgeons score (P\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a0.43), Constant score (P\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a0.43), and active range of \nmotion. Recurrent instability was not statistically different (ETAC,\u0412\u00a02; open,\u0412\u00a04; \nP\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a0.41). ETAC (23\u0412\u00a0minutes) was significantly shorter than open ICS (59\u0412\u00a0minutes) \n(P\u0412\u00a0<\u0412\u00a0.01) surgery. Three subjects (1 ETAC, 2 open) had stiff shoulders.\nCONCLUSIONS: At 2 years postoperatively, quality of life and functional outcomes \nbetween groups were not clinically different. ETAC had fewer complications and \nepisodes of recurrence compared with open surgery. This evidence reinforces the \nneed to critically evaluate new technology before widespread clinical use.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: It has been known for years that deep vein thrombi (DVT) start to \ndevelop during total joint arthroplasty. Previously, we reported effective \nprevention of venous stasis by transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation \n(TENS). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of TENS in patients during total knee arthroplasty (TKA).\nMETHODS: Ninety patients undergoing primary TKA were involved and randomly \nallocated to the TENS or control group. In the TENS group, electrical \nstimulation of the common fibular nerve, which produced a brisk dorsiflexion of \nthe ankle, was performed for the operated leg during surgery. In the control \ngroup, no electrical stimulation was applied. The primary outcome was the incidence of DVT assessed by ultrasonography on post-operative day (POD) 1. Secondary outcomes included serum D-dimer and soluble fibrin monomer complex (SFMC) levels measured before surgery, immediately after surgery, and POD 1.\nRESULTS: The incidence of DVT was 11% (5/45 cases) in the TENS group and 31% (14/45 cases) in the control group (p = 0.02). Immediately after surgery, D-dimer and SFMC levels were lower in the TENS group compared with control (p < 0.05). There were no adverse effects related to TENS.\nCONCLUSIONS: TENS was more effective than no intervention in preventing DVT in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: It has been known for years that deep vein thrombi (DVT) start to \ndevelop during total joint arthroplasty. Previously, we reported effective \nprevention of venous stasis by transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation \n(TENS). It is hypothesized that TENS might be a thromboprophylactic tool for the \nlimb undergoing surgery. The purpose of this study is to clarify the clinical \nefficacy and safety of TENS in patients during total knee arthroplasty (TKA).\nMETHODS: Ninety patients undergoing primary TKA were involved and randomly \nallocated to the TENS or control group. In the TENS group, electrical \nstimulation of the common fibular nerve, which produced a brisk dorsiflexion of \nthe ankle, was performed for the operated leg during surgery. In the control \ngroup, no electrical stimulation was applied. Serum D-dimer and soluble fibrin \nmonomer complex (SFMC) levels were measured before surgery, immediately after \nsurgery, and post-operative day (POD) 1. Ultrasonography was performed on POD 1.\nRESULTS: Immediately after surgery, D-dimer and SFMC levels of each group were \nsignificantly lower in the TENS group compared with control (p < 0.05). The \nincidence of DVT was 11 % (five cases) in the TENS group while 31 % (14 cases) \nin control (p = 0.02). There were no adverse effects related to TENS.\nCONCLUSIONS: TENS during TKA showed significant effects on preventing DVT. \nSustaining muscle pump activation during surgery prevented not only venous \nstasis, but also hypercoagulability of blood. Intraoperative TENS is a safe and \nnovel strategy against early post-operative thromboembolism, which is difficult \nto be completed through existing prophylaxis after total joint arthroplasty.",

All patients received the same cementless prosthetic \ncomponents through an anterolateral MIS approach while they were in a lateral \ndecubitus position. Leg length, global or total offset (representing the \ncombination of femoral and acetabular offset), and femoral offset differences \nwere restored using either navigation or fluoroscopy. Postoperatively, residual \nleg length and global and femoral offset discrepancies were analyzed on \nmagnification-corrected radiographs of the pelvis by an independent and blinded \nexaminer using digital planning software. Accuracy was defined as the relative \npostoperative difference between the surgically treated and the unaffected \ncontralateral side for leg length and offset, respectively; precision was \ndefined as the absolute postoperative deviation of leg length and global and \nfemoral offset regardless of lengthening or shortening of leg length and offset \nthroughout the THA.

For secondary outcomes, global offset showed \na mean difference of 0.2 mm (95% CI, -0.9 to +1.3 mm; p = 0.740) and femoral \noffset showed a mean difference of 1.7 mm (95% CI, +0.4 to +2.9 mm; p = 0.008). \nFor the absolute precision of leg length and global and femoral offset \nequalization, there was a mean difference of 1.7 \u00b1 0.3 mm (p < 0.001) between \nfluoroscopy and navigation. The biomechanical reconstruction with a residual leg \nlength and global and femoral offset discrepancy less than 5 mm and less than 8 \nmm, respectively, succeeded in 93% and 98%, respectively, in the navigation \ngroup and in 54% and 95%, respectively, in the fluoroscopy group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Imageless navigation was not more effective than intraoperative \nfluoroscopy for leg length restoration in patients undergoing MIS THA with the \npatient in the lateral decubitus position.",

Nebulized\u0412\u00a0fentanyl\u0412\u00a0is also an effective temporary substitute. This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of nebulized fentanyl with intravenous (IV) morphine on management of acute limb pain.\nMethods\nThis was a placebo-controlled, double-blind\u0412\u00a0randomized clinical trial. Ninety emergency department patients with moderate to severe pain aged 15 to 50 years were blocked randomized and enrolled in this study. Forty-seven patients in the experimental group received nebulized fentanyl (4\u0412\u00a0\u041e\u0458g/kg) and IV normal saline as placebo, and the remaining 43 patients in the control group received IV morphine (0.1 mg/kg) and nebulized normal saline as placebo. All participants' pain scores were assessed by Numerical Rating Scale before and after intervention at 5-, 10-, 15-, 30-, 45-, and 60-minute intervals. Patients' vital sign and possible\u0412\u00a0adverse effects\u0412\u00a0were recorded respectively. Finally, all participants were assessed for their satisfaction.\nResults\nThe mean initial pain score in the experimental group was 8.7 and 8.4 in the control group (P\u0412\u00a0= .1). Pain relief in both groups after 5 and 10 minutes were similar (P\u0412\u00a0= .72). Although the pain relief was significantly greater with fentanyl at 15 minutes, this difference is not clinically significant. Pain management in both groups was successful and was more than 3 scores reduction in Numerical Rating Scale. Patient satisfaction in both groups was similar. No adverse effects were reported in the experimental group.\nConclusion\nThis study suggests that nebulized fentanyl is a rapid, safe, and effective method for temporary control of acute limb pain in emergency department patients.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Ankle sprain is a frequently encountered traumatic injury in \nemergency departments and is associated with important health expenses. However, \nthe appropriate care of this traumatic injury remains a matter of debate. We \ntested the hypothesis that compression stockings speed up recovery from ankle \nsprain.\nMETHODS: Recent (<48 hours) cases of ankle sprain without other traumatic injury \nin patients aged between 18 and 55 years were included. Patients were randomly \nallocated to placebo Jersey or class II compression stockings (Venoflex; \nThuasne, Levallois-Perret, France). The primary end point was the time to \nrecovery of normal painless walking without requirement for analgesic drug. \nSecondary end points were time to return to sport activity, pain, analgesic \nconsumption, and ankle edema (bimalleolar and midfoot circumferences).\nRESULTS: We randomized 126 patients and analyzed 117 patients (60 in the placebo \ngroup and 57 in the compression group). The median time to normal painless \nwalking was not significantly decreased (P = .16). No significant differences \nwere observed in pain, analgesic consumption, and bimalleloar and midfoot \ncircumferences. No safety issue was reported. In the subgroup of patients with \nregular sport activity, the time to return to sport activity was shorter in \npatients treated with compression stockings (P = .02).\nCONCLUSIONS: Compression stockings failed to significantly modify the time to \nreturn to normal painless walking in ankle sprain. A beneficial effect was \nobserved only in a subgroup of patients, as compression stockings significantly \ndecreased the time to return to sport activity.",

However, \nthe appropriate care of this traumatic injury remains a matter of debate. We \ntested the hypothesis that compression stockings speed up recovery from ankle \nsprain.\nMETHODS: Recent (<48 hours) cases of ankle sprain without other traumatic injury \nin patients aged between 18 and 55 years were included. Patients were randomly \nallocated to placebo Jersey or class II compression stockings (Venoflex; \nThuasne, Levallois-Perret, France). The primary end point was the time to \nrecovery of normal painless walking without requirement for analgesic drug. \nSecondary end points were time to return to sport activity, pain, analgesic \nconsumption, and ankle edema (bimalleolar and midfoot circumferences).\nRESULTS: We randomized 126 patients and analyzed 117 patients (60 in the placebo \ngroup and 57 in the compression group). The median time to normal painless \nwalking was not significantly decreased (P = .16). No significant differences \nwere observed in pain, analgesic consumption, and bimalleolar and midfoot \ncircumferences. No safety issue was reported.\nCONCLUSIONS: Compression stockings were not more effective than placebo in \nreducing time to recovery of normal painless walking in patients with ankle \nsprain.",

        "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: We compare the safety and efficacy of ecallantide with placebo \nin subjects undergoing assessment for acute angiotensin-converting enzyme \ninhibitor-induced angioedema (ACEIA) in an emergency department (ED).\nMETHODS: This was a multicenter, phase 2, double-blind study with subjects \nrandomized to receive a single subcutaneous dose of ecallantide (10, 30, or 60 \nmg) or placebo plus physician-directed conventional therapy. The primary \nendpoint was defined as meeting predetermined discharge eligibility criteria \nwithin 6 hours of study drug administration. Discharge criteria included \nimprovement of edema, stable vital signs, absence of stridor, absence of dyspnea \nor use of accessory muscles during respiration, absence of drooling, and ability \nto drink without difficulty.\nRESULTS: An interim analysis showed that a high percentage of subjects met the \nprimary endpoint, and the study was halted. Overall, 79 subjects were randomized \nand 76 had data for analysis. Most had mild (45%) or moderate (42%) ACEIA. The \ndischarge eligibility endpoint was met by 72% of the placebo group and 85%, 89%, \nand 89% of the ecallantide 10-, 30-, and 60-mg groups, respectively. This \ndifference in meeting discharge eligibility endpoint criteria between treatment \ngroups was not statistically significant. The incidence of treatment-emergent \nadverse events was similar between placebo and active-treatment groups.\nCONCLUSION: The addition of ecallantide to standard therapy does not appear to \nimprove angioedema compared with placebo in ED patients with ACEIA. Our data \nsuggest that most ED patients presenting with mild to moderate ACEIA are likely \nto meet our discharge eligibility criteria within 6 hours of treatment, \nregardless of intervention. Further studies to assess the utility of ecallantide \nin patients with more severe angioedema may be useful. No new safety signals \nrelated to ecallantide administration were identified.",

Discharge criteria included \nimprovement of edema, stable vital signs, absence of stridor, absence of dyspnea \nor use of accessory muscles during respiration, absence of drooling, and ability \nto drink without difficulty.\nRESULTS: An interim analysis showed that a high percentage of subjects met the \nprimary endpoint, and the study was halted. Overall, 79 subjects were randomized \nand 76 had data for analysis. Most had mild (45%) or moderate (42%) ACEIA. The \ndischarge eligibility endpoint was met by 72% of the placebo group and 85%, 89%, \nand 89% of the ecallantide 10-, 30-, and 60-mg groups, respectively. This \ndifference in meeting discharge eligibility endpoint criteria between treatment \ngroups was not statistically significant. The incidence of treatment-emergent \nadverse events was similar between placebo and active-treatment groups.\nCONCLUSION: Ecallantide was not more effective than placebo in patients with \nacute angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema in the \nemergency department.",

The US \nneedling group underwent US-guided needling and received a subacromial \ncorticosteroid injection. The ESWT group received ESWT 3 times a week. All \npatients were prospectively evaluated; American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, \nSimple Shoulder Test, and visual analog scale for pain scores were recorded \nbefore the procedure and at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, and the last \nfollow-up. The size and morphology of the deposits were evaluated by \nradiography.\nRESULTS: The average follow-up period was 23.0 months. At last follow-up, the \nmean size of the deposits decreased to 0.5 mm from 14.8 mm in the US needling \ngroup and to 5.6 mm from 11.0 mm in the ESWT group (P = .001). At 1-year \nfollow-up, the US needling group had American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons \nassessment scores of 90.3 compared to 74.6 in the ESWT group (P = .001), Simple \nShoulder Test scores of 83.3 compared to 70.8 (P = .015), and visual analog \nscale for pain scores of 1.4 compared to 3.3 (P = .003). The initial calcium \ndeposit sizes and clinical outcomes were weakly correlated in both groups (P > \n.05).\nCONCLUSION: US-guided needling treatment was more effective than ESWT in patients \nwith calcific tendinitis of the shoulder.",

(DePuy Int, Warsaw, IN, USA) \nhumeral head resurfacing implants (HHRIs).\nMETHODS: The study randomly allocated 32 patients (13 women), mean age 63 years \n(range, 39-82 years), with shoulder osteoarthritis to a Copeland (n = 14) or \nGlobal C.A.P. (n = 18) HHRI. Patients were monitored for 2 years with \nradiostereometry, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, Constant Shoulder Score \n(CSS), and the Western Ontario Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder Index (WOOS). LGHO \nwas measured preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively.\nRESULTS: At 2 years, total translation (TT) was 0.48 mm (standard deviation \n[SD], 0.21 mm) for the Copeland and 0.82 mm (SD, 0.46 mm) for the Global C.A.P. \n(P = .06). Five HHRI were revised, and in the interval before the last follow-up \n(revision or 2 years), TT of 0.58 mm (SD, 0.61 mm) for revised HHRI was higher \n(P = .02) than TT of 0.22 mm (SD, 0.17 mm) in nonrevised HHRI. A comparison of \nTT at the last follow-up (revision or 2 years) found no difference between the \nHHRIs (P = .12). Periprosthetic BMD decreased initially but increased \ncontinuously after 6 months for both HHRIs. At 2 years, BMD was 48% higher \naround the Copeland HHRI (P = .005). The mean difference in LGHO was \nsignificantly higher for the Copeland than for the Global C.A.P. HHRI (P = .02). \nClinical results evaluated with CSS and WOOS improved over time for both implant \ngroups (P < .01), with no differences between the groups.\nCONCLUSION: Both implants had only little migration and good clinical results. \nPeriprosthetic BMD and LGHO both increased for the Copeland HHRI more than for \nthe Global C.A.P HHRI.",

In this study, the analgesic effects \nof six different drug combinations were compared.\nMETHODS: A total of 256 patients undergoing TKA for primary osteoarthritis were \nrandomized into one of six groups: a control group (saline solution, \nepinephrine, and cefazolin, n = 42), Group 1 (ropivacaine, n = 43), Group 2 \n(ropivacaine + morphine, n = 43), Group 3 (ropivacaine + ketorolac, n = 42), \nGroup 4 (ropivacaine + morphine + ketorolac, n = 43), and Group 5 (ropivacaine + \nmorphine + ketorolac + methylprednisolone, n = 43). Pain level assessed by \nvisual analogue scale (VAS) and opioid consumption were primary outcomes. The \nincidence of complications, range of motion (ROM), C-reactive protein (CRP) \nvalue, and the amount of post-operative blood drainage were also compared.\nRESULTS: Patients in Groups 4 and 5 complained less pain than the control group \nfor the first 12 h after surgery, and the patients in the other groups showed \nless pain only during the initial 6 h after surgery. Groups 4 and 5 also showed \nless opioid consumption than the control group during the 24 h period after \nsurgery. Patients in Group 5 showed no significant difference in VAS score and \nopioid consumption compared with Group 4, but they had lower CRP value and \ngreater ROM than any other groups at post-operative day 2 and day 4.\nCONCLUSION: Group 4 (ropivacaine + morphine + ketorolac) was not more effective \non pain level and opioid consumption than Group 5 (ropivacaine + morphine + \nketorolac + methylprednisolone) in patients undergoing TKA for primary \nosteoarthritis.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Although the analgesic effect of periarticular injection after total \nknee arthroplasty (TKA) has been well documented, the gold standard for drug \ncombination has not yet been established. In this study, the analgesic effects \nof six different drug combinations were compared.\nMETHODS: A total of 256 patients undergoing TKA for primary osteoarthritis were \nrandomized into one of six groups: a control group (saline solution, \nepinephrine, and cefazolin, n = 42), Group 1 (ropivacaine, n = 43), Group 2 \n(ropivacaine + morphine, n = 43), Group 3 (ropivacaine + ketorolac, n = 42), \nGroup 4 (ropivacaine + morphine + ketorolac, n = 43), and Group 5 (ropivacaine + \nmorphine + ketorolac + methylprednisolone, n = 43). Pain level assessed by \nvisual analogue scale (VAS) and opioid consumption were primary outcomes. The \nincidence of complications, range of motion (ROM), C-reactive protein (CRP) \nvalue, and the amount of post-operative blood drainage were also compared.\nRESULTS: Patients in Groups 4 and 5 complained less pain than the control group \nfor the first 12 h after surgery, and the patients in the other groups showed \nless pain only during the initial 6 h after surgery. Groups 4 and 5 also showed \nless opioid consumption than the control group during the 24 h period after \nsurgery. Patients in Group 5 showed no significant difference in VAS score and \nopioid consumption compared with Group 4, but they had lower CRP value and \ngreater ROM than any other groups at post-operative day 2 and day 4.\nCONCLUSION: The combination of ropivacaine, morphine, and ketorolac showed a \nsignificantly stronger and sufficiently synergistic analgesic effect without \nadding methylprednisolone in periarticular injection after TKA. The clinical \nrelevance of the study is that the combination of ropivacaine, morphine, and \nketorolac can be a good option for periarticular injection following TKA in \nterms of synergistic analgesic effect and efficiency of drug combination.",

We \nexamined the ability of 1 dose of benralizumab, an investigational \nantiinterleukin 5 receptor \u041e\u00b1 monoclonal antibody, to reduce recurrence after \nacute asthma exacerbations.\nMETHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, eligible \nsubjects presented to the ED with an asthma exacerbation, had partial response \nto treatment, and greater than or equal to 1 additional exacerbation within the \nprevious year. Subjects received 1 intravenous infusion of placebo (n = 38) or \nbenralizumab (0.3 mg/kg, n = 36 or 1.0 mg/kg, n = 36) added to outpatient \nmanagement. The primary outcome was the proportion of subjects with greater than \nor equal to 1 exacerbation at 12 weeks in placebo vs the combined benralizumab \ngroups. Other outcomes included the time-weighted rate of exacerbations at week \n12, adverse events, blood eosinophil counts, asthma symptom changes, and health \ncare resource utilization.\nRESULTS: The proportion of subjects with greater than or equal to 1 asthma \nexacerbation at 12 weeks was not different between placebo and the combined \nbenralizumab groups (38.9% vs 33.3%; P = .67). However, compared with placebo, \nbenralizumab reduced asthma exacerbation rates by 49% (3.59 vs 1.82; P = .01) \nand exacerbations resulting in hospitalization by 60% (1.62 vs 0.65; P = .02) in \nthe combined groups. Benralizumab reduced blood eosinophil counts but did not \naffect other outcomes, while demonstrating an acceptable safety profile.\nCONCLUSIONS: When added to usual care, 1 dose of benralizumab reduced the rate \nand severity of exacerbations experienced over 12 weeks by subjects who \npresented to the ED with acute asthma.",

We aimed to prospectively assess the \nutility of the Lab-score in safely decreasing antibiotic prescriptions in \nchildren with FWS and to determine its diagnostic characteristics compared to \ncommon SBI biomarkers.\nMETHODS: Randomized controlled trial in children 7 days to 36 months old with \nFWS, allocated either to the Lab-score group (Lab-score reported, blinded WBC \ncount) or to the control group (WBC, bands and C-reactive protein determined, \nblinded procalcitonin and Lab-score), followed up until recovery. The primary \noutcome was antibiotic prescription rate. Secondary outcomes included admission \nrate and diagnostic properties of the Lab-score.\nRESULTS: 271 children were analyzed. No statistically significant difference \nconcerning antibiotic prescription rate was observed: 41.2% (54 of 131) in the \nLab-score group and 42.1% (59 of 140) in the control group (p = 1.000). A \nLab-score \u22653 showed the following characteristics: sensitivity 85.1% (95% CI: \n76.5-93.6%), specificity 87.3% (95% CI: 82.7-91.8%), positive predictive value \n68.7% (95% CI: 58.7-78.7%), negative predictive value 94.1% (95% CI: 91.5-97.9%), \npositive and negative likelihood ratios: 6.68 and 0.17 respectively. Area under \nthe receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.911 (95% CI: 0.871-0.950) for \nthe Lab-score.\nDISCUSSION: The Lab-score was not more effective than standard care in decreasing \nantibiotic prescription rates in children with fever without source.",

This study was completed in 2 large academic \nEDs. Bupivacaine or normal saline solution was delivered intranasally (0.3 mL \nper side) with the Tx360 device. Pain and nausea were measured at 0, 5, and 15 \nminutes by a 100-mm visual analog scale. The primary endpoint was a 50% \nreduction in pain at 15 minutes. Telephone follow-up assessed 24-hour pain and \nnausea through a 0- to 10-point verbal scale and adverse effects.\nRESULTS: The median reported baseline pain in the bupivacaine group was 80 mm \n(IQR 66 mm - 93 mm) and 78.5 mm (IQR 64 mm to 91.75 mm) in the normal saline \nsolution group. A 50% reduction in pain was achieved in 48.8% of the bupivacaine \ngroup (20/41 patients) versus 41.3% in the normal saline solution group (19/46 \npatients), for an absolute risk difference of 7.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] \n-13% to 27.1%). As a secondary outcome, at 24 hours, more patients in the \nbupivacaine group were headache free (24.7% difference; 95% CI 2.6% to 43.6%) \nand more were nausea free (16.9% difference; 95% CI 0.8% to 32.5%).\nCONCLUSION: For patients with acute anterior headache, sphenopalatine ganglion \nblock with the Tx360 device with bupivacaine did not result in a significant \nincrease in the proportion of patients achieving a greater than or equal to 50% \nreduction in headache severity at 15 minutes compared with saline solution \napplied in the same manner.",

This study was completed in 2 large academic \nEDs. Bupivacaine or normal saline solution was delivered intranasally (0.3 mL \nper side) with the Tx360 device. Pain and nausea were measured at 0, 5, and 15 \nminutes by a 100-mm visual analog scale. The primary endpoint was a 50% \nreduction in pain at 15 minutes. Telephone follow-up assessed 24-hour pain and \nnausea through a 0- to 10-point verbal scale and adverse effects.\nRESULTS: The median reported baseline pain in the bupivacaine group was 80 mm \n(IQR 66 mm - 93 mm) and 78.5 mm (IQR 64 mm to 91.75 mm) in the normal saline \nsolution group. A 50% reduction in pain was achieved in 48.8% of the bupivacaine \ngroup (20/41 patients) versus 41.3% in the normal saline solution group (19/46 \npatients), for an absolute risk difference of 7.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] \n-13% to 27.1%). At 24 hours, 24.7% more patients in the bupivacaine group were \nheadache free (95% CI 2.6% to 43.6%) and 16.9% more were nausea free (95% CI \n0.8% to 32.5%).\nCONCLUSION: Sphenopalatine ganglion block with bupivacaine was not more effective \non 50% reduction in pain at 15 minutes than normal saline solution in patients \nwith acute anterior headache.",

All patients had either a full-thickness or \nhigh-grade (>50%) RC tear, ACJ tenderness, arthritic change visible on plain \nradiographs, and a positive ACJ lidocaine injection test the day before surgery. \nPatients were randomized into 2 groups: DCR and RC repair (DCR+RCR group) and RC \nrepair only (isolated RCR). Evaluation was performed preoperatively, at 6 months \npostoperatively, and at a final follow-up a minimum of 24 months postoperatively \nusing the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, the Constant \nshoulder score, range of motion examination, and pain visual analog scale (VAS).\nRESULTS: After simple randomization, 26 shoulders were allocated in the DCR+RCR \ngroup, and 32 were placed in the isolated RCR group. Five shoulders in the \nDCR+RCR group and 6 in the isolated RCR group were excluded from analysis due to \nloss of follow-up. Therefore, the evaluation was performed for 21 shoulders in \nthe DCR+RCR group and 26 shoulders in the isolated RCR group. The mean follow-up \nperiod was 44.2 months in the DCR+RCR group and 44.0 months in the isolated RCR \ngroup. There were no differences in age, sex, symptom duration, RC tear size, or \npreoperative ASES, Constant, and VAS scores between the 2 groups (P > .05). At \nfinal follow-up, the ASES, Constant, and VAS scores were significantly improved \nin both groups (P < .001). There were no differences in ASES, Constant, and VAS \nscores between the 2 groups at final follow-up (P > .05), and there was no \ndifference in residual ACJ tenderness (7 in the DCR+RCR group and 5 in the \nisolated RCR group) between the 2 groups (P = .270).\nCONCLUSION: There was no difference in the clinical evaluations between the \ncombined arthroscopic DCR and RCR group and the isolated RCR group at a minimum \n24-month follow-up. Arthroscopic DCR should be carefully considered in patients \nwho have symptomatic ACJ arthritis with RC tears.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The treatment of symptomatic acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) injury in \nthe rotator cuff (RC) tear has not been well clarified.\nPURPOSE: To compare the clinical results between patients who had distal \nclavicle resection (DCR) and those who did not during RC repair.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\nMETHODS: From August 2008 to December 2009, a total of 56 consecutive patients \n(58 shoulders) were included. All patients had either a full-thickness or \nhigh-grade (>50%) RC tear, ACJ tenderness, arthritic change visible on plain \nradiographs, and a positive ACJ lidocaine injection test the day before surgery. \nPatients were randomized into 2 groups: DCR and RC repair (DCR+RCR group) and RC \nrepair only (isolated RCR). The primary outcome was the American Shoulder and \nElbow Surgeons (ASES) score. Secondary outcomes included the Constant shoulder \nscore, range of motion examination, and pain visual analog scale (VAS). \nEvaluation was performed preoperatively, at 6 months postoperatively, and at a \nfinal follow-up a minimum of 24 months postoperatively.\nRESULTS: After simple randomization, 26 shoulders were allocated in the DCR+RCR \ngroup, and 32 were placed in the isolated RCR group. Five shoulders in the \nDCR+RCR group and 6 in the isolated RCR group were excluded from analysis due to \nloss of follow-up. Therefore, the evaluation was performed for 21 shoulders in \nthe DCR+RCR group and 26 shoulders in the isolated RCR group. The mean follow-up \nperiod was 44.2 months in the DCR+RCR group and 44.0 months in the isolated RCR \ngroup. There were no differences in age, sex, symptom duration, RC tear size, or \npreoperative ASES, Constant, and VAS scores between the 2 groups (P > .05). At \nfinal follow-up, there were no differences in ASES, Constant, and VAS scores \nbetween the 2 groups (P > .05), and there was no difference in residual ACJ \ntenderness (7 in the DCR+RCR group and 5 in the isolated RCR group) between the \n2 groups (P = .270).\nCONCLUSION: DCR was not more effective on the ASES score than isolated RCR in \npatients with symptomatic ACJ arthritis and RC tears.",

A convenience sample of patients aged 18 to 59 years with acute abdominal, flank, low back, or extremity pain were enrolled. Subjects were consented and randomized to intravenous LDK (0.3mg/kg) or intravenous MOR (0.1mg/kg). Our primary outcome was the maximum change in NRS scores. Secondary outcomes included time to achieve maximum reduction in NRS pain scores, vital signs, adverse events, and provider and nurse satisfaction scores. A sample size of 20 subjects per group was calculated based on an 80% power to detect a 2-point change in NRS scores between treatment groups with estimated SDs of 2 and an \u03b1 of .05, using a repeated-measures linear model.\n\nResults: Forty-five subjects were enrolled (MOR 21, LDK 24). Demographic variables and baseline NRS scores (7.1 vs 7.1) were similar. Ketamine was not superior to MOR in the maximum change of NRS pain scores, MOR=5 (confidence interval, 6.6-3.5) and LDK=4.9 (confidence interval, 5.8-4). The time to achieve maximum reduction in NRS pain scores was at 5 minutes for LDK and 100 minutes for MOR. Vital signs, adverse events, provider, and nurse satisfaction scores were similar between groups.\n\nConclusion: Low-dose ketamine was not more effective on maximum change in NRS pain scores than morphine in patients with acute pain in the emergency department.",

Demographic variables and baseline NRS scores (7.1 vs 7.1) were similar. Ketamine was not superior to MOR in the maximum change of NRS pain scores, MOR=5 (confidence interval, 6.6-3.5) and LDK=4.9 (confidence interval, 5.8-4). The time to achieve maximum reduction in NRS pain scores was at 5 minutes for LDK and 100 minutes for MOR. Vital signs, adverse events, provider, and nurse satisfaction scores were similar between groups.\n\nConclusion: Low-dose ketamine did not produce a greater reduction in NRS pain scores compared with MOR for acute pain in the emergency department. However, LDK induced a significant analgesic effect within 5 minutes and provided a moderate reduction in pain for 2 hours.",

Delayed initiation of neuroprotective agents has hindered earlier phase 3 trials of neuroprotective agents.\n\nMethods: We randomly assigned patients with suspected stroke to receive either intravenous magnesium sulfate or placebo, beginning within 2 hours after symptom onset. A loading dose was initiated by paramedics before the patient arrived at the hospital, and a 24-hour maintenance infusion was started on the patient's arrival at the hospital. The primary outcome was the degree of disability at 90 days, as measured by scores on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater disability).\n\nResults: Among the 1700 enrolled patients (857 in the magnesium group and 843 in the placebo group), the mean (\u00b1SD) age was 69\u00b113 years, 42.6% were women, and the mean pretreatment score on the Los Angeles Motor Scale of stroke severity (range, 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater motor deficits) was 3.7\u00b11.3. The final diagnosis of the qualifying event was cerebral ischemia in 73.3% of patients, intracranial hemorrhage in 22.8%, and a stroke-mimicking condition in 3.9%. The median interval between the time the patient was last known to be free of stroke symptoms and the start of the study-drug infusion was 45 minutes (interquartile range, 35 to 62), and 74.3% of patients received the study-drug infusion within the first hour after symptom onset. There was no significant shift in the distribution of 90-day disability outcomes on the global modified Rankin scale between patients in the magnesium group and those in the placebo group (P=0.28 by the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test); mean scores at 90 days did not differ between the magnesium group and the placebo group (2.7 in each group, P=1.00). No significant between-group differences were noted with respect to mortality (15.4% in the magnesium group and 15.5% in the placebo group, P=0.95) or all serious adverse events.\n\nConclusions: Prehospital initiation of magnesium sulfate therapy was safe and allowed the start of therapy within 2 hours after the onset of stroke symptoms, but it did not improve disability outcomes at 90 days.",

        "abstract": "Background:\u0412\u00a0Component alignment can influence implant longevity as well as perhaps pain and function after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), but correct alignment is not consistently achieved. To increase the likelihood that good alignment will be achieved during surgery, smart tools such as robotics or patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) have been introduced.\nQuestions/purposes:\u0412\u00a0We hypothesized that UKA performed with PSI would result in improved level gait as ascertained with three-dimensional analysis, implant positioning, and patient-reported outcomes measured by a validated scoring system when compared with conventional instrumentation 3 months and 1 year after surgery.\nMethods:\u0412\u00a0We randomized 60 patients into two groups using either the PSI technique or a conventional technique. All patients were operated on using the same technique and the same cemented metal-backed implant. Mean age of the patients was 63 \u0412\u00b1 4 years (range, 54-72 years) and mean body mass index was 28 \u0412\u00b1 3 kg/m(2). Patients were evaluated preoperatively, at 3 months, and 1 year after surgery by an independent observer blind to the type of technique. Gait parameters were assessed with three-dimensional analysis during level walking preoperatively and at 1 year, frontal and sagittal position of the implant was evaluated on full-length radiographs at 3 months, and subjective functional outcome and quality of life using routine questionnaires (SF-12, new Knee Society Score [KSS], Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) at 3 months and 1 year. This study had 80% power to detect a 15% difference in walking speed at the p < 0.05 level.\nResults:\u0412\u00a0One year after surgery, there were no differences between the two groups in the analyzed gait spatiotemporal parameters, respectively, for PSI UKA and conventional UKA : double limb support 31% (25%-54%) versus 30% (23%-56%; p = 0.67) and walking speed (1.59 m/s [0.86-1.87 m/s] versus 1.57 m/s [0.71-1.96 m/s]; p = 0.41). No difference was observed between the two groups in terms of lower limb alignment (PSI group 178\u0412\u00b0 \u0412\u00b1 3\u0412\u00b0, conventional group 178\u0412\u00b0 \u0412\u00b1 4\u0412\u00b0; p = 0.24) or implant positioning on mediolateral and anteroposterior radiographs. There were no differences in the functional score between the PSI and conventional TKA groups at 3 months and 1 year after surgery: KSS objective knee scores (PSI: 85 \u0412\u00b1 8 points at 3 months, 87 \u0412\u00b1 5 points at 1 year and conventional instrumentation: 82 \u0412\u00b1 8 points at 3 months 83 \u0412\u00b1 6 points at 1 year; p = 0.10) and functional activity scores were similar in both group (PSI: 71 \u0412\u00b1 12 points at 3 months and 74 \u0412\u00b1 7 points at 1 year versus conventional group: 73 \u0412\u00b1 11 points at 3 months and 75 \u0412\u00b1 6 at 1 year; p = 0.9).\nConclusions:\u0412\u00a0Our observations suggest that PSI may confer small, if any, advantage in alignment, pain, or function after UKA. This argument can therefore not be used to justify the extra cost and uncertainty related to this technique.",

This trial was performed to assess the feasibility and safety of \ncontrolled resuscitation (CR) versus standard resuscitation (SR) in hypotensive \ntrauma patients.\nMETHODS: Patients were enrolled and randomized in the out-of-hospital setting. \nNineteen emergency medical services (EMS) systems in the Resuscitation Outcome \nConsortium participated. Eligible patients had an out-of-hospital systolic blood \npressure (SBP) of 90 mm Hg or lower. CR patients received 250 mL of fluid if \nthey had no radial pulse or an SBP lower than 70 mm Hg and additional 250-mL \nboluses to maintain a radial pulse or an SBP of 70 mm Hg or greater. The SR \ngroup patients received 2 L initially and additional fluid as needed to maintain \nan SBP of 110 mm Hg or greater. The crystalloid protocol was maintained until \nhemorrhage control or 2 hours after hospital arrival.\nRESULTS: A total of 192 patients were randomized (97 CR and 95 SR). The CR and \nSR groups were similar at baseline. The mean (SD) crystalloid volume \nadministered during the study period was 1.0 L (1.5) in the CR group and 2.0 L \n(1.4) in the SR group, a difference of 1.0 L (95% confidence interval [CI], \n0.6-1.4). Intensive care unit-free days, ventilator-free days, renal injury, and \nrenal failure did not differ between the groups.

Patients were randomized to receive ketamine \nat 0.3 mg/kg or morphine at 0.1 mg/kg by intravenous push during 3 to 5 minutes. \nEvaluations occurred at 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. Primary outcome was \nreduction in pain at 30 minutes. Secondary outcome was the incidence of rescue \nanalgesia at 30 and 60 minutes.\nRESULTS: Forty-five patients per group were enrolled in the study. The primary \nchange in mean pain scores was not significantly different in the ketamine and \nmorphine groups: 8.6 versus 8.5 at baseline (mean difference 0.1; 95% confidence \ninterval -0.46 to 0.77) and 4.1 versus 3.9 at 30 minutes (mean difference 0.2; \n95% confidence interval -1.19 to 1.46; P=.97). There was no difference in the \nincidence of rescue fentanyl analgesia at 30 or 60 minutes. No statistically \nsignificant or clinically concerning changes in vital signs were observed. No \nserious adverse events occurred in either group. Patients in the ketamine group \nreported increased minor adverse effects at 15 minutes post-drug administration.\nCONCLUSION: Subdissociative intravenous ketamine was not more effective than \nmorphine for reduction in pain at 30 minutes in ED patients with moderate to \nsevere acute pain.",

Patients were randomized to receive ketamine \nat 0.3 mg/kg or morphine at 0.1 mg/kg by intravenous push during 3 to 5 minutes. \nEvaluations occurred at 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. Primary outcome was \nreduction in pain at 30 minutes. Secondary outcome was the incidence of rescue \nanalgesia at 30 and 60 minutes.\nRESULTS: Forty-five patients per group were enrolled in the study. The primary \nchange in mean pain scores was not significantly different in the ketamine and \nmorphine groups: 8.6 versus 8.5 at baseline (mean difference 0.1; 95% confidence \ninterval -0.46 to 0.77) and 4.1 versus 3.9 at 30 minutes (mean difference 0.2; \n95% confidence interval -1.19 to 1.46; P=.97). There was no difference in the \nincidence of rescue fentanyl analgesia at 30 or 60 minutes. No statistically \nsignificant or clinically concerning changes in vital signs were observed. No \nserious adverse events occurred in either group. Patients in the ketamine group \nreported increased minor adverse effects at 15 minutes post-drug administration.\nCONCLUSION: Subdissociative intravenous ketamine administered at 0.3 mg/kg \nprovides analgesic effectiveness and apparent safety comparable to that of \nintravenous morphine for short-term treatment of acute pain in the ED.",

There is \nno standardised protocol for post-operative rehabilitation available. The \npurpose of this study was to compare two post-operative rehabilitation protocols \nafter open wedge HTO.\nMETHODS: One hundred and twenty consecutive patients with varus malalignment and \nmedial compartment osteoarthritis received an open wedge HTO using an angular \nlocking plate fixation between December 2008 and December 2011. All patients \nwere assigned randomly into one of two groups with different post-operative \nrehabilitation protocols (11-day vs. 6-week 20-kg partial weight-bearing). \nClinical outcome was evaluated using established instruments (Lequesne, Lysholm, \nHSS and IKDC scores) preoperatively, 6, 12 and 18 months post-operatively. \nDeformity analysis was performed preoperatively and during follow-up.\nRESULTS: All clinical scores showed a significant pre- to post-operative \nimprovement. After 6 months, there was a higher improvement in the group of \nearly full weight-bearing. The difference between preoperative and 6-month \nfollow-up for the group with early full weight-bearing and for the group with \n20-kg PWB for 6 weeks was 28 \u00b1 26 and 18 \u00b1 22, respectively, for the Lysholm \nscore and -5.0 \u00b1 5.1 and -3.0 \u00b1 3.6, respectively, for the Lequesne score.\nCONCLUSIONS: The study did not establish a clear primary outcome measure to \ndefinitively determine whether early full weight-bearing was more effective than \n6-week partial weight-bearing in patients with varus malalignment and medial \ncompartment osteoarthritis undergoing open wedge HTO.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Open wedge high tibial osteotomy is a widespread treatment option in \npatients with varus malalignment and medial compartment osteoarthritis. There is \nno standardised protocol for post-operative rehabilitation available. The \npurpose of this study was to compare two post-operative rehabilitation protocols \nand to evaluate the clinical outcome of early full weight-bearing after open \nwedge HTO.\nMETHODS: One hundred and twenty consecutive patients with varus malalignment and \nmedial compartment osteoarthritis received an open wedge HTO using an angular \nlocking plate fixation between December 2008 and December 2011. All patients \nwere assigned randomly into one of two groups with different post-operative \nrehabilitation protocols (11-day vs. 6-week 20-kg partial weight-bearing). \nClinical outcome was evaluated using established instruments (Lequesne, Lysholm, \nHSS and IKDC scores) preoperatively, 6, 12 and 18\u0412\u00a0months post-operatively. \nDeformity analysis was performed preoperatively and during follow-up.\nRESULTS: All clinical scores showed a significant pre- to post-operative \nimprovement. After 6\u0412\u00a0months, there was a higher improvement in the group of \nearly full weight-bearing. The difference between preoperative and 6-month \nfollow-up for the group with early full weight-bearing and for the group with \n20-kg PWB for 6\u0412\u00a0weeks was 28\u0412\u00a0\u0412\u00b1\u0412\u00a026 and 18\u0412\u00a0\u0412\u00b1\u0412\u00a022, respectively, for the Lysholm \nscore and -5.0\u0412\u00a0\u0412\u00b1\u0412\u00a05.1 and -3.0\u0412\u00a0\u0412\u00b1\u0412\u00a03.6, respectively, for the Lequesne score.\nCONCLUSIONS: Early full weight-bearing (11-day 20-kg partial weight-bearing) \nafter open wedge HTO without bone graft leads to earlier improvement of the \nclinical results and can be recommended for post-operative rehabilitation after \nopen wedge HTO and fixation with an angular locking plate.",

However, the mean total number of dressings used was \nsignificantly more in the SSD group (14.0) compared with the Mepilex Ag group \n(3.06, p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in the time until skin \ngraft was performed between the two study groups.\nCONCLUSION: There was no difference in healing rates between Mepilex Ag and SSD, \nwith both products well tolerated. The longer wear time of Mepilex Ag promotes \nundisturbed healing and makes it easier for patients to continue with their \nnormal lives sooner.",

Haloperidol has been shown to \nbe effective for migraine treatment.\nSTUDY OBJECTIVE: Our study compared the use of metoclopramide vs. haloperidol to \ntreat ED migraine patients.\nMETHODS: A prospective, double-blinded, randomized control trial of 64 adults \naged 18-50 years with migraine headache and no recognized risks for \nQT-prolongation. Haloperidol 5 mg or metoclopramide 10 mg was given \nintravenously after 25 mg diphenhydramine. Pain, nausea, restlessness \n(akathisia), and sedation were assessed with 100-mm visual analog scales (VAS) \nat baseline and every 20 min, to a maximum of 80 min. The primary outcome was \npain relief. The need for rescue medications, side effects, and subject \nsatisfaction were recorded. QTc intervals were measured prior to and after \ntreatment. Follow-up calls after 48 h assessed satisfaction and recurrent or \npersistent symptoms.\nRESULTS: Thirty-one subjects received haloperidol, 33 metoclopramide. The groups \nwere similar on all VAS measurements, side effects, and in their satisfaction \nwith therapy. Pain relief averaged 53 mm VAS over both groups, with equal times \nto maximum improvement. Subjects receiving haloperidol required rescue \nmedication less often (3% vs. 24%, p < 0.02). Mean QTcs were equal \nand normal in the two groups and did not change after treatment. In telephone \nfollow-up, 90% of subjects contacted were \"happy with the medication\" they had \nreceived, with haloperidol-treated subjects experiencing more restlessness (43% \nvs. 10%).\nCONCLUSIONS: Haloperidol was not more effective on pain relief than metoclopramide \nin patients with migraine headaches.",

A significant difference (P=.042) between the MB-TKA inserts was found in KSS function scores, but clinical significance is expected to be limited. Goniometry, temporal gait parameters and QoL were similar in all groups. Survival was significantly better (P=.047) for FB-TKA.

In this prospective, blinded study, liposomal bupivacaine was randomized against bupivacaine and incorporated into a comprehensive multimodal pain management protocol. 111 primary TKAs were randomized to receive PAI: 58 patients received 266 mg (20cc) liposomal bupivacaine mixed with 75 mg (30cc) 0.25% bupivacaine, and 53 patients received 150 mg (60cc) 0.25% bupivacaine. Visual analog pain scores and narcotic use were determined. No pain score differences occurred between study and control patients: Day 1: 4.5/4.6 (P=0.73); Day 2: 4.4/4.8 (P=0.27); or Day 3: 3.5/3.7 (P=0.58). Narcotic use was similar during hospitalization, 51.8/54.2 (P=0.34). The study medication costs $285, and the control medication costs $2.80.

In this prospective, blinded study, liposomal bupivacaine was randomized against bupivacaine and incorporated into a comprehensive multimodal pain management protocol. 111 primary TKAs were randomized to receive PAI: 58 patients received 266 mg (20cc) liposomal bupivacaine mixed with 75 mg (30cc) 0.25% bupivacaine, and 53 patients received 150 mg (60cc) 0.25% bupivacaine. Visual analog pain scores and narcotic use were determined. No pain score differences occurred between study and control patients: Day 1: 4.5/4.6 (P=0.73); Day 2: 4.4/4.8 (P=0.27); or Day 3: 3.5/3.7 (P=0.58). Narcotic use was similar during hospitalization, 51.8/54.2 (P=0.34). The study medication costs $285, and the control medication costs $2.80. Liposomal bupivacaine was not more effective than bupivacaine in patients undergoing primary TKA.",

Computed \ntomography scan evaluation was performed in all patients preoperatively and at 1 \nyear postoperatively to assess preoperative fatty infiltration of the rotator \ncuff and bony integration of the graft postoperatively.\nRESULTS: At final follow-up, all patients showed significantly increased \nfunctional results. There were no significant differences in the evaluated \nparameters. If patients with degenerative changes of the teres minor were \nexcluded, the lateralized group showed significantly increased external \nrotation. Bony integration of the graft could be verified on postoperative \ncomputed tomography scans in all patients.\nCONCLUSION: RSA with bony lateralization shows a trend toward improved external \nrotation in lateralized RSA, with a statistically significant improvement in \nexternal rotation in patients with an intact teres minor.",

Computed tomography scan evaluation was performed in all patients preoperatively and at 1 year postoperatively to assess preoperative fatty infiltration of the rotator cuff and bony integration of the graft postoperatively.\n\nRESULTS: At final follow-up, there were no significant differences in the evaluated parameters between the lateralized and non-lateralized groups. Bony integration of the graft could be verified on postoperative computed tomography scans in all patients.\n\nCONCLUSION: Lateralized RSA was not more effective than non-lateralized RSA in patients with cuff tear arthropathy.",

It also \nevaluates the need for additional doses of analgesics in the first 24 hours of \ndischarge from emergency department (ED).\nMETHODS: Adult (>18 years old) patients with soft tissue injuries were enrolled \nin a teaching urban ED. Subjects were randomly allocated to receive a single \ndose of oral oxycodone (5 mg) or oral naproxen (250 mg). Pain scores and drugs' \nadverse effects were assessed before, 30 minutes, and 60 minutes after \nmedication.\nOUTCOME: efficacy in pain control (reduction in pain scale >2 points) and safety \n(rate of side effects). The need for additional pain medication after discharge \nwas assessed by follow-up phone call 24 hours after discharge.\nRESULTS: A total of 150 patients were enrolled. Pain scores were similar in \noxycodone vs naproxen groups before (6.21 \u0412\u00b1 0.9 in vs 6.0 \u0412\u00b1 1.0), 30 minutes \n(4.5 \u0412\u00b1 1.4 vs 4.4 \u0412\u00b1 1.2), and 60 minutes (2.5 \u0412\u00b1 1.3 in vs 2.6 \u0412\u00b1 1.3) after \nmedication, respectively. Twelve (16.0%) patients in oral oxycodone group and 5 \n(6.6%) patients in naproxen group needed more analgesics in first 24 hours after \nED discharge. Adverse effects were more common in oxycodone group (statistically \nsignificant difference). The most common adverse effects in oxycodone group were \nnausea, (13.3%); vomiting, (8.0%); dizziness, (5.3%); drowsiness, 3 (4.0%); and \npruritis, (2.7%).\nCONCLUSION: Oral oxycodone is as effective as naproxen in soft tissue injury \npain control but has a less favorable safety profile.",

No long-term results have \nbeen published comparing tibialis posterior allografts to hamstring autografts.\nPURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term results of primary ACL reconstruction using \neither an allograft or autograft.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\nMETHODS: From June 2002 to August 2003, patients with a symptomatic \nACL-deficient knee were randomized to receive either a hamstring autograft or \ntibialis posterior allograft. All allografts were from a single tissue bank, \naseptically processed, and fresh-frozen without terminal irradiation. Graft \nfixation was identical in all knees. All patients followed the same \npostoperative rehabilitation protocol, which was blinded to the therapists. \nPreoperative and postoperative assessments were performed via examination and/or \ntelephone and Internet-based questionnaire to ascertain the functional and \nsubjective status using established knee metrics. The primary outcome measures \nwere graft integrity, subjective knee stability, and functional status.\nRESULTS: There were 99 patients (100 knees); 86 were men, and 95% were \nactive-duty military. Both groups were similar in demographics and preoperative \nactivity level. The mean and median ages of both groups were identical at 29 and \n26 years, respectively. Concomitant meniscal and chondral pathologic \nabnormalities, microfracture, and meniscal repair performed at the time of \nreconstruction were similar in both groups. At a minimum of 10 years (range, \n120-132 months) from surgery, 96 patients (97 knees) were contacted (2 patients \nwere deceased, and 1 was unable to be located). There were 4 (8.3%) autograft \nand 13 (26.5%) allograft failures that required revision reconstruction. In the \nremaining patients whose graft was intact, there was no difference in the mean \nSingle Assessment Numeric Evaluation, Tegner, or International Knee \nDocumentation Committee scores.\nCONCLUSION: Allograft was not more effective than autograft in patients with \nACL-deficient knees.",

Neurological adverse events included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, \nhemicraniectomy, neurological deterioration and neurological death. \nCardiopulmonary adverse events included pulmonary edema/congestive heart \nfailure, acute coronary syndromes, atrial fibrillation, pneumonia and pulmonary \nthromboembolism.\nRESULTS: Among 830 patients, the rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in the first \n24h was 2.9% (24/830) and was more common in the ALB treated subjects \n(RR = 2.4, CI95 1.01-5.8). The rate of pulmonary edema/CHF in the first 48h was \n7.9% (59/830) and was more common among ALB treated subjects (RR = 10.7, CI95 \n4.3-26.6).

We sought to describe the neurological and \ncardiopulmonary adverse events in the ALIAS Part 2 Multicenter Trial.\nMETHODS: Ischemic stroke patients, aged 18-83 and a baseline NIHSS \u0432\u2030\u0490 6, were \nrandomized to treatment with ALB or saline control within 5 hours of stroke \nonset. Neurological adverse events included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, \nhemicraniectomy, neurological deterioration and neurological death. \nCardiopulmonary adverse events included pulmonary edema/congestive heart \nfailure, acute coronary syndromes, atrial fibrillation, pneumonia and pulmonary \nthromboembolism.\nRESULTS: Among 830 patients, neurological and cardiopulmonary adverse events \nwere not differentially associated with poor outcome between ALB and saline \ncontrol subjects. The rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in the first \n24h was low overall (2.9%, 24/830) but more common in the ALB treated subjects \n(RR = 2.4, CI95 1.01-5.8). The rate of pulmonary edema/CHF in the first 48h was \n7.9% (59/830) and was more common among ALB treated subjects (RR = 10.7, CI95 \n4.3-26.6); this complication was expected and was satisfactorily managed with \nmandated diuretic administration and intravenous fluid guidelines. Troponin \nelevations in the first 48h were common, occurring without ECG change or cardiac \nsymptoms in 52 subjects (12.5%).\nCONCLUSIONS: ALB therapy was associated with an increase in symptomatic ICH and \npulmonary edema/congestive heart failure but this did not affect final outcomes. \nTroponin elevation occurs routinely in the first 48 hours after acute ischemic \nstroke.",

High-frequency, low-magnitude vibration has \nbeen demonstrated to promote new bone formation in both animal models and in \nhumans.\nHYPOTHESIS: This type of mechanical stimulation applied postoperatively will \nenhance tendon-to-bone healing and reduce postoperative retear rates.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\nMETHODS: A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was \nconducted to investigate the effects of 5 minutes of 80-Hz vibration applied \ndaily after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair for 6 months on postoperative \nrotator cuff healing. The primary outcome was ultrasound-assessed repair \nintegrity at 6 months after repair. Secondary outcomes included pain scores, \nshoulder range of motion, and shoulder strength. Recruited patients were randomized into 2 \ngroups: one group received a vibration device that oscillated at 80 Hz, and the \nother group received a placebo device.\nRESULTS: The postoperative retear rates were 9.1% (5/55) \nin the vibration group, and 9.3% (5/54) in the placebo group at 6 months as \ndetermined by ultrasound imaging. Pain scores at 6 \nweeks after surgery were 2.24 \u00b1 0.29 cm in the vibration group compared \nwith 3.67 \u00b1 0.48 cm in the placebo group (P < .003). Six months after surgery, \nboth groups had reductions in pain during overhead activities, at \nrest, and during sleep and overall shoulder pain compared with before surgery (P \n< .001). Both the vibration and placebo groups had increases in \nshoulder strength with abduction in the scapular plane, adduction, liftoff, \ninternal rotation, and external rotation 6 months after surgery. Statistical \nanalysis showed that vibration was not a contributing factor at improving these \nparameters in these periods.\nCONCLUSION: Vibration was not more effective than placebo on repair integrity in patients with rotator cuff tears.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rotator cuff repair is a common method to treat rotator cuff tears; \nhowever, retear rates remain high. High-frequency, low-magnitude vibration has \nbeen demonstrated to promote new bone formation in both animal models and in \nhumans.\nHYPOTHESIS: This type of mechanical stimulation applied postoperatively will \nenhance tendon-to-bone healing and reduce postoperative retear rates.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\nMETHODS: A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was \nconducted to investigate the effects of 5 minutes of 80-Hz vibration applied \ndaily after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair for 6 months on postoperative \nrotator cuff healing. The primary outcome was ultrasound-assessed repair \nintegrity at 6 months after repair. Recruited patients were randomized into 2 \ngroups: one group received a vibration device that oscillated at 80 Hz, and the \nother group received a placebo device.\nRESULTS: The postoperative retear rates of both groups were similar (9.1% [5/55] \nin the vibration group, and 9.3% [5/54] in the placebo group) at 6 months as \ndetermined by ultrasound imaging. Vibration did provide acute pain relief at 6 \nweeks after surgery (visual analog scale [VAS] score, 2.24 \u0412\u00b1 0.29 cm) compared \nwith placebo (VAS score, 3.67 \u0412\u00b1 0.48 cm) (P < .003). Six months after surgery, \nboth groups had significant reductions in pain during overhead activities, at \nrest, and during sleep and overall shoulder pain compared with before surgery (P \n< .001). Both the vibration and placebo groups had significant increases in \nshoulder strength with abduction in the scapular plane, adduction, liftoff, \ninternal rotation, and external rotation 6 months after surgery. Statistical \nanalysis showed that vibration was not a contributing factor at improving these \nparameters in these periods.\nCONCLUSION: High-frequency, low-magnitude vibration did provide acute pain \nrelief on application 6 weeks after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair surgery. \nHowever, vibration did not improve tendon-to-bone healing, shoulder range of \nmotion, shoulder strength, or shoulder pain with activities, at rest, and at \nnight when compared with placebo.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Arthroscopy has become a standard method of treatment for a variety \nof intra-articular hip disorders. While most arthroscopic hip procedures are \nperformed as outpatient surgeries, patients can still experience significant \npostoperative pain and opioid-associated side effects.\nPURPOSE: The potential benefits of a preoperative femoral nerve block (FNB) in \nhip arthroscopy were explored in a previous retrospective review. The study \nobjective was to confirm these findings in a prospective randomized study.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\nMETHODS: Fifty patients undergoing hip arthroscopy were included in this \nprospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial that was patient-, \noperator-, and assessor-blinded. Patients received either a preoperative \nultrasound-guided FNB with 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine (FNB group) or normal \nsaline (control group). Nerve blockade was confirmed via standardized sensory \ntesting before the induction of general anesthesia. The primary endpoint was \ncumulative consumption of oral morphine equivalent at 24 hours after discharge. \nSecondary endpoints included opioid use at various time points, pain scores, \nQuality of Recovery (QoR-27) score, incidence of nausea and vomiting, time to \ndischarge, block-related complications, falls at 24 hours, and patient \nsatisfaction.\nRESULTS: Fifty patients completed the study, including 27 in the FNB group and \n23 in the control group. Most patient characteristics were statistically similar \nbetween groups except for operative time, which was longer in the control group. \nCumulative oral morphine consumption was lower in the FNB group at 48 hours; \nthere was no difference at 24 hours or 7 days postoperatively. Pain scores were \nsignificantly lower up to 6 hours postoperatively in the FNB group compared with \ncontrol; however, rebound pain was observed at 24 hours after discharge in \npatients who received FNB. There was no difference in most secondary outcomes. \nImportantly, a total of 6 patients in the FNB group reported falls (without \ninjury) within the first 24 hours postoperatively compared with none in the \ncontrol group. Patient satisfaction with pain control was high in both groups at \nall time points.\nCONCLUSION: Preoperative FNB may improve early pain control after hip \narthroscopy. However, given the observed risk of falls, the routine use of FNB \nfor outpatient hip arthroscopy cannot be recommended.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Trials demonstrate significant clinical benefit in patients \nreceiving therapeutic hypothermia (TH) after cardiac arrest. However, incidence \nof mortality and morbidity remains high in this patient group. Rapid targeted \nbrain hypothermia induction, together with prompt correction of the underlying \ncause may improve outcomes in these patients. This study investigates the \nefficacy of Rhinochill, an intranasal cooling device over Blanketrol, a surface \ncooling device in inducing TH in cardiac arrest patients within the cardiac \ncatheter laboratory.\nMETHODS: 70 patients were randomized to TH induction with either Rhinochill or \nBlanketrol. Primary outcome measures were time to reach tympanic \u0432\u2030\u00a434 \u0412\u00b0C from \nrandomisation as a surrogate for brain temperature and oesophageal \u0432\u2030\u00a434 \u0412\u00b0C from \nrandomisation as a measurement of core body temperature. Secondary outcomes \nincluded first hour temperature drop, length of stay in intensive care unit, \nhospital stay, neurological recovery and all-cause mortality at hospital \ndischarge.\nRESULTS: There was no difference in time to reach \u0432\u2030\u00a434 \u0412\u00b0C between Rhinochill and \nBlanketrol (Tympanic \u0432\u2030\u00a434 \u0412\u00b0C, 75 vs. 107 mins; p=0.101; Oesophageal \u0432\u2030\u00a434 \u0412\u00b0C, 85 \nvs. 115 mins; p=0.151). Tympanic temperature dropped significantly with \nRhinochill in the first hour (1.75 vs. 0.94 \u0412\u00b0C; p<0.001). No difference was \ndetected in any other secondary outcome measures. Catheter laboratory-based TH \ninduction resulted in a survival to hospital discharge of 67.1%.\nCONCLUSION: In this study, Rhinochill was not found to be more efficient than \nBlanketrol for TH induction, although there was a non-significant trend in \nfavour of Rhinochill that potentially warrants further investigation with a \nlarger trial.",

        "abstract": "Background: Olecranon bursitis might be a minor problem in the outpatient clinic but relatively be common to occur. However, there are few well-designed studies comparing approaches to treatment.\n\nQuestions/purposes: (1) Which treatment (compression bandaging with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], aspiration, or aspiration with steroid injections) is associated with the highest likelihood of resolution of nonseptic olecranon bursitis? (2) Which treatment is associated with earliest resolution of symptoms? (3) What factors are associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks?\n\nMethods: We enrolled 133 patients from two centers; after applying prespecified exclusions (septic bursitis or concomitant inflammatory arthritis, intraarticular elbow pathology, recent aspiration or steroid injection done elsewhere, and refusal to participate), 90 patients were randomly allocated to receive compression bandaging with NSAIDs (C), aspiration (A), or aspiration with steroid injection (AS) groups (30 patients in each). The groups were similar at baseline in terms of age and gender. Seven patients (four from Group A and three from Group AS) were lost to followup. All patients were followed up weekly for 4 weeks, and the same treatment procedure was repeated if the bursitis recurred with any substantial fluid collection. At 4 weeks, the state of resolution and pain visual analog scale (VAS) were evaluated. Failed resolution was defined as presence of persistent olecranon bursal fluid collection at Week 4 after the initiation of the treatment; on the contrary, if bursal fluid collection was clinically reduced or completely disappeared by the end of Week 4, the treatment was considered successful. We compared the proportion of resolution by Week 4 and the median times to resolution among the treatment groups. In addition, we evaluated whether the resolution affected pain VAS and what factors were associated with the resolution.\n\nResults: There were no differences in the proportion of patients whose bursitis resolved by Week 4 among the three treatment groups (Group C: 25 of 30 [83%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.27-1.72], p = 0.580; Group A: 17 of 26 [65%], relative risk of resolution failure: 2.19 [95% CI, 0.98-4.87], p = 0.083; Group AS: 23 of 27 [85%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.59 [95% CI, 0.22-1.63], p = 0.398) (p = 0.073). Steroid injection after aspiration (Group AS) was associated with the earliest resolution (2.3 weeks [range, 1-4 weeks]) when compared with aspiration alone (Group A; 3.1 weeks [range, 2-4 weeks]) and compression bandaging with NSAIDs (Group C; 3.2 weeks [range, 2-4 weeks]), p = 0.015). Longer duration of symptoms before treatment was the only factor associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks (failed resolution: 6 weeks [range, 2-9 weeks]; successful resolution: 4 weeks [range, 0.4-6 weeks]; p = 0.008).\n\nConclusions: With the numbers available, there were no differences in efficacy when compression bandaging with NSAIDs, aspiration, and aspiration with steroid injection were compared. However, we were powered only to detect a 30% difference, meaning that if there were a smaller difference in efficacy among the groups, we might not have detected it in a study of this size. Our data can be used as pilot data to power future prospective (and likely multicenter) trials. Because olecranon bursitis can recur, and because treatments like aspiration and aspiration with steroid injection can cause complications, unless future trials demonstrate clear efficacy advantages of aspiration and/or injection both at short and longer terms, we suggest that compression bandaging and a short course of NSAIDs may offer the most appropriate balance of safety and efficacy.",

        "abstract": "Background: Olecranon bursitis might be a minor problem in the outpatient clinic but relatively be common to occur. However, there are few well-designed studies comparing approaches to treatment.\n\nQuestions/purposes: (1) Which treatment (compression bandaging with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], aspiration, or aspiration with steroid injections) is associated with the highest likelihood of resolution of nonseptic olecranon bursitis? (2) Which treatment is associated with earliest resolution of symptoms? (3) What factors are associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks?\n\nMethods: We enrolled 133 patients from two centers; after applying prespecified exclusions (septic bursitis or concomitant inflammatory arthritis, intraarticular elbow pathology, recent aspiration or steroid injection done elsewhere, and refusal to participate), 90 patients were randomly allocated to receive compression bandaging with NSAIDs (C), aspiration (A), or aspiration with steroid injection (AS) groups (30 patients in each). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients whose bursitis resolved by Week 4. Secondary outcomes included time to resolution, pain visual analog scale (VAS), and factors associated with treatment failure. The groups were similar at baseline in terms of age and gender. Seven patients (four from Group A and three from Group AS) were lost to followup. All patients were followed up weekly for 4 weeks, and the same treatment procedure was repeated if the bursitis recurred with any substantial fluid collection. At 4 weeks, the state of resolution and pain visual analog scale (VAS) were evaluated. Failed resolution was defined as presence of persistent olecranon bursal fluid collection at Week 4 after the initiation of the treatment; on the contrary, if bursal fluid collection was clinically reduced or completely disappeared by the end of Week 4, the treatment was considered successful. We compared the proportion of resolution by Week 4 and the median times to resolution among the treatment groups. In addition, we evaluated whether the resolution affected pain VAS and what factors were associated with the resolution.\n\nResults: There were no differences in the proportion of patients whose bursitis resolved by Week 4 among the three treatment groups (Group C: 25 of 30 [83%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.27-1.72], p = 0.580; Group A: 17 of 26 [65%], relative risk of resolution failure: 2.19 [95% CI, 0.98-4.87], p = 0.083; Group AS: 23 of 27 [85%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.59 [95% CI, 0.22-1.63], p = 0.398) (p = 0.073). Time to resolution was 2.3 weeks (range, 1-4 weeks) for Group AS, 3.1 weeks (range, 2-4 weeks) for Group A, and 3.2 weeks (range, 2-4 weeks) for Group C (p = 0.015). Longer duration of symptoms before treatment was associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks (failed resolution: 6 weeks [range, 2-9 weeks]; successful resolution: 4 weeks [range, 0.4-6 weeks]; p = 0.008).\n\nConclusions: Compression bandaging with NSAIDs was not more effective than aspiration or aspiration with steroid injection in patients with nonseptic olecranon bursitis for the primary outcome of resolution by 4 weeks.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: The aim of the present study was to examine changes in radiological variables in a prospective randomized study comparing opening wedge (OW) and closing wedge (CW) techniques of high tibial osteotomy (HTO). Our hypothesis was that there would be no differences in joint line angles or correction accuracy between the two groups, that patellar height would increase after CW HTO and decrease after OW HTO, and that leg length and posterior tibial slope would decrease after CW HTO and increase after OW HTO.\n\nMethods: Radiological data were collected from 70 patients participating in an ongoing prospective randomized clinical trial comparing OW and CW HTOs. Digital standing hip-knee-ankle (HKA) radiographs as well as lateral radiographs in 30\u040e of flexion were obtained preoperatively and at 6 months for each patient. Joint line angles, HKA angle, leg length, Insall-Salvati index, Miura-Kawamura index and posterior tibial slope were measured using medical planning software. The complete preoperative radiological examinations of the first 50 patients were used in a study of intra- and inter-rater reliability of the measurements.\n\nResults: The mean posterior slope was reduced by 2.5\u040e in CW HTO, whereas it remained unchanged in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Mean leg length decreased 5.7 mm in CW HTO and increased 3.1 mm in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Changes in joint line angles, patellar height indexes and the correction accuracy showed no significant differences comparing the two techniques. Frontal plane reliability measurement intra- and inter-rater intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) varied from 0.81 to 0.99. Sagittal plane intra- and inter-rater ICC varied from 0.60 to 0.87. Posterior tibial slope intra- and inter-rater ICC showed the lowest values (0.70 and 0.60, respectively) corresponding to a smallest real difference of 4.5\u040e and 5.5\u040e, respectively.\n\nConclusions: Posterior tibial slope and leg length changes were significantly different in CW compared to OW HTOs. We recommend that possible alterations in tibial slope and leg length are considered when the technique of HTO is to be chosen. Landmark-based medical planning software shows good reliability and can be used in preoperative planning and postoperative evaluations of HTOs.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: The aim of the present study was to examine changes in radiological variables in a prospective randomized study comparing opening wedge (OW) and closing wedge (CW) techniques of high tibial osteotomy (HTO). Our hypothesis was that there would be no differences in joint line angles or correction accuracy between the two groups, that patellar height would increase after CW HTO and decrease after OW HTO, and that leg length and posterior tibial slope would decrease after CW HTO and increase after OW HTO.\n\nMethods: Radiological data were collected from 70 patients participating in an ongoing prospective randomized clinical trial comparing OW and CW HTOs. Digital standing hip-knee-ankle (HKA) radiographs as well as lateral radiographs in 30\u00b0 of flexion were obtained preoperatively and at 6 months for each patient. Joint line angles, HKA angle, leg length, Insall-Salvati index, Miura-Kawamura index and posterior tibial slope were measured using medical planning software. The complete preoperative radiological examinations of the first 50 patients were used in a study of intra- and inter-rater reliability of the measurements.\n\nResults: The mean posterior slope was reduced by 2.5\u00b0 in CW HTO, whereas it remained unchanged in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Mean leg length decreased 5.7 mm in CW HTO and increased 3.1 mm in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Changes in joint line angles, patellar height indexes and the correction accuracy showed no significant differences comparing the two techniques. Frontal plane reliability measurement intra- and inter-rater intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) varied from 0.81 to 0.99. Sagittal plane intra- and inter-rater ICC varied from 0.60 to 0.87. Posterior tibial slope intra- and inter-rater ICC showed the lowest values (0.70 and 0.60, respectively) corresponding to a smallest real difference of 4.5\u00b0 and 5.5\u00b0, respectively.\n\nConclusions: Opening wedge HTO was not more effective than closing wedge HTO in patients undergoing high tibial osteotomy for radiological variables including joint line angles, correction accuracy, and patellar height indexes.",

We examine whether using a \nnoninvasive protocol would result in more rapid lactate clearance after 3 hours \nin patients with severe sepsis and septic shock in the emergency department.\nMETHODS: In this open-label randomized controlled trial, 122 adult patients with \nsepsis and serum lactate concentration of greater than or equal to 3.0 mmol/L \nwere randomized to receive usual care or intravenous fluid bolus administration \nguided by measurements of change of stroke volume index, using the noninvasive \ncardiac output monitor after passive leg-raising maneuver. The primary outcome \nwas lactate clearance of more than 20% at 3 hours. Secondary outcomes included \nmortality, length of hospital and ICU stay, and total hospital cost. Analysis \nwas intention to treat.\nRESULTS: Similar proportions of patients in the randomized intervention group \n(70.5%; N=61) versus control group (73.8%; N=61) achieved the primary outcome, \nwith a relative risk of 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77 to 1.19). \nSecondary outcomes were similar in both groups (P>.05 for all comparisons). \nHospital mortality occurred in 6 patients (9.8%) each in the intervention and \ncontrol groups on or before 28 days (relative risk=1.00; 95% CI 0.34 to 2.93).\nCONCLUSION: The noninvasive cardiac output monitor and passive leg-raising \nmaneuver protocol was not more effective than usual care for lactate clearance \nin patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.",

We examine whether using a \nnoninvasive protocol would result in more rapid lactate clearance after 3 hours \nin patients with severe sepsis and septic shock in the emergency department.\nMETHODS: In this open-label randomized controlled trial, 122 adult patients with \nsepsis and serum lactate concentration of greater than or equal to 3.0 mmol/L \nwere randomized to receive usual care or intravenous fluid bolus administration \nguided by measurements of change of stroke volume index, using the noninvasive \ncardiac output monitor after passive\u0412\u00a0leg-raising maneuver. The primary outcome \nwas lactate clearance of more than 20% at 3 hours. Secondary outcomes included \nmortality, length of hospital and ICU stay, and total hospital cost. Analysis \nwas intention to treat.\nRESULTS: Similar proportions of patients in the randomized intervention group \n(70.5%; N=61) versus control group (73.8%; N=61) achieved the primary outcome, \nwith a relative risk of 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77 to 1.19). \nSecondary outcomes were similar in both groups (P>.05 for all comparisons). \nHospital mortality occurred in 6 patients (9.8%) each in the intervention and \ncontrol groups on or before 28 days (relative risk=1.00; 95% CI 0.34 to 2.93). \nAmong a subgroup of patients with underlying fluid overload states, those in the \nintervention group tended to receive clinically significantly more intravenous \nfluids at 3 hours (difference=975 mL; 95% CI -450 to 1,725 mL) and attained \nbetter lactate clearance (difference=19.7%; 95% CI -34.6% to 60.2%) compared \nwith the control group, with shorter hospital lengths of stay (difference=-4.5 \ndays; 95% CI -9.5 to 2.5 days).\nCONCLUSION: Protocol-based fluid resuscitation of patients with severe sepsis \nand septic shock with the noninvasive cardiac output monitor and passive \nleg-raising maneuver did not result in better outcomes compared with usual care. \nFuture studies to demonstrate the use of the noninvasive protocol-based care in \npatients with preexisting fluid overload states may be warranted.",

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is potent antifibrinolytic agent, routinely administered by intravenous (IV) and topical route, which can possibly interrupt cascade of events due to hemostatic irregularities close to source of bleeding. However, scientific evidence of combined administration of TXA in TKA is still meagre. The present study aimed to compare efficacy of combined IV and topical TXA with IV use alone in terms of blood loss, transfusion rate, and incidence of deep vein thrombosis and thromboembolism.\nPatients and methods:\u0412\u00a0119 patients undergoing unilateral TKA were randomized into IV alone and combined group. Patients assigned to IV group were given IV TXA as a preoperative and postoperative dose given 3 and 6 hours after surgery, whereas in combined group, topical TXA solution was applied intraarticularly about 5 minutes before closure of arthrotomy in addition to IV doses.\nResults:\u0412\u00a0Combined use of IV and topical TXA provided better results than IV use alone with mean calculated total blood loss (590.69\u0412\u00b1191.1 vs 385.68\u0412\u00b1182.5, P<.001), blood transfusion rate (6.6% vs 1.6%, P = .364), hemoglobin drop (1.82\u0412\u00b10.6 vs 1.14\u0412\u00b10.5, P<.001). No case of DVT or TE was noted among the 2 study groups.\nConclusion:\u0412\u00a0Combined use of IV and intraarticular TXA provided significantly better results compared with IV use alone with respect to all variables related to postoperative blood loss in TKA. Moreover, TXA use is safe in terms of incidence of symptomatic DVT and TE.",

The primary and secondary outcome measures were insulin sensitivity assessed using a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test and hepatic triglyceride content with magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Exploratory outcomes were cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity and MRI and dual x-ray absorptiometry-derived measures of adiposity.\n\nResults: The study had 96% retention and attendance was 61\u00b121% and 55\u00b124% in the high- and moderate-intensity ET arms. Intention-to-treat analyses revealed that, at follow-up, insulin sensitivity was not different between high-intensity (-1.0 mU kg(-1) min(-1); 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.6, +1.4 mU kg(-1) min(-1)) and moderate-intensity (+0.26 mU kg(-1) min(-1); 95% CI: -1.3, +1.8 mU kg(-1) min(-1)) ET arms compared with controls (interaction, P=0.97). Similarly, hepatic triglyceride at follow-up was not different in high-intensity (-1.7% fat/water (F/W); 95% CI: -7.0, +3.6% F/W) and moderate-intensity (-0.40% FW; 95% CI: -6.0, +5.3% F/W) ET compared with controls. Both high intensity (+4.4 ml per kg-FFM (fat-free mass) per minute; 95% CI: 1.7, 7.1 ml kg-FFM(-1) min(-1)) and moderate intensity (+4.4 ml kg-FFM(-1) min(-1); 95% CI: 1.6, 7.3 ml kg-FFM(-1) min(-1)) increased cardiorespiratory fitness, relative to controls (interaction P<0.001).\n\nConclusions: ET improves cardiorespiratory fitness among obese adolescents; however, owing to lack of compliance, the influence of exercise intensity on insulin sensitivity and hepatic triglycerides remains unclear.",

This randomized clinical trial determined \nhow ceramic-on-ceramic (CERAMIC) bearing THA affected joint-specific pain, \nfunction, and stiffness and prosthesis fixation/longevity over 10 postoperative \nyears compared with ceramic-on-highly-crosslinked-polyethylene (POLYETHYLENE) \nbearing THA. This is a follow-up to previously reported 5-year outcomes.\nMETHODS: Subjects aged <61 years were randomized to CERAMIC (n = 48) or \nPOLYETHYLENE (n = 44) THA. The primary outcome was joint-specific pain, \nfunction, and stiffness assessed using the Western Ontario McMaster \nOsteoarthritis Index. Secondary outcomes included the RAND 12-Item Health Survey. \nSubjects were assessed preoperatively, and at 1, 5, and 10 years postoperatively. \nPlain radiographs were evaluated at 10 years for fixation, and medical records \nwere reviewed for revisions.\nRESULTS: Of 92 subjects, 6 (7%) died within 10 years; 68 (79%) survivors \nprovided radiographic and/or clinical follow-up at 10 years postoperatively. \nThere were no group differences in the Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis \nIndex at 10 years (P > .48). There were no group differences in the RAND 12-Item \nHealth Survey at 10 years (P > .48). There were no failures or loss of fixation \nrelated to bearing surfaces/wear in either group. Over 10 years, 3 subjects in \nthe POLYETHYLENE group had revisions that were related to recurrent dislocation; \n2 revisions were performed within 2 years of surgery, and one further subject \nunderwent revision at 7 years postoperatively.\nCONCLUSIONS: CERAMIC bearing THA was not more effective than POLYETHYLENE \nbearing THA in patients aged <61 years undergoing total hip arthroplasty.",

However, \nduring the needling process, a cuff defect is created. Little is known about the \nevolution of this defect.\nMETHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial to \ninvestigate the evolution of the aforementioned defect and the role of \nplatelet-rich plasma (PRP) augmentation in this healing process. Patients were \nrandomized to either group 1 (PRP, n\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u203020) or group 2 (no PRP [control group], \nn\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u203020). Patients in group 1 received a perioperative PRP infiltration at the \nrotator cuff defect, whereas the control group did not. Patients were assessed \nclinically preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and 1 \nyear. The Constant score, Simple Shoulder Test, and QuickDASH (short version of \nDisabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire) were used as outcome \nmeasures. The evolution of the cuff defect was evaluated on sonography at 3 and \n6 months and with magnetic resonance imaging after 1 year.\nRESULTS: All patients improved significantly after surgery (P\u0432\u0402\u2030<\u0432\u0402\u2030.05). There was \nno difference in clinical outcome or rotator cuff healing between groups. We \nobserved a high rate of persistent rotator cuff defects after 1 year in both \ngroups. The presence of residual cuff defects did not influence the clinical \noutcome.\nCONCLUSION: Arthroscopic needling is an operation with a predictive, good \nclinical outcome. We found a high rate of persistent rotator cuff defects after \n1 year. This study could not identify any beneficial effect of the addition of \nPRP on rotator cuff healing.",

The aim of this study is to investigate the \neffectiveness of SRS reapplication after draping to reduce the incidence of SSI \nafter TJA.\nMETHODS: Six hundred patients undergoing primary TJA between 2010 and 2011 at a \nsingle institution were recruited and randomly assigned to one of 2 groups. The \npatients in the intervention group (n\u0412\u00a0= 300) received SPS that included alcohol \nand povidone-iodine before draping and an additional SPS by iodine povacrylex \nand isopropyl alcohol before application of the final adhesive drape, whereas \nthe patients in the control group (n\u0412\u00a0= 300) received a single SPS with alcohol \nand povidone-iodine before draping. Randomization was performed by an opaque \nenvelope, and the rates of SSI and blistering were compared between groups.\nRESULTS: Five seventy-seven patients completed the study and were included in \nthe final analysis. There was a significant reduction in the incidence of \nsuperficial SSI for the intervention group (1.8%, 5 of 283) compared to the \ncontrol group (6.5%, 19 of 294, P\u0412\u00a0= .02). There were 2 (0.7%, 2 of 294) deep \nincisional SSIs in the control group, and 2 (0.7%, 2 of 283) organ-space SSIs in \nthe intervention group (P\u0412\u00a0= 1.00). In addition, skin blistering was lower in the \nintervention group (3.5%, 10 of 283) vs the control group (6.5%, 19 of 294), but \nthis difference also did not reach statistical significance (P\u0412\u00a0= .13).\nCONCLUSION: Reapplication of an SPS after draping and before the application of \niodophor-impregnated incisive draping resulted in a significant reduction in the \nrate of SSI in patients undergoing elective TJA.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preventing surgical site infection (SSI) after total joint \narthroplasty (TJA) is a high priority and is partly linked to the efficacy of \nsurgical site preparation solutions (SPSs) in reducing the number of pathogens \non the skin before incision. The aim of this study is to investigate the \neffectiveness of SPS reapplication after draping to reduce the incidence of SSI \nafter TJA.\nMETHODS: Six hundred patients undergoing primary TJA between 2010 and 2011 at a \nsingle institution were recruited and randomly assigned to one of 2 groups. The \npatients in the intervention group (n = 300) received SPS that included alcohol \nand povidone-iodine before draping and an additional SPS by iodine povacrylex \nand isopropyl alcohol before application of the final adhesive drape, whereas \nthe patients in the control group (n = 300) received a single SPS with alcohol \nand povidone-iodine before draping. Randomization was performed by an opaque \nenvelope, and the rates of SSI and blistering were compared between groups. The \nprimary outcome was overall SSI rate.\nRESULTS: Five seventy-seven patients completed the study and were included in \nthe final analysis. Overall SSI occurred in 9 of 283 patients (3.2%) in the \nintervention group compared to 21 of 294 patients (7.1%) in the control group \n(P = .06). Superficial SSI occurred in 5 of 283 patients (1.8%) in the \nintervention group compared to 19 of 294 patients (6.5%) in the control group \n(P = .02). There were 2 (0.7%) deep incisional SSIs in the control group, and 2 \n(0.7%) organ-space SSIs in the intervention group (P = 1.00). Skin blistering \noccurred in 10 of 283 patients (3.5%) in the intervention group versus 19 of 294 \npatients (6.5%) in the control group (P = .13).\nCONCLUSION: The SPS reapplication was not more effective than single SPS \napplication in reducing overall SSI in patients undergoing elective TJA.",

After 2 years of follow-up, 12 men and 13 women (mean age, 61.8 years; \nrange, 52-67 years) in the SR group and 15 men and 10 women (mean age, 58.9 \nyears; range, 51-69 years) in the DR group were evaluated. To assess the retear \nrate, magnetic resonance imaging of the shoulder was performed at 2-year \nfollow-up. The clinical evaluation was based on the modified University of \nCalifornia, Los Angeles (UCLA) shoulder score and range of motion (ROM) \nmeasurements.\nRESULTS: Magnetic resonance arthrography showed a significantly lower \nfull-thickness retear rate for the DR group than for the SR group (8% vs 24%, \nrespectively; P < .05). At both 6-month and 2-year follow-up, there \nwas no statistically significant difference in terms of the rate of stiffness in \nthe SR and DR groups (8% vs 12% and 0% vs 0%, respectively; P > .05). No \nclinical differences were recorded regarding the UCLA score (SR group: mean, \n32.6 [range, 30-35]; DR group: mean, 33.3 [range, 29-35]; P = .61) and ROM.\nCONCLUSION: DR repair was not more effective than SR repair on clinical outcomes in patients undergoing early accelerated mobilization after rotator cuff repair.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recently, an accelerated rehabilitation protocol after rotator cuff \n(RC) repair has been proposed for patients at risk of postoperative stiffness.\nPURPOSE: To investigate, in patients undergoing early accelerated mobilization, \nwhether double-row (DR) repair provides better clinical outcomes and a lower \nretear rate compared with single-row (SR) configurations.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\nMETHODS: A total of 58 patients were randomized to undergo either SR or DR \nrepair. After 2 years of follow-up, 12 men and 13 women (mean age, 61.8 years; \nrange, 52-67 years) in the SR group and 15 men and 10 women (mean age, 58.9 \nyears; range, 51-69 years) in the DR group were evaluated. To assess the retear \nrate, magnetic resonance imaging of the shoulder was performed at 2-year \nfollow-up. The clinical evaluation was based on the modified University of \nCalifornia, Los Angeles (UCLA) shoulder score and range of motion (ROM) \nmeasurements.\nRESULTS: Magnetic resonance arthrography showed a significantly lower \nfull-thickness retear rate for the DR group than for the SR group (8% vs 24%, \nrespectively; P < .05). Conversely, at both 6-month and 2-year follow-up, there \nwas no statistically significant difference in terms of the rate of stiffness in \nthe SR and DR groups (8% vs 12% and 0% vs 0%, respectively; P > .05). No \nclinical differences were recorded regarding the UCLA score (SR group: mean, \n32.6 [range, 30-35]; DR group: mean, 33.3 [range, 29-35]; P = .61) and ROM.\nCONCLUSION: In selected patients at a high risk of shoulder stiffness and \ntherefore necessitating accelerated postoperative rehabilitation, DR repair of \nthe RC could lower retear rates.",

This prospective \nrandomized study comparing navigation-assisted TKA and conventional TKA reported \nthe clinical and radiological outcomes at a follow-up of 9\u0412\u00a0years. The purpose of \nthis study was to compare the clinical and radiological outcomes for patients \nwho underwent navigation-assisted TKA or conventional TKA after long-term \nfollow-up.\nMETHODS: A total of 80 patients (88 knees) were available for physical and \nradiological examination 9\u0412\u00a0years after TKA. Clinical outcomes were evaluated \nusing HSS, WOMAC, and KS function and pain scores. And radiological outcomes of \nthe component loosening and its survivorship during 9-year follow-up were also \nevaluated.\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences in the field of clinical outcomes \nbetween the two groups. In terms of radiological outcomes, the navigation group \nhad fewer alignment outliers (7.3 vs 20\u0412\u00a0%, p\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a00.006). Although the clinical \noutcomes showed no differences between the two groups, the survival rate was \nslightly better in the navigation group than in the conventional group without \nstatistical significance (best-case scenario 100 vs 95.3\u0412\u00a0%, n.s., worst-case \nscenario 95.6 vs 88.4\u0412\u00a0%, n.s.).\nCONCLUSION: Navigation-assisted TKA produced better alignment outcomes and \nbetter survival rates than conventional instruments although some of the \ndifferences were not statistically significant.",

It delays mobilization, increases opioid consumption and side effects, and lengthens hospitalization. This challenge multiplies when treating an opioid-dependent population. We examined whether a novel suspended release local anesthetic, liposomal bupivacaine (LB) would improve pain control and decrease opioid consumption after TKA compared to a standard periarticular injection in opioid-dependent patients.\n\nMethods: Thirty-eight patients undergoing TKA were randomly assigned to receive either a periarticular injection (PAI) with LB (n = 20) or with a standard PAI (including a combination of ropivacaine, clonidine, Toradol, Epinepherine, and saline; n = 18) as part of a multimodal pain management approach. All periarticular injections were done by a single surgeon. Perioperative treatment was similar between groups. Postoperative information regarding pain level was evaluated by a pain visual analog scale score. Postoperative opioid consumption was recorded.\n\nResults: After controlling baseline narcotic usage before surgery, no differences were found between groups in daily postoperative narcotic usage (P = .113), average daily pain score (P = .332), or maximum daily pain score (P = .881). However, when examining pain levels separately for each day, pain visual analog scale scores were reported higher in post operative day 1 in the LB group (P = .033).\n\nConclusions: LB was not found to be superior to standard PAI in opioid-dependent patients undergoing TKA.

Owing to this characteristic, separate repair of \ndelaminated rotator cuff tears has been introduced for the restoration of the \nphysiological biomechanics of the rotator cuff. However, whether conventional en \nmasse repair or separate repair is superior is controversial in terms of \noutcomes.\nPURPOSE: To compare clinical outcomes between conventional en masse repair and \nseparate double-layer double-row repair for the treatment of delaminated rotator \ncuff tears.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled study; Level of evidence, 2.\nMETHODS: Between August 2007 and March 2014, a total of 82 patients who \nunderwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of a delaminated tear were enrolled \nand randomized into 2 groups. In group 1 (n = 48), arthroscopic conventional en \nmasse repair was performed. In group 2 (n = 34), separate double-layer \ndouble-row repair was performed. The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, \nConstant score, Simple Shoulder Test score, visual analog scale (VAS) score \nfor pain, and range of motion (ROM) were assessed before surgery; at 3, 6, and 12 \nmonths after surgery; and at the last follow-up visit. Magnetic resonance \nimaging (MRI) was performed at 12 months postoperatively to examine the retear \nrate and pattern.\nRESULTS: There was no significant difference between groups in the preoperative \ndemographic data, including patient age, sex, symptom duration, tear size, and \nfunctional scores (P > .05). The mean follow-up period was 25.9 \u00b1 1.2 months. \nNo significant differences in functional scores and ROM were found between the 2 \ngroups at each time point. Group 2 had significantly lower VAS pain scores (P < \n.05) at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Eight (17%) of 48 patients in group \n1 and 6 (18%) of 34 patients in group 2 showed retears on MRI at 12-month \nfollow-up (P > .05).\nCONCLUSION: Separate double-layer double-row repair was not more effective than \nconventional en masse repair in patients with delaminated rotator cuff tears.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The rotator cuff tendon is known to exert a shear force between the \nsuperficial and deep layers. Owing to this characteristic, separate repair of \ndelaminated rotator cuff tears has been introduced for the restoration of the \nphysiological biomechanics of the rotator cuff. However, whether conventional en \nmasse repair or separate repair is superior is controversial in terms of \noutcomes.\nPURPOSE: To compare clinical outcomes between conventional en masse repair and \nseparate double-layer double-row repair for the treatment of delaminated rotator \ncuff tears.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled study; Level of evidence, 2.\nMETHODS: Between August 2007 and March 2014, a total of 82 patients who \nunderwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of a delaminated tear were enrolled \nand randomized into 2 groups. In group 1 (n = 48), arthroscopic conventional en \nmasse repair was performed. In group 2 (n = 34), separate double-layer \ndouble-row repair was performed. The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, \nConstant score, Simple Shoulder Test score, and visual analog scale (VAS) score \nfor pain and range of motion (ROM) were assessed before surgery; at 3, 6, and 12 \nmonths after surgery; and at the last follow-up visit. Magnetic resonance \nimaging (MRI) was performed at 12 months postoperatively to examine the retear \nrate and pattern.\nRESULTS: There was no significant difference between groups in the preoperative \ndemographic data, including patient age, sex, symptom duration, tear size, and \nfunctional scores (P > .05). The mean follow-up period was 25.9 \u0412\u00b1 1.2 months. \nSignificant improvements in functional and pain scores were observed in both \ngroups at the last follow-up visit. However, no significant differences in \nfunctional scores and ROM were found between the 2 groups at each time point, \nexcept that group 2 had significantly lower VAS pain scores (P < .05) at 3, 6, \nand 12 months postoperatively. Eight (17%) of 48 patients in group 1 and 6 (18%) \nof 34 patients in group 2 showed retears on MRI at 12-month follow-up (P > .05).\nCONCLUSION: Both conventional en masse repair and separate double-layer \ndouble-row repair were effective in improving clinical outcomes in the treatment \nof delaminated rotator cuff tears. Lower pain scores were seen in patients who \nunderwent separate double-layer double-row repair.",

Patients \nwith isolated subscapularis tears or osteoarthritis were excluded. Finally, 86 \npatients (Deb in 28, BTo in 27, and BTd in 31) were analyzed (mean follow-up, \n22.1 \u00b1 7.72 months; mean age, 58.98 \u00b1 7.8 years). Pain; functional, clinical, \nand radiologic outcomes; and the strength index of elbow flexion and forearm \nsupination were analyzed.\nRESULTS: Pain, range of motion, and functional scores improved postoperatively \nin all 3 groups, with no significant differences across groups. At the 6-month \nfollow-up, 8 patients reported cramping pain (5 Deb patients, 2 BTo patients, \nand 1 BTd patient), but the pain improved in most patients over time (with \ncramping pain reported by zero Deb patients, 1 BTo patient, and 1 BTd patient at \nfinal follow-up). Bicipital groove tenderness improved in the BTo group \npostoperatively (P = .006). The Popeye deformity was noted in 10 patients \n(37.0%) in the BTo group, 8 (25.8%) in the BTd group, and 2 (7.1%) in the Deb \ngroup (P = .029). On radiologic examination, the presence of tenodesis of the \nbiceps tendons on the bicipital groove showed low agreement with the presence of \nthe Popeye deformity (observed in 13 of 20 patients with the deformity, 65%). \nOn strength index analysis, the BTo group showed lower forearm supination \nstrength (0.877 \u00b1 0.44) compared with that in the other groups (1.29 \u00b1 0.525 in \nthe Deb group and 1.12 \u00b1 0.451 in the BTd group, P = .049).\nCONCLUSIONS: Simple debridement was not more effective than biceps tenotomy or \nbiceps tenodesis in patients with concomitant superior labrum-biceps complex \nlesions and rotator cuff tears.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To compare the clinical outcomes in patients with concomitant superior \nlabrum-biceps complex (SLBC) lesions and rotator cuff tears who underwent \narthroscopic rotator cuff repair, according to 3 different treatment methods \n(simple debridement, biceps tenotomy, or biceps tenodesis) for the SLBC lesions.\nMETHODS: One hundred twenty patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff \nrepair with SLBC lesions (biceps partial tears <50%, partial pulley lesions, and \ntype II SLAP lesions) were enrolled in this prospective comparative study and \nrandomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups (simple debridement [Deb], biceps \ntenotomy only [BTo], or biceps tenodesis with one suture anchor [BTd]). Patients \nwith isolated subscapularis tears or osteoarthritis were excluded. Finally, 86 \npatients (Deb in 28, BTo in 27, and BTd in 31) were analyzed (mean follow-up, \n22.1 \u0412\u00b1 7.72 months; mean age, 58.98 \u0412\u00b1 7.8 years). Pain; functional, clinical, \nand radiologic outcomes; and the strength index of elbow flexion and forearm \nsupination were analyzed.\nRESULTS: Pain, range of motion, and functional scores significantly improved \npostoperatively in all 3 groups, with no significant differences across groups. \nAt the 6-month follow-up, 8 patients reported cramping pain (5 Deb patients, 2 \nBTo patients, and 1 BTd patient), but the pain improved in most patients over \ntime (with cramping pain reported by zero Deb patients, 1 BTo patient, and 1 BTd \npatient at final follow-up). Bicipital groove tenderness significantly improved \nin the BTo group postoperatively (P\u0412\u00a0= .006). The Popeye deformity was noted in \n10 patients (37.0%) in the BTo group, 8 (25.8%) in the BTd group, and only 2 \n(7.1%) in the Deb group (P\u0412\u00a0= .029). On radiologic examination, the presence of \ntenodesis of the biceps tendons on the bicipital groove showed low agreement \nwith the presence of the Popeye deformity (observed in 13 of 20 patients with \nthe deformity, 65%). On strength index analysis, the BTo group showed lower \nforearm supination strength (0.877 \u0412\u00b1 0.44) compared with that in the other \ngroups (1.29 \u0412\u00b1 0.525 in the Deb group and 1.12 \u0412\u00b1 0.451 in the BTd group, P\u0412\u00a0= \n.049).\nCONCLUSIONS: All 3 treatments improved pain and function. Simple debridement \nshowed the lowest risk of the Popeye deformity and preserved forearm supination \nstrength. Biceps tenotomy and tenodesis may be preferable for selected patients: \nbiceps tenotomy for patients with definite bicipital groove tenderness and \nbiceps tenodesis for patients, especially male patients, with bicipital groove \ntenderness who want to preserve supination strength.",

The primary outcome was 18-month weight change.\n\nResults: Estimated effects comparing the mindfulness to control arm favored the mindfulness arm in (a) weight loss at 12 months, -1.9 kg (95% CI: -4.5, 0.8; P = 0.17), and 18 months, -1.7 kg (95% CI: -4.7, 1.2; P = 0.24), though not statistically significant; (b) changes in fasting glucose at 12 months, -3.1 mg/dl (95% CI: -6.3, 0.1; P = 0.06), and 18 months, -4.1 mg/dl (95% CI: -7.3, -0.9; P = 0.01); and (c) changes in triglyceride/HDL ratio at 12 months, -0.57 (95% CI: -0.95, -0.18; P = 0.004), and 18 months, -0.36 (95% CI: -0.74, 0.03; P = 0.07). Estimates for other metabolic risk factors were not statistically significant, including waist circumference, blood pressure, and C-reactive protein.\n\nConclusions: Mindfulness enhancements to a diet-exercise program did not show substantial weight loss benefit but may promote long-term improvement in some aspects of metabolic health in obesity that requires further study.",

We aimed to determine if \nthere is any difference in the early outcome of revision TKA when performed \nwith, or without SD.\nMETHODS: 83 cases indicated for revision knee arthroplasty were randomized to \nreceive (42) or not receive (41) a deep intra-articlular drain. First-stage \nrevisions for treating periprosthetic infection were excluded. Patients were \nstatistically compared for demographic parameters, early complications and early \nknee functional outcome. The assessed outcomes included total blood loss, number \nof transfusions, fever and wound complication rate at 24 months follow-up. In \naddition, the change in knee society score at 12 weeks postoperatively was \ncompared between the groups.\nRESULTS: There were no significant difference in demographic factors, wound \ncomplications, knee scores at 12 weeks and infection rate 24 months after \nsurgery in either group. Average blood loss was 1856ml and 1533ml for the drain \nand no drain groups, respectively (P value=0.0470). The need for transfusion was \nsignificantly less in the no-drain group with an average of 0.15 unit/patient as \ncompared to an average 0.37 unit/patient for the drain group (P value=0.0432).\nCONCLUSION: We were unable to find a point of superiority for using a drain for \nrevision knee arthroplasty. Future studies with longer follow-up and larger \npopulation of patients are needed to make a valid conclusion.",

Paramedics enrolled patients at 10 North American sites. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge; the secondary outcome was favorable neurologic function at discharge. The per-protocol (primary analysis) population included all randomly assigned participants who met eligibility criteria and received any dose of a trial drug and whose initial cardiac-arrest rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia was refractory to shock.\n\nResults: In the per-protocol population, 3026 patients were randomly assigned to amiodarone (974), lidocaine (993), or placebo (1059); of those, 24.4%, 23.7%, and 21.0%, respectively, survived to hospital discharge. The difference in survival rate for amiodarone versus placebo was 3.2 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.4 to 7.0; P=0.08); for lidocaine versus placebo, 2.6 percentage points (95% CI, -1.0 to 6.3; P=0.16); and for amiodarone versus lidocaine, 0.7 percentage points (95% CI, -3.2 to 4.7; P=0.70). Neurologic outcome at discharge was similar in the three groups. More amiodarone recipients required temporary cardiac pacing than did recipients of lidocaine or placebo.\n\nConclusions: Neither amiodarone nor lidocaine was more effective on survival to hospital discharge than placebo in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether there are middle-term differences in knee function and pain in patients undergoing fixed- and mobile-bearing total knee arthroplasty (TKA).\n\nMethods: Eligible patients were randomized into two groups: the first group received TKA implantation with a fixed tibial platform (group A); the second group received TKA with a mobile tibial platform (group B). Patients were followed up (2 years), and their symptoms and limitations in daily living activities were evaluated using the Knee Outcome Survey-Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADLS), in addition to pain evaluation assessed using the pain visual analogue scale (VAS).\n\nResults: There were no significant differences in function and symptoms in the ADLS and VAS between the study groups.\n\nConclusion: The type of platform used in TKA (fixed vs. mobile) does not change the symptoms, function or pain of patients 2 years post-surgery. Although mobile TKAs may have better short-term results, at medium- and long-term follow-up they do not present important clinical differences compared with fixed-platform TKAs. This information is important so that surgeons can choose the most suitable implant for each patient.",

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination of intravenous (IV) and topical tranexamic acid (TXA) in revision THA.\n\nMethods: Eighty-four consecutive patients undergoing revision THA were randomized into combined group and IV-TXA group. Patients in the combined group were given intravenously 15 mg/kg TXA as a preoperative, and topical TXA solution was applied at a concentration of 3 g TXA per 100-mL saline during the different procedure points. Patients in the IV-TXA group were given intravenously 15 mg/kg TXA alone.\n\nResults: The mean total blood loss, drainage volume, and maximum hemoglobin drop were significantly lower in the combined group than the IV-TXA group (P < .001, P < .001, P < .001, respectively). Compared with the IV-TXA group, the amount of blood transfusions and number of blood transfusions required were decreased dramatically in the combined group (P = .027, P < .001, respectively). One deep vein thrombosis and 4 calf muscular vein thrombosis in the combined group and 3 calf muscular vein thrombosis in the IV-TXA were detected by the Doppler ultrasound. No pulmonary embolism was observed and no significant differences were found in other complications between the 2 groups.\n\nConclusion: This study showed that combined administration of IV and topical TXA in revision THA can effectively decrease total blood loss and number of blood transfusions required without increasing the risk of deep vein thrombosis or/and pulmonary embolism compared with IV-TXA alone.",

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination of intravenous (IV) and topical tranexamic acid (TXA) in revision THA.\n\nMethods: Eighty-four consecutive patients undergoing revision THA were randomized into combined group and IV-TXA group. The primary outcome was total blood loss. Patients in the combined group were given intravenously 15 mg/kg TXA as a preoperative, and topical TXA solution was applied at a concentration of 3 g TXA per 100-mL saline during the different procedure points. Patients in the IV-TXA group were given intravenously 15 mg/kg TXA alone.\n\nResults: The mean total blood loss was 1,247 mL in the combined group and 1,689 mL in the IV-TXA group (P < .001). The drainage volume and maximum hemoglobin drop were lower in the combined group than the IV-TXA group (P < .001, P < .001, respectively). The amount of blood transfusions and number of blood transfusions required were lower in the combined group compared with the IV-TXA group (P = .027, P < .001, respectively). One deep vein thrombosis and 4 calf muscular vein thrombosis in the combined group and 3 calf muscular vein thrombosis in the IV-TXA were detected by the Doppler ultrasound. No pulmonary embolism was observed and no significant differences were found in other complications between the 2 groups.\n\nConclusion: Combined administration of IV and topical TXA was more effective than IV-TXA alone on total blood loss in patients undergoing revision THA.",

Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 1.5, \n3, 6, and 12 months after ACI and was evaluated by the magnetic resonance \nobservation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score and the Knee injury and \nOsteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS).\nRESULTS: MOCART scores showed improvements after 3 months, with slight dose \ndependence, and further improvement after 12 months, although without \nsignificant dose dependence. The mean MOCART scores after 3 months (0 = worst, \n100 = best) were 59.8, 64.5, and 64.7 for the low-, medium-, and high-dose \ngroups, respectively, and 62.9 for all patients; at 12 months, these were 74.1, \n74.5, and 68.8 for the respective dose groups and 72.4 for all patients. Several \nMOCART items (surface of repair tissue, structure of repair tissue, signal \nintensity of repair tissue, subchondral bone, and synovitis) showed a more rapid \nresponse with the medium and high doses than with the low dose, suggesting a \npotential dose relationship. No significant correlation between the MOCART \n(overall and subscores) with clinical outcomes as assessed by the overall KOOS \nwas detected at 3- and 12-month assessments.\nCONCLUSION: This study reveals a trend toward earlier recovery after treatment \nwith higher spheroid doses in terms of better defect filling for full-thickness \ncartilage defects of the knee, while outcomes after 12 months were similar in \nall dose groups. However, a correlation with clinical outcomes or the failure \nrate at 1 year after ACI was not found. A longer follow-up will be required for \nmore definite conclusions on the clinical relevance of ACI cell density to be \ndrawn.\nREGISTRATION: NCT01225575 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier); 2009-016816-20 \n(EudraCT number).",

        "abstract": "Background: Tenotomy and tenodesis are common treatments for lesions in the long head of biceps tendon (LHBT); however, which treatment is superior is still controversial. This study compared the outcomes of tenotomy with outcomes of tenodesis for treatment of LHBT lesions with rotator cuff tears.\n\nMethods: The study enrolled 128 patients with LHBT lesions and small- to medium-sized rotator cuff tear. Arthroscopic LHBT tenotomy was done in 56 patients (group I), and LHBT tenodesis was done for 72 patients (group II) with rotator cuff repair. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Score, simple shoulder test, pain visual analog scale, range of motion, and cosmetic changes were assessed initially, at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively, and the last visit. The elbow motor power and magnetic resonance imaging were evaluated at 12 months.\n\nResults: Both groups showed improvement in functional scores after treatments, but no significant difference was found between the 2 groups at each assessment. The rate of Popeye deformity was 3 times higher in group I (P = .04). Group II showed greater forearm supination power than group I (P = .02). On magnetic resonance imaging, 45 patients (80.4%) in group I showed maintenance of the LHBT cut end within the bicipital groove, whereas 65 patients (90.3%) in group II showed maintenance of fixated LHBT.\n\nConclusion: For the treatment of LHBT lesions with rotator cuff tear, patients with tenotomy and tenodesis both showed significant improvements in functional scores. The incidence of Popeye deformity was about 3-times higher in tenotomy group. No significant differences in elbow motor power were observed except greater forearm supination power in the tenodesis group.",

Nonsurgical \ntreatment included first a week of cast immobilization, followed by a functional \northosis for 6 weeks, allowing full weightbearing after week 1 and active \nplantar flexion after week 5. Surgery was simple end-to-end open repair, and \npostoperative treatment was identical to nonsurgical treatment. The primary outcome \nwas the Leppilahti Achilles tendon performance score. Secondary outcomes included \nisokinetic calf muscle strength and RAND 36-Item Health Survey at 18-month follow-up.\nRESULTS: At 18-month follow-up, the mean Leppilahti score was 79.5 and 75.7 for \nthe surgically and nonsurgically treated groups, respectively (mean difference, \n3.8; 95% CI, -1.9 to 9.5; P = .19). Angle-specific peak torque results of \naffected legs at 18 months showed a 14% difference in the peak torque of the \naffected leg favoring the surgical group versus the nonsurgical group (mean peak \ntorque, 110.3 vs 96.5 N\u00b7m, respectively; mean difference, 13.6 N\u00b7m; 95% CI, \n2.0-25.1 N\u00b7m; P = .022). The RAND 36-Item Health Survey indicated differences \nin the domains of physical functioning (P = .006) and bodily pain (P = .037) \nfor surgically treated patients.\nCONCLUSION: Surgical treatment was not more effective than nonsurgical treatment \non the Leppilahti Achilles tendon performance score in patients with acute \nAchilles tendon ruptures.\nREGISTRATION: NCT02012803 (ClinicalTrials.gov).",

In a randomized trial, we tested whether shortening these pauses \nimproves survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).\nMETHODS: Patients with OHCA between May 2006 and January 2014 with shockable \ninitial rhythm, treated by first responders, were randomized to two automated \nexternal defibrillator (AED) treatment protocols. In the control protocol AEDs \nperformed post-shock analysis and prompted rescuers to a pulse check (Guidelines \n2000). In the experimental protocol a 15s period of CPR during and after \ncharging of the AED was added to the voice prompts and CPR was resumed \nimmediately after defibrillation (modification of the Guidelines 2005). Survival \nwas assessed at hospital admission and discharge.\nRESULTS: Of 1174 OHCA patients, 456 met the inclusion criteria: 227 were \nrandomly assigned to the experimental protocol and 229 to the control protocol. \nThe experimental group experienced shorter pre-shock pauses (6 [5-11]s vs. 20 \n[18-23]s; P<0.001), and shorter post-shock pauses (7 [6-9]s vs. 27 [16-34]s; \nP<0.001). Similar proportions of patients survived to hospital admission \n(experimental: 62% vs.\nCONTROL: 65%; RR [95%CI] 0.96 [0.83-1.10], P=0.51), and hospital discharge \n(experimental: 42% vs.\nCONTROL: 38%; RR [95%CI] 1.09 [0.87-1.37], P=0.46).\nCONCLUSION: In patients with OHCA and shockable initial rhythms, treatment with \nAEDs with the experimental protocol shortened pre-shock and post-shock CPR \npauses, and increased overall CPR time, but did not improve survival to hospital \nadmission or discharge.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous large retrospective analyses have found an association \nbetween duration of peri-shock pauses in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and \nsurvival. In a randomized trial, we tested whether shortening these pauses \nimproves survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).\nMETHODS: Patients with OHCA between May 2006 and January 2014 with shockable \ninitial rhythm, treated by first responders, were randomized to two automated \nexternal defibrillator (AED) treatment protocols. In the control protocol AEDs \nperformed post-shock analysis and prompted rescuers to a pulse check (Guidelines \n2000). In the experimental protocol a 15s period of CPR during and after \ncharging of the AED was added to the voice prompts and CPR was resumed \nimmediately after defibrillation (modification of the Guidelines 2005). The primary outcome was survival to hospital admission. Secondary outcome was survival to hospital discharge.\nRESULTS: Of 1174 OHCA patients, 456 met the inclusion criteria: 227 were \nrandomly assigned to the experimental protocol and 229 to the control protocol. \nSimilar proportions of patients survived to hospital admission \n(experimental: 62% vs.\nCONTROL: 65%; RR [95%CI] 0.96 [0.83-1.10], P=0.51), and hospital discharge \n(experimental: 42% vs.\nCONTROL: 38%; RR [95%CI] 1.09 [0.87-1.37], P=0.46).\nCONCLUSION: The experimental protocol was not more effective on survival to hospital admission than the control protocol in patients with OHCA and shockable initial rhythms.",

        "abstract": "Background: Opioid analgesics have been a standard modality for postoperative pain management after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) but are also associated with increased risk of nausea, pruritus, vomiting, respiratory depression, prolonged ileus, and cognitive dysfunction. There is still a need for a method of anesthesia that can deliver effective long-term postoperative pain relief without incurring the high cost and health burden of opioids and nerve blocks.\n\nQuestions/purposes: (1) Is liposomal bupivacaine-based periarticular injection (PAI) more effective than morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA? (2) Do patients treated with liposomal bupivacaine-based PAI experience fewer opioid-related adverse events compared with patients treated with morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA?\n\nMethods: This multicenter, blind trial randomized 119 patients undergoing TKA with spinal anesthesia to receive spinal anesthesia plus periarticular injection with liposomal bupivacaine (40 patients), spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine plus intrathecal morphine (41 patients) but no liposomal bupivacaine injection, or spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine (38 patients) and no liposomal bupivacaine injection. The two groups that did not receive periarticular liposomal bupivacaine did receive periarticular injection with ropivacaine, and all three groups had ketorolac (30 mg) plus epinephrine (1:1000) in the periarticular injections. Patients in all three groups received identical perioperative multimodal analgesic and antiemetic drugs. All patients were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized and no patients were lost to followup. The primary study endpoints were visual analog score (VAS) for pain and narcotic use during postoperative day 1. Secondary endpoints included side effects associated with narcotic administration during the hospital stay.\n\nResults: Mean VAS pain in the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group was lower than that for the ropivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (1.8 \u00b1 2.1 versus 3.3 \u00b1 2.3, p = 0.005, mean difference: 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-2.5) and 12 hours (1.5 \u00b1 2.0 versus 3.3 \u00b1 2.4, p < 0.001, mean difference: 1.8, 95% CI, 0.8-2.8) after surgery. The morphine spinal group had lower pain compared with the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (0.9 \u00b1 1.8 versus 1.8 \u00b1 2.1, p = 0.035, mean difference: 1.0, 95% CI, 0.1-1.8), but there was no difference at 12 hours (0.8 \u00b1 1.5 versus 1.5 \u00b1 2.0, p = 0.086, mean difference: 0.7, 95% CI, -0.1 to 1.5). The magnitude of the differences at 6 and 12 hours are near the lower end of minimal clinically important differences reported in the literature, and thus the improvement shown in this study may only represent a small clinical improvement. Both the liposomal bupivacaine group (13% [five of 40]) and the ropivacaine group (5% [two of 38]) had fewer incidents of itching (pruritus) than the spinal morphine group (38% [15 of 41]) (p = 0.001).\n\nConclusions: Liposomal bupivacaine-based periarticular injection was not more effective than morphine-based spinal anesthesia on visual analog score for pain and narcotic use during postoperative day 1 in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.",

        "abstract": "Background: Opioid analgesics have been a standard modality for postoperative pain management after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) but are also associated with increased risk of nausea, pruritus, vomiting, respiratory depression, prolonged ileus, and cognitive dysfunction. There is still a need for a method of anesthesia that can deliver effective long-term postoperative pain relief without incurring the high cost and health burden of opioids and nerve blocks.\n\nQuestions/purposes: (1) Is liposomal bupivacaine-based periarticular injection (PAI) more effective than morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA? (2) Do patients treated with liposomal bupivacaine-based PAI experience fewer opioid-related adverse events compared with patients treated with morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA?\n\nMethods: This multicenter, blind trial randomized 119 patients undergoing TKA with spinal anesthesia to receive spinal anesthesia plus periarticular injection with liposomal bupivacaine (40 patients), spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine plus intrathecal morphine (41 patients) but no liposomal bupivacaine injection, or spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine (38 patients) and no liposomal bupivacaine injection. The two groups that did not receive periarticular liposomal bupivacaine did receive periarticular injection with ropivacaine, and all three groups had ketorolac (30 mg) plus epinephrine (1:1000) in the periarticular injections. Patients in all three groups received identical perioperative multimodal analgesic and antiemetic drugs. All patients were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized and no patients were lost to followup. The primary study endpoints were visual analog score (VAS) for pain and narcotic use during postoperative day 1. Secondary endpoints included side effects associated with narcotic administration during the hospital stay.\n\nResults: Mean VAS pain in the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group was lower than that for the ropivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (1.8 \u00b1 2.1 versus 3.3 \u00b1 2.3, p = 0.005, mean difference: 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-2.5) and 12 hours (1.5 \u00b1 2.0 versus 3.3 \u00b1 2.4, p < 0.001, mean difference: 1.8, 95% CI, 0.8-2.8) after surgery. The morphine spinal group had lower pain compared with the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (0.9 \u00b1 1.8 versus 1.8 \u00b1 2.1, p = 0.035, mean difference: 1.0, 95% CI, 0.1-1.8), but there was no difference at 12 hours (0.8 \u00b1 1.5 versus 1.5 \u00b1 2.0, p = 0.086, mean difference: 0.7, 95% CI, -0.1 to 1.5). The magnitude of the differences at 6 and 12 hours are near the lower end of minimal clinically important differences reported in the literature, and thus the improvement shown in this study may only represent a small clinical improvement. Both the liposomal bupivacaine group (13% [five of 40]) and the ropivacaine group (5% [two of 38]) had fewer incidents of itching (pruritus) than the spinal morphine group (38% [15 of 41]) (p = 0.001).\n\nConclusions: This prospective multicenter three-arm blind randomized controlled trial showed potentially improved pain control at 6 and 12 hours in the liposomal bupivacaine and intrathecal morphine groups compared with the ropivacaine group at the cost of much higher incidences of pruritus (itching) in the intrathecal morphine group. Based on these results, we prefer the use of PAI with liposomal bupivacaine as an alternative to spinal anesthesia with intrathecal morphine as a result of similar postoperative pain control and the potential for reducing adverse events.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Most studies on grafts for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) \nreconstruction (ACLR) have been of autografts or nonirradiated allografts with a \nsingle-bundle (SB) technique. Outcome reports evaluating anatomic double-bundle \n(DB) ACLR with a hamstring tendon autograft versus irradiated allograft are \nrare.\nPURPOSE: To compare the clinical outcomes of arthroscopic anatomic DB ACLR with \na hamstring tendon autograft versus irradiated allograft.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.\nMETHODS: Between 2008 and 2009, a total of 107 patients undergoing arthroscopic \nDB ACLR were prospectively randomized consecutively into 1 of 2 groups \n(autograft [Auto] group and irradiated allograft [Ir-Allo] group). All the \nsurgical procedures were performed by the same senior surgeon using the DB \nreconstruction technique. All irradiated hamstring tendon allografts were \nsterilized with 2.5 Mrad of irradiation before distribution and were obtained \nfrom a single certified tissue bank. Graft fixation on the femoral side was by \nan Endobutton, and on the tibial side by a bioabsorbable interference screw \naugmented with a staple. The same rehabilitation protocol was applied to all \npatients. Before surgery and at a mean of 6.9 years of follow-up, patients were \nevaluated by the same observer according to objective and subjective clinical \nevaluations including detailed history, physical examination, radiography, \nfunctional knee ligament testing, KT-2000 arthrometer testing, Harner vertical \njump and Daniel 1-legged hop tests, Lysholm score, Tegner score, International \nKnee Documentation Committee (IKDC) standard evaluation form, and Cincinnati \nknee score.\nRESULTS: A total of 83 patients (Auto: n = 40 [mean age, 29.2 \u00b1 6.9 years]; \nIr-Allo: n = 43 [mean age, 28.6 \u00b1 7.2 years]) fulfilled follow-up and clinical \nevaluations. No significant differences were found between the 2 groups \naccording to the overall IKDC functional and subjective evaluations as well as \ntesting of activity levels. Differences were found when comparing the results at \nfinal follow-up according to the Lachman test, anterior drawer test, pivot-shift \ntest, and KT-2000 arthrometer measurements (P < .001). 87.5% of patients in the \nAuto group and 34.9% in the Ir-Allo group had a side-to-side difference <3 mm. \nThe rate of laxity (side-to-side difference >5 mm) with an irradiated allograft \n(30.2%) was higher than that with an autograft (7.5%) (P < .001). The failure \nrate in the Ir-Allo group (30.2%) was higher than that in the Auto group (7.5%) \n(P < .001). Anterior and rotational stability decreased in the Ir-Allo group; \npatients in the Ir-Allo group also had a shorter operation time. There were \n10.0% (4/40) of patients in the Auto group and 32.6% (19/43) of patients in the \nIr-Allo group who had arthritic progression (P < .05).\nCONCLUSION: Hamstring tendon autograft was not more effective than irradiated \nallograft on overall IKDC functional and subjective evaluations in patients \nundergoing arthroscopic anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament \nreconstruction.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Most studies on grafts for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) \nreconstruction (ACLR) have been of autografts or nonirradiated allografts with a \nsingle-bundle (SB) technique. Outcome reports evaluating anatomic double-bundle \n(DB) ACLR with a hamstring tendon autograft versus irradiated allograft are \nrare.\nPURPOSE: To compare the clinical outcomes of arthroscopic anatomic DB ACLR with \na hamstring tendon autograft versus irradiated allograft.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.\nMETHODS: Between 2008 and 2009, a total of 107 patients undergoing arthroscopic \nDB ACLR were prospectively randomized consecutively into 1 of 2 groups \n(autograft [Auto] group and irradiated allograft [Ir-Allo] group). All the \nsurgical procedures were performed by the same senior surgeon using the DB \nreconstruction technique. All irradiated hamstring tendon allografts were \nsterilized with 2.5 Mrad of irradiation before distribution and were obtained \nfrom a single certified tissue bank. Graft fixation on the femoral side was by \nan Endobutton, and on the tibial side by a bioabsorbable interference screw \naugmented with a staple. The same rehabilitation protocol was applied to all \npatients. Before surgery and at a mean of 6.9 years of follow-up, patients were \nevaluated by the same observer according to objective and subjective clinical \nevaluations including detailed history, physical examination, radiography, \nfunctional knee ligament testing, KT-2000 arthrometer testing, Harner vertical \njump and Daniel 1-legged hop tests, Lysholm score, Tegner score, International \nKnee Documentation Committee (IKDC) standard evaluation form, and Cincinnati \nknee score.\nRESULTS: A total of 83 patients (Auto: n = 40 [mean age, 29.2 \u0412\u00b1 6.9 years]; \nIr-Allo: n = 43 [mean age, 28.6 \u0412\u00b1 7.2 years]) fulfilled follow-up and clinical \nevaluations. No significant differences were found between the 2 groups \naccording to the overall IKDC functional and subjective evaluations as well as \ntesting of activity levels. Significant between-group differences were found \nwhen comparing the results at final follow-up according to the Lachman test, \nanterior drawer test, pivot-shift test, and KT-2000 arthrometer measurements (P \n< .001). Most importantly, 87.5% of patients in the Auto group and 34.9% in the \nIr-Allo group had a side-to-side difference <3 mm. The rate of laxity \n(side-to-side difference >5 mm) with an irradiated allograft (30.2%) was higher \nthan that with an autograft (7.5%) (P < .001). The failure rate in the Ir-Allo \ngroup (30.2%) was higher than that in the Auto group (7.5%) (P < .001). Anterior \nand rotational stability decreased significantly in the Ir-Allo group; patients \nin the Ir-Allo group also had a shorter operation time. There were 10.0% (4/40) \nof patients in the Auto group and 32.6% (19/43) of patients in the Ir-Allo group \nwho had arthritic progression (P < .05).\nCONCLUSION: There were no significant differences in postoperative activity \nlevels and functional outcomes between the Auto and Ir-Allo groups. However, a \nsignificant increase in anterior and rotational laxity in the Ir-Allo group was \nfound according to evaluations. We do not advocate an irradiated hamstring \ntendon allograft for DB ACLR.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The management of the postoperative period after knee arthroscopic \nsurgery may be challenging because surgical trauma deeply alters the joint \nmicroenvironment, causing the release of several catabolic molecules and \nproinflammatory factors that might slow down functional recovery. The \npossibility of using hyaluronic acid (HA) to promote postoperative pain relief \nand expedite functional improvement seems attractive, considering its biological \nproperties.\nPURPOSE: The aim of the present double-blind randomized controlled trial was to \nevaluate the effects, in terms of pain control and functional recovery, provided \nby a single HA injection performed at the end of arthroscopic meniscectomy.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\nMETHODS: A total of 90 patients, 18 to 55 years old, were included according to \nthe following criteria: (1) chronic, symptomatic meniscal tears requiring \npartial resection; (2) a healthy contralateral knee; (3) no previous surgery on \nthe index knee; and (4) no other concurrent articular lesions requiring surgical \ntreatment (eg, cartilage or ligament injuries). Patients were randomized into 2 \ntreatment groups: one underwent meniscectomy alone, whereas the other also \nreceived an injection of 3 mL HA at the end of the procedure. The primary \noutcomes were pain control and functional recovery. All patients were \nevaluated at baseline and then at 15, 30, 60, and 180 days using the following \ntools: International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective, Knee injury \nand Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, VAS \nfor general health status, and Tegner scores. The transpatellar circumference \nand active and passive ranges of motion were also recorded during the follow-up \nevaluations.\nRESULTS: No major adverse events were reported using HA postoperatively. No \nsignificant intergroup difference was documented at any follow-up evaluation for \nany of the clinical scores. No difference was observed in the objective \nmeasurements. The mean time to return to full sports activity was not different \nbetween groups, and a comparable satisfaction rate was recorded in both \ntreatment groups.\nCONCLUSION: Hyaluronic acid was not more effective than meniscectomy alone for \npain control and functional recovery in patients undergoing arthroscopic \nmeniscectomy.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The management of the postoperative period after knee arthroscopic \nsurgery may be challenging because surgical trauma deeply alters the joint \nmicroenvironment, causing the release of several catabolic molecules and \nproinflammatory factors that might slow down functional recovery. The \npossibility of using hyaluronic acid (HA) to promote postoperative pain relief \nand expedite functional improvement seems attractive, considering its biological \nproperties.\nPURPOSE: The aim of the present double-blind randomized controlled trial was to \nevaluate the effects, in terms of pain control and functional recovery, provided \nby a single HA injection performed at the end of arthroscopic meniscectomy.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\nMETHODS: A total of 90 patients, 18 to 55 years old, were included according to \nthe following criteria: (1) chronic, symptomatic meniscal tears requiring \npartial resection; (2) a healthy contralateral knee; (3) no previous surgery on \nthe index knee; and (4) no other concurrent articular lesions requiring surgical \ntreatment (eg, cartilage or ligament injuries). Patients were randomized into 2 \ntreatment groups: one underwent meniscectomy alone, whereas the other also \nreceived an injection of 3 mL HA at the end of the procedure. All patients were \nevaluated at baseline and then at 15, 30, 60, and 180 days using the following \ntools: International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective, Knee injury \nand Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, VAS \nfor general health status, and Tegner scores. The transpatellar circumference \nand active and passive ranges of motion were also recorded during the follow-up \nevaluations.\nRESULTS: No major adverse events were reported using HA postoperatively. A \nstatistically significant increase in all the clinical scores was reported in \nboth treatment groups, but no significant intergroup difference was documented \nat any follow-up evaluation. No difference was observed also in the objective \nmeasurements. The mean time to return to full sports activity was not different \nbetween groups, and a comparable satisfaction rate was recorded in both \ntreatment groups.\nCONCLUSION: Early postoperative viscosupplementation did not provide significant \nclinical benefits after arthroscopic meniscectomy. Despite the lack of major \nadverse events, the administration of a single HA injection at the end of the \nsurgical procedure is not a successful strategy to provide either faster \nfunctional recovery or symptomatic improvement after meniscectomy.",

So far, estimation by \neye and palpation is the standard procedure to intraoperatively assess the \ndistance of the cup to the anterior rim. However, novel technologies such as \nimageless navigation enable intraoperative measurements of the cup in relation \nto the psoas tendon and bony landmarks.\nQUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether psoas impingement can be reduced using \nimageless navigation compared with the standard technique.\nMETHODS: The current study is a reanalysis of data from a randomized controlled \ntrial evaluating navigation for THA; 135 patients were randomized for surgery \nwith or without the use of imageless navigation. The primary outcome was the \nrisk for anterior protrusion of the cup above the acetabular rim and thus \npotential psoas impingement, defined as an overhang of the cup above the \nanterior acetabular rim as measured on postoperative CT, which was either \ncontrolled with the help of navigation or standard control by eye and palpation \nintraoperatively. Postoperatively, the anterior protrusion of the cup above the \nacetabular rim was measured on three-dimensional (3-D) CT by a blinded, external \ninstitute. In addition to patient-related outcome measures, the Harris hip \nscore, Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and EuroQol were \nobtained 1 year postoperatively. Altogether 123 data sets were available for \nprimary analysis and 115 were available for 1-year followup.\nRESULTS: There was no difference, with the numbers available, between the \nnavigated and the control groups in terms of the mean distance of the cup below \nthe anterosuperior acetabular rim (3.9 mm; -5.3 to 12.6 mm versus 4.4 mm; -7.9 \nto 13.7 mm; p = 0.72) or the anteroinferior acetabular rim (4.7 mm; -6.2 to 14.8 \nmm versus 4.2 mm; -7.1 to 16.3 mm; p = 0.29). There was no difference, with the \nnumbers available, in terms of the proportion of cups with anterior overhang \n(7%, four of 57 versus, 15%, 10 of 66; p = 0.16), respectively. After \ncontrolling for potential confounding variables such as cup inclination, cup \nsize, patient age, BMI, stage of arthritis, and length of skin incision, we \nfound cup anteversion (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% CI, 0.81-0.93; p < 0.001) \nand female sex (HR, 3.88; 95% CI, 1.01-14.93; p = 0.049) were associated with a \npropensity to potential psoas impingement.

Participants were randomly divided into three groups: EXER, exercise program; EXER + CBT, exercise program plus support group sessions for lifestyle modification, with a CBT; and CONTROL, routine treatment. The primary outcome was weight change. They were compared on weight, functional capacity, and cardiometabolic profile.\n\nResults: The weight change (Kg) was -7.4 (-9.6 to 5,1); -4,2 (-6,8 to -1.6) and 2.9 (0.4 to 5.3) and the BMI change (kg/m2) was -2.7 (-3.6 to -1.8); -1.4 (-2.4 to -0.4) and 1.1 (0.1 to 2.1) for groups EXER, EXER + CBT, and CONTROL, respectively. Changes were significant when compared to the control group (p < 0.001), but there were no differences between the two intervention arms (p = 0.2). Functional capacity and cardiometabolic parameters improved in the intervention arms and worsened in the control group. The adherence to the exercise program in both groups was above 78 %.\n\nConclusion: The exercise program was more effective than routine treatment on weight change in morbidly obese individuals awaiting bariatric surgery.",

One group received preemptive intra-articular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection, and the second group received preemptive periacetabular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection. Before closure all patients received an additional dose of 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% intra-articularly. Data were compared with respect to postoperative pain with visual analog scale (VAS) and analgesic consumption, documented in a pain diary for 2 weeks after surgery.\n\nResults: Twenty-one patients were treated with intra-articular injection, and 21 patients with peri-acetabular injection. There were no significant differences with regards to patient demographics or surgical procedures. VAS scores recorded during the first 30 minutes postoperatively and 18 hours after surgery were significantly lower in the periacetabular group compared with in the intra-articular group (0.667 \u00b1 1.49 vs 2.11 \u00b1 2.29; P < .045 and 2.62 \u00b1 2.2 vs 4.79 \u00b1 2.6; P < .009). There were no differences between the groups with regard to analgesic consumption.\n\nConclusions: Periacetabular injection of bupivacaine 0.5% was superior to intra-articular injection in pain reduction after hip arthroscopy at 30 minutes and 18 hours postoperatively. However, total analgesic consumption over the first 2 postoperative weeks and VAS pain measurements were not significantly affected.",

One group received preemptive intra-articular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection, and the second group received preemptive periacetabular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection. Before closure all patients received an additional dose of 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% intra-articularly. Data were compared with respect to postoperative pain with visual analog scale (VAS) and analgesic consumption, documented in a pain diary for 2 weeks after surgery.\n\nResults: Twenty-one patients were treated with intra-articular injection, and 21 patients with peri-acetabular injection. There were no significant differences with regards to patient demographics or surgical procedures. VAS scores recorded during the first 30 minutes postoperatively were 0.667 \u00b1 1.49 in the periacetabular group versus 2.11 \u00b1 2.29 in the intra-articular group (P < .045). VAS scores at 18 hours after surgery were 2.62 \u00b1 2.2 in the periacetabular group versus 4.79 \u00b1 2.6 in the intra-articular group (P < .009). There were no differences between the groups with regard to analgesic consumption.\n\nConclusions: The periacetabular injection was not more effective than intra-articular injection for postoperative pain control in patients undergoing hip arthroscopy.",

We \ncarried out a prospective randomized study to compare two different bands.\nMETHODS: Between January 1, 2009 and January 31, 2010, 103 morbidly obese \npatients were randomized between SAGB and MiniMizer Extra adjustable gastric \nbands. The SAGB was used in 49 and MiniMizer Extra in 54 patients. The primary outcome was weight loss. Secondary outcomes included comorbidities, long-term complications, and quality of life, which were evaluated after 5 years.\nRESULTS: Patient baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. The \nmean patient age was 45.9 \u00b1 11.7 years, and mean preoperative BMI was \n47.5 \u00b1 7.3 kg/m2. A total of 90 of 103 patients (87.3 %) completed the 5-year \nfollow-up. The mean excess weight loss was 44.1 and 50.3 % in SAGB and MiniMizer \ngroups, respectively (p = 0.14). Complications developed in 15 patients (14.5 %) and consisted \nof 5 band erosions, 4 port-related complications, 3 band slippages, and 3 band \nintolerances. All five band erosions developed in MiniMizer Extra group, but the \ndifference was not significant (p = 0.058). No difference was found regarding \npostoperative complications, resolution of comorbidities, and quality of life \nbetween compared groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: SAGB was not more effective than MiniMizer Extra bands regarding weight loss in morbidly obese patients.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Various types of adjustable gastric bands are used during LAGB, but \nthere is insufficient data comparing different bands in the long term. We \ncarried out a prospective randomized study to compare two different bands.\nMETHODS: Between January 1, 2009 and January 31, 2010, 103 morbidly obese \npatients were randomized between SAGB and MiniMizer Extra adjustable gastric \nbands. The SAGB was used in 49 and MiniMizer Extra in 54 patients. Weight loss, \ncomorbidities, long-term complications, and quality of life were evaluated after \n5\u0412\u00a0years.\nRESULTS: Patient baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. The \nmean patient age was 45.9\u0412\u00a0\u0412\u00b1\u0412\u00a011.7\u0412\u00a0years, and mean preoperative BMI was \n47.5\u0412\u00a0\u0412\u00b1\u0412\u00a07.3\u0412\u00a0kg/m2. A total of 90 of 103 patients (87.3\u0412\u00a0%) completed the 5-year \nfollow-up. The mean excess weight loss was 44.1 and 50.3\u0412\u00a0% in SAGB and MiniMizer \ngroups, respectively (p\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a00.14). A proportion of patients who reached a \nBMI\u0412\u00a0<\u0412\u00a035\u0412\u00a0kg/m2 was significantly larger in MiniMizer Extra group (52.9 vs \n25.5\u0412\u00a0%; p\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a00.01). Complications developed in 15 patients (14.5\u0412\u00a0%) and consisted \nof 5 band erosions, 4 port-related complications, 3 band slippages, and 3 band \nintolerances. All five band erosions developed in MiniMizer Extra group, but the \ndifference was not significant (p\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a00.058). No difference was found regarding \npostoperative complications, resolution of comorbidities, and quality of life \nbetween compared groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: SAGB and MiniMizer Extra bands demonstrated similar long-term \nresults regarding the weight loss, resolution of comorbidities, morbidity, and \nquality of life.",

Diazepam and meclizine are oral medications that \nare commonly used to alleviate symptoms.\nOBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether meclizine or diazepam is superior in \nthe treatment of patients with peripheral vertigo in the ED.\nMETHODS: We performed a double-blind clinical trial at a suburban, teaching ED. \nWe randomized a convenience sample of adult patients with acute peripheral \nvertigo (APV) to diazepam 5 mg or meclizine 25 mg orally. Demographic and \nhistorical features were recorded on a standardized data form. Patients recorded \ntheir initial level (t0) of vertigo on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) and \nafter 30 min (t30) and 60 min (t60). The primary outcome parameter was the mean \nchange in VAS score from t0 to t60. Differences between groups and 95% \nconfidence intervals were calculated. Our a priori power calculation estimated \nthat a sample size of 20 patients in each group was required to have an 80% \npower to detect a difference of 20 mm between treatment groups.\nRESULTS: There were 20 patients in the diazepam group and 20 in the meclizine \ngroup. The two groups were similar with respect to patient demographics and \npresenting signs and symptoms. At t60, the mean change in VAS score in the diazepam group was 36 and in the meclizine group was 40 (difference -4; 95% confidence \ninterval -20 to 12; p = 0.60).\nCONCLUSION: Diazepam was not more effective than meclizine for the treatment of ED patients with acute peripheral vertigo.",

Patients recorded \ntheir initial level (t0) of vertigo on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) and \nafter 30\u0412\u00a0min (t30) and 60\u0412\u00a0min (t60). The primary outcome parameter was the mean \nchange in VAS score from t0 to t60. Differences between groups and 95% \nconfidence intervals were calculated. Our a priori power calculation estimated \nthat a sample size of 20 patients in each group was required to have an 80% \npower to detect a difference of 20\u0412\u00a0mm between treatment groups.\nRESULTS: There were 20 patients in the diazepam group and 20 in the meclizine \ngroup. The two groups were similar with respect to patient demographics and \npresenting signs and symptoms. At t60, the mean improvements in the diazepam and \nmeclizine groups were 36 and 40, respectively (difference -4; 95% confidence \ninterval -20 to 12; p\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a00.60).\nCONCLUSION: We found no difference between oral diazepam and oral meclizine for \nthe treatment of ED patients with acute peripheral vertigo.",

However, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a major \nconcern. 5-Hydroxytryptamine receptor 3 (5-HT3) antagonists like ondansetron and \nramosetron are commonly used for preventing PONV, but the optimal choice remains \nunclear.\nMETHODS: Patients were randomized preoperatively to either intravenous \nondansetron (8 mg) or ramosetron (0.3 mg). The primary outcomes were the \nincidence rates of PONV. Secondary outcomes were the need for a rescue \nantiemetic (metoclopramide), pain score, patient satisfaction, and adverse drug \nreactions (ADRs) at 0-6, 6-12, 12-24, and 24-48 hours.\nRESULTS: Ninety patients were evaluable; 45 patients/arm. Compared with \nondansetron, ramosetron was associated with lower incidence rates \nof nausea at: (1) 12-18 hours: 3/45 vs 11/45 (P = .016), (2) 18-24 hours: 1/45 \nvs 9/45 (P = .005), and vomiting at 18-24 hours: 1/45 vs 6/45 (P = .044).

        "abstract": "Objective: To assess the efficacy of a programme of supervised physiotherapy on the recovery of simple grade 1 and 2 ankle sprains.\n\nDesign: A randomised controlled trial of 503 participants followed for six months.\n\nSetting: Participants were recruited from two tertiary acute care settings in Kingston, ON, Canada.\n\nParticipants: The broad inclusion criteria were patients aged \u045616 presenting for acute medical assessment and treatment of a simple grade 1 or 2 ankle sprain. Exclusions were patients with multiple injuries, other conditions limiting mobility, and ankle injuries that required immobilisation and those unable to accommodate the time intensive study protocol.\n\nIntervention: Participants received either usual care, consisting of written instructions regarding protection, rest, cryotherapy, compression, elevation, and graduated weight bearing activities, or usual care enhanced with a supervised programme of physiotherapy.\n\nMain outcome measures: The primary outcome of efficacy was the proportion of participants reporting excellent recovery assessed with the foot and ankle outcome score (FAOS). Excellent recovery was defined as a score \u0456450/500 at three months. A difference of at least 15% increase in the absolute proportion of participants with excellent recovery was deemed clinically important. Secondary analyses included the assessment of excellent recovery at one and six months; change from baseline using continuous scores at one, three, and six months; and clinical and biomechanical measures of ankle function, assessed at one, three, and six months.\n\nResults: The absolute proportion of patients achieving excellent recovery at three months was not significantly different between the physiotherapy (98/229, 43%) and usual care (79/214, 37%) arms (absolute difference 6%, 95% confidence interval -3% to 15%). The observed trend towards benefit with physiotherapy did not increase in the per protocol analysis and was in the opposite direction by six months. These trends remained similar and were never statistically or clinically important when the FAOS was analysed as a continuous change score.\n\nConclusions: In a general population of patients seeking hospital based acute care for simple ankle sprains, there is no evidence to support a clinically important improvement in outcome with the addition of supervised physiotherapy to usual care, as provided in this protocol.",

Preoperative dose, an additional postoperative dose, and 2 postoperative additional doses of TA were infused intravenously in groups A (30 mg/kg), B (15 mg/kg), and C (10 mg/kg), respectively, and TA was not infused in group D. Blood loss (intraoperative, postoperative, and total blood loss), blood transfusion rate and volume, hemoglobin level, and incidence of deep vein thrombosis were analyzed.\n\nResults: The total blood loss and postoperative blood loss were significantly lower in groups B and C without any difference between them. As for intraoperative blood loss, there was no significant difference between groups A and B and between groups B and C with superior efficacy than group D.\n\nConclusion: With the same total dose of TA, the preoperative dose and an additional dose of TA were superior to a single preoperative dose of TA in reducing blood loss in TKA. Besides, 1 additional dose was comparable to 2 additional doses of TA in reducing blood loss.",

Preoperative dose, an additional postoperative dose, and 2 postoperative additional doses of TA were infused intravenously in groups A (30 mg/kg), B (15 mg/kg), and C (10 mg/kg), respectively, and TA was not infused in group D. Blood loss (intraoperative, postoperative, and total blood loss), blood transfusion rate and volume, hemoglobin level, and incidence of deep vein thrombosis were analyzed.\n\nResults: The total blood loss and postoperative blood loss were significantly lower in groups B and C compared to group D. There was no significant difference between groups B and C. For intraoperative blood loss, there was no significant difference between groups A and B and between groups B and C. Groups A, B, and C had lower intraoperative blood loss compared to group D.\n\nConclusion: The preoperative dose and an additional dose of TA was not more effective than 2 additional doses of TA in reducing blood loss in patients undergoing TKA.",

Included patients met the migraine criteria of the International Headache Society. Patients were randomized to intranasal lidocaine or saline solution; all participants received 10 mg of intravenous metoclopramide. Patient pain intensity was assessed with an 11-point numeric rating scale score. The primary outcome measure was the change in pain scores at 15 minutes; secondary outcomes were changes in pain intensity after pain onset and need for rescue medication.\n\nResults: Patients (n=162) were randomized into 2 groups with similar baseline migraine characteristics and numeric rating scale scores. The median reduction in numeric rating scale score at 15 minutes was 3 (interquartile range [IQR] 2 to 5) for the lidocaine group and 2 (IQR 1 to 4) for the saline solution group (median difference=1.0; 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 2.1). The reduction in pain score at 30 minutes was 4 (IQR 3 to 7) for the lidocaine group and 5 (IQR 2 to 7) for the saline solution group (median difference=1.0; 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 2.1). Need for rescue medication did not differ between the groups, and local irritation was the most common adverse event in the lidocaine group.\n\nConclusion: Although intranasal lidocaine was found no more efficacious than normal saline solution in our study, future studies should focus on patients who present earlier after headache onset.",

        "abstract": "Study objective: The study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intranasal lidocaine administration for migraine treatment.\n\nMethods: This single-center, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial was conducted in a tertiary care emergency department. Included patients met the migraine criteria of the International Headache Society. Patients were randomized to intranasal lidocaine or saline solution; all participants received 10 mg of intravenous metoclopramide. Patient pain intensity was assessed with an 11-point numeric rating scale score. The primary outcome measure was the change in pain scores at 15 minutes; secondary outcomes were changes in pain intensity at 30 minutes and need for rescue medication.\n\nResults: Patients (n=162) were randomized into 2 groups with similar baseline migraine characteristics and numeric rating scale scores. The median reduction in numeric rating scale score at 15 minutes was 3 (interquartile range [IQR] 2 to 5) for the lidocaine group and 2 (IQR 1 to 4) for the saline solution group (median difference=1.0; 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 2.1). The reduction in pain score at 30 minutes was 4 (IQR 3 to 7) for the lidocaine group and 5 (IQR 2 to 7) for the saline solution group (median difference=1.0; 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 2.1). Need for rescue medication did not differ between the groups, and local irritation was the most common adverse event in the lidocaine group.\n\nConclusion: Intranasal lidocaine was not more effective than saline solution in patients with migraine.",

Participants who \nreceived the highest dose of L. reuteri exhibited increases in insulin \nsensitivity index (ISI) and serum levels of the secondary bile acid deoxycholic \nacid (DCA) compared with baseline, but these differences were not significant in \nthe between-group analyses. Post hoc analysis showed that participants who \nresponded with increased ISI after L. reuteri supplementation had higher \nmicrobial diversity at baseline, and increased serum levels of DCA after \nsupplementation. In addition, increases in DCA levels correlated with \nimprovement in insulin sensitivity in the probiotic recipients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Intake of L. reuteri DSM 17938 for 12\u0432\u0402\u2030weeks did not affect HbA1c in \npeople with type 2 diabetes on insulin therapy; however, L. reuteri improved \ninsulin sensitivity in a subset of participants and we propose that high \ndiversity of the gut microbiota at baseline may be important.",

The Activity intervention included a 45-minute, 3-day per week supervised training program, while the Diet & Activity intervention included a supplementary 15 minutes of group-based sessions attended by the parents. The intervention lasted 3 months and the participants were followed for another 3 months after the intervention. The participants were assessed for anthropometric measures and activity and fulfilled the modified version of the questionnaire \"Family Eating and Activity Habits Questionnaire\" (FEAHQ).\n\nResults: Both \"Activity\" only and \"Diet & Activity\" groups reduced significantly (p < 0.001) their mean body mass index (BMI) (-1.1, 95% CI -1.3, -0.8, and -1.4, 95% CI -1.7, -1.2, respectively), waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulses per minute, and 50 m sprint run test at 3 months, while greater reductions in BMI were observed at 6 months (-2.3, 95% CI -2.6, -2.0, and -3.1, 95% CI -3.3, -2.8). Significant changes in the total FEAHQ score were achieved only in the \"Diet & Activity\" group both at 3 months and at 6 months.\n\nConclusions: FETA resulted in significant effects on improving adiposity profiles in overweight and obese adolescents, as well as family activity and feeding habits, maintained at 3 months follow-up.",

One hundred one patients were randomized to receive either TXA or an equivalent volume of normal saline. The primary outcome measure was thigh swelling. Secondary outcome measures included, visual analogue pain score, timed up and go test, a 10 meter walk test, and length of stay. Blood loss and the incidence of blood transfusions were also recorded.\n\nResults: There were no statistically significant differences between the primary outcome of thigh swelling or the secondary outcome measures of postoperative pain nor mobility. There was a significant reduction in length of stay for those that received TXA 3.58 days (0.84) compared with the control group 4.27 days (0.98) (P < .001). There was significantly less intraoperative blood loss observed in the TXA group (0.460L SD 0.228) compared with the control group (0.687L SD 0.283L) (P < .001). The estimated blood loss was also significantly less in the TXA group (1.084L SD 0.440) compared with the control group (1.394 L SD 0.426).\n\nConclusion: TXA is an effective agent in reducing blood loss in total hip arthroplasty using the anterior approach. The blood conserving effect of TXA was not associated with improved postoperative recovery across the measures of pain and mobility.",

One hundred one patients were randomized to receive either TXA or an equivalent volume of normal saline. The primary outcome measure was thigh swelling. Secondary outcome measures included visual analogue pain score, timed up and go test, a 10 meter walk test, length of stay, blood loss, and the incidence of blood transfusions.\n\nResults: There were no statistically significant differences between the primary outcome of thigh swelling or the secondary outcome measures of postoperative pain nor mobility. Length of stay was 3.58 days (0.84) for those that received TXA compared with the control group 4.27 days (0.98) (P < .001). Intraoperative blood loss was 0.460L (SD 0.228) in the TXA group compared with the control group 0.687L (SD 0.283L) (P < .001). The estimated blood loss was 1.084L (SD 0.440) in the TXA group compared with the control group 1.394 L (SD 0.426).\n\nConclusion: TXA was not more effective than placebo on thigh swelling in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty using the anterior approach.",

There are few studies \nthat provide evidence that this remains true in the long term.\nPURPOSE: To compare the long-term results of patellar instability after TTT with \nand without MPFL reconstruction in 2 randomized groups.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\nMETHODS: A total of 34 patients (36 knees) were randomized to 2 groups. The \nfirst group underwent lateral release (LR) and TTT for confirmed maltracking of \nthe patella (control group). The second group underwent MPFL reconstruction in \naddition to TTT and LR (reconstruction group). The primary outcomes were \nvalidated questionnaires (Kujala score, Tegner activity score) and a visual \nanalog scale (VAS) assessing their insecurity. Secondary outcomes included \nclinical assessment, redislocation rates, reoperation rates, time to return to \nactivities, patient satisfaction, and quantitative computed tomography (CT) at 1 \nyear. Patients were followed up at a minimum of 5 years postoperatively. Two \npatients in the control group and 1 patient in the reconstruction group were \nlost to follow-up at 5 years.\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences in the Kujala (P = .75), Tegner \n(P = .36), or VAS (P = .75) scores at any time period. One patient in the \ncontrol group sustained a patellar redislocation at 3 years. Five patients in \nthe control group and 2 in the reconstruction group had functional failures and \nrequired reoperations; however, this was not statistically significant (P = \n.30). There were no significant differences between groups in the time to return \nto school or work (P = .65) or sports (P = .38) after surgery. Patient \nsatisfaction was higher in the reconstruction group compared with the control \ngroup (P = .04), and quantitative CT scans showed that the reconstruction group \nhad improvement in the mean patellar tilt (6\u00b0 vs -8\u00b0, respectively; P = .03) and \nmean congruence angle (13\u00b0 vs -11\u00b0, respectively; P = .03) in the \nquadriceps-contracted state compared with the control group.\nCONCLUSION: TTT with MPFL reconstruction was not more effective than TTT alone \non the primary functional outcomes (Kujala score, Tegner activity score, VAS) in \npatients with patellar instability.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tibial tubercle transfer (TTT) and medial patellofemoral ligament \n(MPFL) reconstruction have both shown, either in isolation or in combination, to \nprovide improved patellofemoral joint (PFJ) stability. There are few studies \nthat provide evidence that this remains true in the long term.\nPURPOSE: To compare the long-term results of patellar instability after TTT with \nand without MPFL reconstruction in 2 randomized groups.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\nMETHODS: A total of 34 patients (36 knees) were randomized to 2 groups. The \nfirst group underwent lateral release (LR) and TTT for confirmed maltracking of \nthe patella (control group). The second group underwent MPFL reconstruction in \naddition to TTT and LR (reconstruction group). Patients were followed up with \nvalidated questionnaires (Kujala score, Tegner activity score), a visual analog \nscale (VAS) assessing their insecurity, and a clinical assessment at a minimum \nof 5 years postoperatively. Participants also underwent quantitative computed \ntomography (CT) at 1 year for comparison. Two patients in the control group and \n1 patient in the reconstruction group were lost to follow-up at 5 years.\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences in the Kujala ( P = .75), Tegner \n( P = .36), or VAS ( P = .75) scores at any time period. One patient in the \ncontrol group sustained a patellar redislocation at 3 years. Five patients in \nthe control group and 2 in the reconstruction group had functional failures and \nrequired reoperations; however, this was not statistically significant ( P = \n.30). There were no significant differences between groups in the time to return \nto school or work ( P = .65) or sports ( P = .38) after surgery. Overall patient \nsatisfaction was higher in the reconstruction group compared with the control \ngroup ( P = .04), and quantitative CT scans showed that the reconstruction group \nhad a statistically significant improvement in the mean patellar tilt (6\u0412\u00b0 vs \n-8\u0412\u00b0, respectively; P = .03) and mean congruence angle (13\u0412\u00b0 vs -11\u0412\u00b0, \nrespectively; P = .03) in the quadriceps-contracted state compared with the \ncontrol group.\nCONCLUSION: Reconstruction of the MPFL in addition to TTT and LR resulted in \nimproved alignment parameters (congruence angle, patellar tilt angle) as well as \npatient satisfaction. The Kujala and Tegner scores were no different between the \n2 groups at any time period. There was insufficient evidence to conclude that \nthe addition of MPFL reconstruction to TTT results in fewer redislocations or \nreoperations. This study concludes that MPFL reconstruction improves PFJ \nalignment and patient satisfaction; however, further studies with larger patient \nnumbers are required to satisfy its significance with respect to redislocation \nrates and functional scores in the long term.",

The primary outcome was the anatomic \nstatus of tenodesis estimated using magnetic resonance imaging or \nultrasonography. Anatomic failure of tenodesis was determined when the biceps \ntendon was not traced in the intertubercular groove directly from the insertion \nsite of the IS or SA. Secondary outcomes included functional outcomes evaluated \nwith the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, American Shoulder and Elbow \nSurgeons (ASES) score, Simple Shoulder Test (SST), Constant score, Korean \nShoulder Score (KSS), and long head of the biceps (LHB) score at least 2 years \nafter surgery.\nRESULTS: Thirty-three patients in the IS group and 34 in the SA group were \nmonitored for more than 2 years. Nine anatomic failures of tenodesis were \nobserved: 7 in the IS group and 2 in the SA group (P = .083). All postoperative \nfunctional scores improved compared with the preoperative scores and were not \nsignificantly different between the groups, including the LHB score (all P > \n.05). In a multivariate analysis using logistic regression, IS fixation (P = \n.003) and a higher work level (P = .022) were factors associated with the \nanatomic failure of tenodesis. In patients with tenodesis failure, the LHB score \n(P = .049) and the degree of Popeye deformity by the patient and examiner (P = \n.004 and .018, respectively) were statistically different compared with patients \nwith intact tenodeses.\nCONCLUSION: The IS fixation technique was not more effective than SA fixation \ntechnique in preventing anatomic failure of tenodesis in patients with SLBC \nlesions undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.",

The anatomic status of tenodesis was estimated using magnetic \nresonance imaging or ultrasonography, and the anatomic failure of tenodesis was \ndetermined when the biceps tendon was not traced in the intertubercular groove \ndirectly from the insertion site of the IS or SA.\nRESULTS: Thirty-three patients in the IS group and 34 in the SA group were \nmonitored for more than 2 years. All postoperative functional scores improved \nsignificantly compared with the preoperative scores (all P < .001) and were not \nsignificantly different between the groups, including the LHB score (all P > \n.05). Nine anatomic failures of tenodesis were observed: 7 in the IS group and 2 \nin the SA group ( P = .083). In a multivariate analysis using logistic \nregression, IS fixation ( P = .003) and a higher (ie, more physically demanding) \nwork level ( P = .022) were factors associated with the anatomic failure of \ntenodesis significantly. In patients with tenodesis failure, the LHB score ( P = \n.049) and the degree of Popeye deformity by the patient and examiner ( P = .004 \nand .018, respectively) were statistically different compared with patients with \nintact tenodeses.\nCONCLUSION: Care must be taken while performing biceps tenodesis in patients \nwith a higher work level; IS fixation appears to pose a higher risk in terms of \nthe anatomic failure of tenodesis than SA fixation, although functional outcomes \nwere not different.",

A growing body of evidence strongly suggests that the \nprogression from anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury to PTOA is \nmultifactorial, involving the interplay between biomechanical disturbances and \nbiochemical homeostasis of articular cartilage.\nPURPOSE: The purposes of this randomized study using an acute ACL injury model \nwere to (1) evaluate the natural progression of inflammatory and \nchondrodegenerative biomarkers, (2) evaluate the relationship between subjective \nreports of pain and inflammatory and chondrodegenerative biomarkers, and (3) \ndetermine if postinjury arthrocentesis and corticosteroid injection offer the \nability to alter this biochemical cascade.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.\nMETHODS: A total of 49 patients were randomized to 4 groups: group 1 \n(corticosteroid at 4 days after ACL injury, placebo injection of saline at 2 \nweeks), group 2 (placebo at 4 days after ACL injury, corticosteroid at 2 weeks), \ngroup 3 (corticosteroid at both time intervals), or a placebo group (saline \ninjections at both time intervals). Patient-reported outcome measures and \nsynovial biomarkers were collected at approximately 4 days, 11 days, and 5 weeks \nafter injury. The change between the time points was assessed for all variables \nusing Wilcoxon tests, and the relationship between changes in outcome scores and \nbiomarkers were assessed by calculating Spearman \u041f\u0403. Outcomes and biomarkers were \nalso compared between the 4 groups using Kruskal-Wallis tests.\nRESULTS: No adverse events or infections were observed in any study patients. \nWith the exception of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) and tumor necrosis \nfactor-inducible gene 6 (TSG-6), chondrodegenerative markers worsened over the \nfirst 5 weeks while all patient-reported outcomes improved during this time, \nregardless of treatment group. Patient-reported outcomes did not differ between \npatients receiving corticosteroid injections and the placebo group. However, \nincreases in C-telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II), associated with \ncollagen type II breakdown, were significantly greater in the placebo group \n(1.32 \u0412\u00b1 1.10 ng/mL) than in either of the groups that received the \ncorticosteroid injection within the first several days after injury (group 1: \n0.23 \u0412\u00b1 0.27 ng/mL [ P = .01]; group 3: 0.19 \u0412\u00b1 0.34 ng/mL [ P = .01]).\nCONCLUSION: PTOA begins at the time of injury and results early on in dramatic \nmatrix changes in the knee. However, it is encouraging that early intervention \nwith an anti-inflammatory agent was able to affect biomarkers of chondral \ndegeneration. Should early intervention lead to meaningful changes in either the \nonset or severity of symptomatic PTOA, the current treatment paradigm for \npatients with ACL injury may have to be restructured to include early aspiration \nand intra-articular intervention.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bronchiolitis is the most common lung infection in infants and \ntreatment focuses on management of respiratory distress and hypoxia. High-flow \nwarm humidified oxygen (HFWHO) is increasingly used, but has not been rigorously \nstudied in randomised trials. We aimed to examine whether HFWHO provided \nenhanced respiratory support, thereby shortening time to weaning off oxygen.\nMETHODS: In this open, phase 4, randomised controlled trial, we recruited \nchildren aged less than 24 months with moderate bronchiolitis attending the \nemergency department of the John Hunter Hospital or the medical unit of the John \nHunter Children's Hospital in New South Wales, Australia. Patients were randomly \nallocated (1:1) via opaque sealed envelopes to HFWHO (maximum flow of 1 L/kg per \nmin to a limit of 20 L/min using 1:1 air-oxygen ratio, resulting in a maximum \nFiO2 of 0\u0412\u00b76) or standard therapy (cold wall oxygen 100% via infant nasal \ncannulae at low flow to a maximum of 2 L/min) using a block size of four and \nstratifying for gestational age at birth. The primary outcome was time from \nrandomisation to last use of oxygen therapy. All randomised children were \nincluded in the primary and secondary safety analyses. This trial is registered \nwith the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number \nACTRN12612000685819.\nFINDINGS: From July 16, 2012, to May 1, 2015, we randomly assigned 202 children \nto either HFWHO (101 children) or standard therapy (101 children). Median time \nto weaning was 24 h (95% CI 18-28) for standard therapy and 20 h (95% CI 17-34) \nfor HFWHO (hazard ratio [HR] for difference in survival distributions 0\u0412\u00b79 [95% \nCI 0\u0412\u00b77-1\u0412\u00b72]; log rank p=0\u0412\u00b761). Fewer children experienced treatment failure on \nHFWHO (14 [14%]) compared with standard therapy (33 [33%]; p=0\u0412\u00b70016); of these \nchildren, those on HFWHO were supported for longer than were those on standard \ntherapy before treatment failure (HR 0\u0412\u00b73; 95% CI 0\u0412\u00b72-0\u0412\u00b76; p<0\u0412\u00b70001). 20 (61%) of \n33 children who experienced treatment failure on standard therapy were rescued \nwith HFWHO. 12 (12%) of children on standard therapy required transfer to the \nintensive care unit compared with 14 (14%) of those on HFWHO (difference -1%; \n95% CI -7 to 16; p=0\u0412\u00b741). Four adverse events occurred (oxygen desaturation and \ncondensation inhalation in the HFWHO group, and two incidences of oxygen tubing \ndisconnection in the standard therapy group); none resulted in withdrawal from \nthe trial. No oxygen-related serious adverse events occurred. Secondary \neffectiveness outcomes are reported in the Results section.\nINTERPRETATION: HFWHO did not significantly reduce time on oxygen compared with \nstandard therapy, suggesting that early use of HFWHO does not modify the \nunderlying disease process in moderately severe bronchiolitis. HFWHO might have \na role as a rescue therapy to reduce the proportion of children requiring \nhigh-cost intensive care.",

Regionalisation of care into cardiac \narrest centres (CAC) may improve this. We report a pilot randomised trial of \nexpedited transfer to a CAC following OHCA without ST-elevation. The objective \nwas to assess the feasibility of performing a large-scale randomised controlled \ntrial.\nMETHODS: Adult witnessed ventricular fibrillation OHCA of presumed cardiac cause \nwere randomised 1:1 to either: (1) treatment: comprising expedited transfer to a \nCAC for goal-directed therapy including access to immediate reperfusion, or (2) \ncontrol: comprising current standard of care involving delivery to the \ngeographically closest hospital. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause \nmortality. Secondary outcomes were cerebral performance category (CPC) and \nin-hospital major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE). The \nfeasibility of randomisation, protocol adherence and data collection were \nassessed.\nRESULTS: Between November 2014 and April 2016, 118 cases were screened, of which \n63 patients (53%) met eligibility criteria and 40 of the 63 patients (63%) were \nrandomised. There were no protocol deviations in the treatment arm. Data \ncollection of primary and secondary outcomes was achieved in 83%. There was no \ndifference in baseline characteristics between the groups: 30-day mortality \n(Intervention 9/18, 50% vs. Control 6/15, 40%; P=0.73), CPC 1/2 (Intervention: \n9/18, 50% vs. Control 7/14, 50%; P>0.99) or MACCE (Intervention: 9/18, 50% vs. \nControl 6/15, 40%; P=0.73).\nCONCLUSIONS: Expedited transfer to CAC was not more effective on 30-day \nall-cause mortality than standard care in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac \narrest without ST-elevation.",

Insulin sensitivity was assessed by hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamps and cardiovascular variables were measured.\n\nResults: Uric acid decreased in both groups, but significantly more in the AP than the PP group. There were no significant differences in other variables, although glycated haemoglobin levels, diastolic blood pressure and fasting non-esterified fatty acid levels improved significantly in the PP but not in the AP group. Insulin sensitivity (M-value), C-reactive protein and fasting glucose improved significantly in the AP but not in the PP group. Total and LDL cholesterol levels and systolic blood pressure decreased significantly in both groups, and the urinary albumin excretion rate decreased from baseline in participants with microalbuminuria.\n\nConclusions: Isocaloric diets high in AP or PP allow similar improvements in metabolism and cardiovascular risk factors in people with T2DM, indicating that the differences in amino acid composition do not affect the metabolic responses to the interventions.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Measured resection (MR) and gap balancing (GB) are common surgical \ntechniques for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Controversy has arisen as each \nconceptually differs in how the knee is balanced through bone and soft tissue \nmanagement. The objective of the present study was to compare both the frequency \nof condylar liftoff and the location of femorotibial contact from extension \nthrough midflexion between patients undergoing GB or MR TKA.\nMETHODS: A total of 24 knees (23 patients) were randomly assigned at referral to \neither a surgeon performing MR or GB TKA with the same single radius, \nposterior-stabilized implant (12 per cohort). At 1-year postoperation, patients \nunderwent biplanar radiographic imaging at 0\u0412\u00b0, 20\u0412\u00b0, 40\u0412\u00b0, and 60\u0412\u00b0 of flexion. \nCondylar liftoff, contact location, and magnitude of excursion on each condyle \nwere measured. Preoperative and postoperative clinical outcome scores were also \ncollected.\nRESULTS: There was no difference (P\u0412\u00a0= .41) in the frequency of liftoff between \ncohorts. The MR cohort had more posterior contact on the medial condyle (P < \n.01) and more anterior contact on the lateral condyle (P < .01) throughout \nflexion. Motion patterns were similar between cohorts, with similar medial (P\u0412\u00a0= \n.48) and lateral (P\u0412\u00a0= .44) excursion, which was equal in magnitude between \ncondyles for both MR (P\u0412\u00a0= .48) and GB (P\u0412\u00a0= .73). There was no difference in \nclinical outcome scores between groups.\nCONCLUSION: For this particular implant system, GB and MR appear to produce \nsimilar kinematic and patient-reported outcome results.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Measured resection (MR) and gap balancing (GB) are common surgical \ntechniques for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Controversy has arisen as each \nconceptually differs in how the knee is balanced through bone and soft tissue \nmanagement. The objective of the present study was to compare both the frequency \nof condylar liftoff and the location of femorotibial contact from extension \nthrough midflexion between patients undergoing GB or MR TKA.\nMETHODS: A total of 24 knees (23 patients) were randomly assigned at referral to \neither a surgeon performing MR or GB TKA with the same single radius, \nposterior-stabilized implant (12 per cohort). At 1-year postoperation, patients \nunderwent biplanar radiographic imaging at 0\u00b0, 20\u00b0, 40\u00b0, and 60\u00b0 of flexion. \nCondylar liftoff, contact location, and magnitude of excursion on each condyle \nwere measured. Preoperative and postoperative clinical outcome scores were also \ncollected.\nRESULTS: There was no difference (P = .41) in the frequency of liftoff between \ncohorts. The MR cohort had more posterior contact on the medial condyle (P < \n.01) and more anterior contact on the lateral condyle (P < .01) throughout \nflexion. Motion patterns were similar between cohorts, with similar medial (P = \n.48) and lateral (P = .44) excursion, which was equal in magnitude between \ncondyles for both MR (P = .48) and GB (P = .73). There was no difference in \nclinical outcome scores between groups.\nCONCLUSION: Gap balancing was not more effective than measured resection in \npatients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.",

Intervention subjects received \na 1-month prescription for an inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone or budesonide \nby age) in addition to standard asthma therapy and instructions given to all \npatients. The primary outcome was filling of subsequent inhaled corticosteroid \nprescriptions. Secondary outcomes included filling of the intervention prescription, \nasthma-related symptoms and quality of life, and follow-up rates with a primary \ncare provider. Outcomes were assessed during telephone interviews 2 and 8 weeks \nafter the ED visit and by review of primary care provider and pharmacy records.\nRESULTS: One hundred forty-seven children were enrolled, and baseline measures \nwere similar between groups. In the intervention group, 53.5% of patients filled \nan initial ED prescription for inhaled corticosteroid. There was no important \ndifference between groups in subsequent filling of a primary care provider \nprescription (21% intervention versus 17% control; relative rate=1.24; 95% \nconfidence interval 0.63 to 2.41). Groups did not differ by rates of primary \ncare provider follow-up, functional limitations, or asthma-related symptoms and \nquality of life.\nCONCLUSION: The inhaled corticosteroid prescription was not more effective than \nstandard care in increasing subsequent filling of primary care provider \nprescriptions in children with persistent asthma discharged from the emergency \ndepartment.",

        "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: We determine whether prescribing an inhaled corticosteroid \nduring a pediatric emergency department (ED) asthma visit increases ongoing use \nand improves outcomes.\nMETHODS: This randomized trial enrolled children aged 1 to 18 years, with \npersistent asthma not previously prescribed a controller medication, and who \nwere being discharged after ED asthma treatment. Intervention subjects received \na 1-month prescription for an inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone or budesonide \nby age) in addition to standard asthma therapy and instructions given to all \npatients. Outcomes included filling of the intervention and subsequent inhaled \ncorticosteroid prescriptions, asthma-related symptoms and quality of life, and \nfollow-up rates with a primary care provider. Outcomes were assessed during \ntelephone interviews 2 and 8 weeks after the ED visit and by review of primary \ncare provider and pharmacy records.\nRESULTS: One hundred forty-seven children were enrolled, and baseline measures \nwere similar between groups. In the intervention group, 53.5% of patients filled \nan initial ED prescription for inhaled corticosteroid. There was no important \ndifference between groups in subsequent filling of a primary care provider \nprescription (21% intervention versus 17% control; relative rate=1.24; 95% \nconfidence interval 0.63 to 2.41). During the 2 weeks after the ED visit, \nintervention subjects reported reduced shortness of breath while awake and cough \nwhile asleep compared with controls. Groups did not differ by rates of primary \ncare provider follow-up, functional limitations, or asthma-related symptoms and \nquality of life.\nCONCLUSION: There was no difference in the proportion of patients who filled a \nprimary care provider prescription after ED initiation of an inhaled \ncorticosteroid. The intervention was associated with reduced reported symptoms \nbut did not affect other asthma outcomes or primary care provider follow-up.",

Two groups were \ncreated: V-group (Vicryl\u0412\u00ae 2/0-Ethicon) and S-group (Stratafix\u0432\u201e\u045e 2/0-Ethicon). \nTime spent on closing the enterotomies was measured from first needle in until \nknot and cut (V-group) or last stitch and cut (S-group). If needed, a \nnonabsorbable \"correction\" (\"c\"; in order to close a small hiatus at the \nanastomosis) or hemostatic (\"h\") stitch was made (using a single Prolene\u0412\u00ae \n2/0-Ethicon).\nRESULTS: Average total procedure time was similar (S-group 1:01:22, V-group \n1:00:44, P\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a00.340). Closure of the enterotomy (GJA) was significantly shorter \nin the S-group (07:41\u0412\u00a0min versus 08:13\u0412\u00a0min in the V-group, P\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a00.005). Extra \nstitches (GJA) were performed in 33 patients (16.5%): 3 (h) and 20 (c) in the \nV-group and 1 (h) and 9 (c) in the S-group. Four patients in the V-group \nsuffered from postoperative intraluminal bleeding (3 self-limiting, 1 underwent \nendoscopic clipping). In the S-group, 1 patient suffered from leakage at the \nvertical transected staple line of the stomach.\nCONCLUSIONS: The use of unidirectional barbed sutures for running enterotomy \nclosure after linear stapled RYGB is feasible and safe. Significant time benefit \nwas seen regarding the closure of the GJA. Fewer additional stitches were \nnecessary and postoperative intraluminal bleeding was less encountered.",

To overcome the shortcomings of the microfracture technique, \nvarious augmentation techniques have been developed. However, their efficacies \nremain unclear.\nHYPOTHESIS: The quality of cartilage repair and clinical outcomes would be \nsuperior in patients undergoing high tibial osteotomy (HTO) with microfracture \nand collagen augmentation compared to those undergoing HTO with microfracture \nalone without collagen augmentation for the treatment of medial compartment \nosteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.\nMETHODS: Twenty-eight patients undergoing HTO were randomized into 2 groups: \nmicrofracture alone (group 1, n = 14) or microfracture with collagen \naugmentation (group 2, n = 14). At 1 year postoperatively, second-look \narthroscopic surgery and biopsy of repaired cartilage were performed at the time \nof HTO plate removal. Biopsy specimens were graded using the International \nCartilage Repair Society Visual Assessment Scale II (ICRS II). In addition, \nimaging outcomes in terms of the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage \nrepair tissue (MOCART) score were assessed based on magnetic resonance imaging \n(MRI). Finally, clinical outcomes in terms of the visual analog scale (VAS) for \npain score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International \nKnee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and Tegner activity scale score were \nevaluated.\nRESULTS: The mean ICRS II score in group 2 was significantly higher than that in \ngroup 1 (1053.2 vs 885.4, respectively; P = .002). Group 2 showed greater \nimprovement in tissue morphology, cell morphology, surface architecture, \nmiddle/deep zone assessment, and overall assessment compared with group 1 ( P < \n.050 for all comparisons). Imaging outcomes based on the MOCART score were \nsuperior in group 2 compared to those in group 1 on MRI at 1 year \npostoperatively (64.6 vs 45.4, respectively; P = .001). The degree of defect \nrepair was better in group 2 than in group 1 ( P = .040). Clinical outcomes in \nterms of the VAS for pain score, KOOS, IKDC score, and Tegner activity scale \nscore were improved in both groups without between-group differences ( P > .100 \nfor all comparisons).\nCONCLUSION: The quality of cartilage repair after microfracture with collagen \naugmentation was superior to that after microfracture alone in patients \nundergoing HTO. Clinical results after 1 year did not reflect this difference in \ntissue repair. Therefore, a longer follow-up of the cohort is needed to answer \nthis question.",

An \nideal pain control method would have few side effects, decreased opioid \nconsumption, improved pain control, early ambulation, and decreased hospital \nlength of stay (LOS).\nMETHODS: We performed a prospective randomized, controlled study involving 79 \npatients undergoing elective THA between June 2015 and February 2016. Forty \npatients received liposomal bupivacaine and 39 patients received a fascia iliaca \ncompartment block (FICB). In addition, the medical records of 28 patients who \nunderwent elective THA between May 2015 and December 2015 were retrospectively \nexamined. The primary outcome was visual analog scale pain scores and the \nsecondary outcomes were LOS and total opioid consumption. SPSS, version 22, was \nused to run 1-way analysis of variance with contrast and Mood's median test on \nthe data.\nRESULTS: There were statistically significant decreases in pain intensity (P\u0412\u00a0= \n.019) and LOS (P\u0412\u00a0= .041) in both the liposomal bupivacaine group and the FICB \ngroup compared with those in the retrospective control group. In addition, only \nthe FICB group showed statistically significant decreased total opioid \nconsumption compared with that in the retrospective group (P\u0412\u00a0= .028).\nCONCLUSION: Patients undergoing elective THA have decreased overall pain \nintensity and a shorter LOS with multimodal pain management regimen that \nincludes either liposomal bupivacaine or FICB. Patients who received FICB \nrequired less overall total opioids than the control group.",

Biological analysis of PRP has demonstrated an anti-inflammatory effect on the intra-articular environment.\n\nPurpose: To compare the clinical and biological effects of an intra-articular injection of PRP with those of an intra-articular injection of HA in patients with mild to moderate knee OA.\n\nStudy design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\n\nMethods: A total of 111 patients with symptomatic unilateral knee OA received a series of either leukocyte-poor PRP or HA injections under ultrasound guidance. Clinical data were collected before treatment and at 4 time points across a 1-year period. Synovial fluid was also collected for analysis of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers before treatment and at 12 and 24 weeks after treatment. Several measures were used to assess results: (1) Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale; (2) International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee evaluation, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, and Lysholm knee score; and (3) difference in intra-articular biochemical marker concentrations.\n\nResults: There were 49 patients randomized to treatment with PRP and 50 randomized to treatment with HA. No difference was seen between the groups in the primary outcome measure (WOMAC pain score). In the secondary outcome measure, linear contrasts identified a significantly higher IKDC score in the PRP group compared with the HA group at 24 weeks (mean \u00b1 standard error [SE], 65.5 \u00b1 3.6 vs 55.8 \u00b1 3.8, respectively; P = .013) and at final follow-up (52 weeks) (57.6 \u00b1 3.37 vs 46.6 \u00b1 3.76, respectively; P = .003). Linear contrasts also identified a statistically lower VAS score in the PRP group versus the HA group at 24 weeks (mean \u00b1 SE, 34.6 \u00b1 3.24 vs 48.6 \u00b1 3.7, respectively; P = .0096) and 52 weeks (44 \u00b1 4.6 vs 57.3 \u00b1 3.8, respectively; P = .0039). An examination of fixed effects showed that patients with mild OA and a lower body mass index had a statistically significant improvement in outcomes. In the biochemical analysis, differences between groups approached significance for interleukin-1_ (mean \u00b1 SE, 0.14 \u00b1 0.05 pg/mL [PRP] vs 0.34 \u00b1 0.16 pg/mL [HA]; P = .06) and tumor necrosis factor _ (0.08 \u00b1 0.01 pg/mL [PRP] vs 0.2 \u00b1 0.18 pg/mL [HA]; P = .068) at 12-week follow-up.\n\nConclusion: We found no difference between HA and PRP at any time point in the primary outcome measure: the patient-reported WOMAC pain score. Significant improvements were seen in other patient-reported outcome measures, with results favoring PRP over HA. Preceding a significant difference in subjective outcomes favoring PRP, there was a trend toward a decrease in 2 proinflammatory cytokines, which suggest that the anti-inflammatory properties of PRP may contribute to an improvement of symptoms.",

Biological analysis of PRP has demonstrated an anti-inflammatory effect on the intra-articular environment.\n\nPurpose: To compare the clinical and biological effects of an intra-articular injection of PRP with those of an intra-articular injection of HA in patients with mild to moderate knee OA.\n\nStudy design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\n\nMethods: A total of 111 patients with symptomatic unilateral knee OA received a series of either leukocyte-poor PRP or HA injections under ultrasound guidance. Clinical data were collected before treatment and at 4 time points across a 1-year period. Synovial fluid was also collected for analysis of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers before treatment and at 12 and 24 weeks after treatment. Several measures were used to assess results: (1) Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale (primary outcome); (2) International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee evaluation, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, and Lysholm knee score; and (3) difference in intra-articular biochemical marker concentrations.\n\nResults: There were 49 patients randomized to treatment with PRP and 50 randomized to treatment with HA.

Moderators were examined as \nan exploratory aim.\nMETHODS: Adults (N\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030283) were randomly assigned to treatment condition and \nprovided with 26 group-based sessions over the course of 12 months. Weight was \nmeasured in the clinic at months 0, 6, and 12.\nRESULTS: Change in weight over time did not significantly differ by condition. \nHowever, race significantly moderated the effect of condition on weight loss \n(P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u20300.04), such that African-American participants lost less weight than \nnon-Hispanic white participants in the BT (6.2% vs. 11.5%) and BT\u0432\u0402\u2030+\u0432\u0402\u2030E conditions \n(6.6% vs. 12.2%), but weight loss in these two groups was similar in the BT\u0432\u0402\u2030+\u0432\u0402\u2030EA \ncondition (9.4% vs. 11.5%). Among African Americans, rates of achieving a \nclinically significant weight loss (i.e.,\u0432\u0402\u2030>\u0432\u0402\u20305%) at 12 months were higher in \nBT\u0432\u0402\u2030+\u0432\u0402\u2030EA (80%) than BT (57%) or BT\u0432\u0402\u2030+\u0432\u0402\u2030E (48%) (P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u20300.04).\nCONCLUSIONS: This innovative behavioral approach shows promise for treatment of \nAfrican Americans, which is notable given the lack of progress to date \naddressing racial disparities in obesity intervention efficacy.",

Participants were followed by community health workers at set intervals (weekly in months 1-3; biweekly in months 4-9; once monthly in months 10-12).\n\nResults: There was no difference in weight loss at 12 months between participants in the small change approach alone (1.1%) versus the small change PA/SA intervention (1.2%). During treatment, 9% of participants lost at least 7% of their initial body weight. Participants who reported more interval life events had a lower likelihood of losing weight (P < 0.0001). However, those randomized to the small change PA/SA intervention gained less weight (+0.3% vs. 2.3% gain; P < 0.0001).\n\nConclusions: The small change PA/SA intervention did not lead to a significant difference in weight loss in comparison to the small change approach alone. It did, however, decrease the negative impact of psychosocial stressors on weight gain among participants with more interval life events.",

Participants were followed by community health workers at set intervals (weekly in months 1-3; biweekly in months 4-9; once monthly in months 10-12). The primary outcome was weight loss at 12 months.\n\nResults: There was no difference in weight loss at 12 months between participants in the small change approach alone (1.1%) versus the small change PA/SA intervention (1.2%). During treatment, 9% of participants lost at least 7% of their initial body weight.\n\nConclusions: The small change PA/SA intervention was not more effective than the small change approach alone on weight loss in Black and Hispanic adults with body mass index 25-50 kg/m2.",

A total of 101 patients received arthroscopic \nrelease (n\u0412\u00a0= 50) or US-guided PRP injections (n\u0412\u00a0= 51). Outcomes were assessed \nusing a visual analog scale for pain, the Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation \n(PRTEE), and a calibrated hand dynamometer for grip strength.\nRESULTS: Both patient groups experienced significant improvement in all \nmeasures. Between-group comparisons showed a significantly higher value in the \nPRP group only for grip strength at week 8 (P\u0412\u00a0= .0073); all other significant \ndifferences were in favor of arthroscopy: overall pain (P\u0412\u00a0= .0021), night pain \n(P\u0412\u00a0= .0013), and PRTEE score (P\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a0.0013) at week 104 and grip strength at weeks \n24, 52, and 104 (all P < .0001). Consumption of rescue pain medication was not \nsignificantly different between the groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that (1) PRP injections and \narthroscopic extensor carpi radialis brevis release are both effective in the \nshort and medium term; (2) PRP patients experienced a significant worsening of \npain at 2\u0412\u00a0years; (3) arthroscopic release ensured better long-term outcomes in \nterms of pain relief and grip strength recovery; and (4) both procedures were \nsafe and well accepted by patients.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Bariatric surgery is the only treatment option that achieves sustained weight loss in obese patients and that also has positive effects on obesity-related comorbidities. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) seems to achieve equal weight loss as laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), but there is still much debate about the quality of life (QOL) after LSG, mainly concerning the association with gastroesophageal reflux. Our hypothesis is that QOL after LSG is comparable with QOL after LRYGB.\n\nMaterials and methods: Between February 2013 and February 2014, 150 patients were randomized to undergo either LSG or LRYGB in our clinic. Differences in QOL were compared between groups by using multiple QOL questionnaires at follow-up moments preoperatively and 2 and 12 months after surgery.\n\nResults: After 12 months of follow-up, 128 patients had returned the questionnaires. Most QOL questionnaires showed significant improvement in scores between the preoperative moment and after 12 months of follow-up. The Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Questionnaire (GerdQ) score deteriorated in the LSG group after 2 months, but recovered again after 12 months. After 2 months of follow-up, the mean GerdQ score was 6.95 \u00b1 2.14 in the LSG group versus 5.50 \u00b1 1.49 in the LRYGB group (p < 0.001). After 1 year, the mean GerdQ score was 6.63 \u00b1 2.26 in the LSG group and 5.60 \u00b1 1.07 in the LRYGB group (p = 0.001).\n\nConclusion: This randomized controlled trial shows that patients who underwent LSG have significantly higher GerdQ scores at both 2 and 12 months postoperatively than patients who underwent LRYGB, whereas overall QOL did not differ significantly.",

Liposomal bupivacaine (LB) is an extended-release delivery of a \nphospholipid bilayer encapsulating bupivacaine that can result in drug delivery \nup to 72 hours. Prior studies in lower extremity surgery demonstrated efficacy \nof LB in comparison to a single-shot peripheral nerve block; however, no study \nhas investigated LB in a total shoulder arthroplasty population. Therefore, this \nstudy compared LB vs. an indwelling interscalene nerve block (IINB).\nMETHODS: This is a prospective, randomized study of 83 consecutive shoulder \narthroplasty patients; 36 patients received LB and a \"bridge\" of 30 mL of 0.5% \nbupivacaine, and 47 patients received an IINB. The primary outcome was \npostoperative visual analog scale pain levels. Secondary outcomes included \nopiate consumption measured with oral morphine equivalents, length of hospital \nstay, and postoperative complications. Continuous variables were compared using \nan analysis of variance with significance set at P < .05.\nRESULTS: Visual analog scale pain scores were statistically higher in the LB \ncohort immediately postoperatively in the postanesthesia care unit (7.25 vs. \n1.91; P = .000) as well as for the remainder of postoperative day 0 (4.99 vs. \n3.20; P = .005) but not for the remainder of admission. Opiate consumption was \nsignificantly higher among the LB cohort in the postanesthesia care unit (31.79 \nvs. 7.47; P = .000), on postoperative day 0 (32.64 vs. 15.04; P = .000), and for \nthe total hospital admission (189.50 vs. 91.70, P = .000). Complication numbers \nand length of stay were not statistically different.\nCONCLUSION: Liposomal bupivacaine was not more effective on postoperative pain \nlevels than indwelling interscalene nerve block in patients undergoing shoulder \narthroplasty.",

The primary aim of the present study was \nto report concise 10-year follow-up results.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the 71 patients in the previous randomized \nclinical trial, comparing clinical outcomes, revisions, reoperations, and \nimplant survivorship between the 2-incision and the mini-posterior THAs.\nRESULTS: At the most recent follow-up, the mean Harris hip score was 85 in the \n2-incision group and 87 in the mini-posterior group (P\u0412\u00a0= .4). There were 4 \nrevisions and 2 reoperations (16%) in the 2-incision group vs 1 revision and 3 \nreoperations (11%) in the mini-posterior group (P\u0412\u00a0= .5). Ten-year survivorship \nfree of aseptic revision or reoperation was 77% in the 2-incision group vs 90% \nin the mini-posterior group (P\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a0.15).\nCONCLUSION: There were no improvements in early or midterm clinical outcomes \nwith the 2-incision technique. However, there was a clinical trend toward a \nhigher rate of aseptic revisions in the 2-incision THA group.",

        "abstract": "Background: Although previous studies suggested that bariatric surgery is the most effective and sustainable treatment method for morbid obesity in long term, but without changing in lifestyle, maintaining optimal weight loss is almost impossible.\n\nMethods: Sixty morbid obese patients (BMI \u0456 35) were evaluated before and after 12 weeks of bariatric surgery in order to compare the impact of two different exercise programs on body composition and functional capacity outcomes. Participants were divided into three groups: aerobic (A), aerobic-strength (AS), and control (C) group. Aerobic capacity was assessed with 12-min walk-run test (12MWRT). One-repetition maximum (1RM) test was performed to evaluation upper limb muscle strength. Lower extremity functional capacity was assessed by sit-to-stand test.\n\nResults: Weight, percent body fat (PBF), and fat mass (FM) reduced greater in the trial groups in comparison to the C group (P < 0.05). In the AS group, the reduction of fat-free mass (FFM) was significantly lower than that in the other groups. Mean changes in 12MWRT increased significantly in the intervention groups. The mean change in the sit-to-stand scores was not statistically significant between the three groups. Comparing the intervention groups showed that mean changes in 1RM variables increased in AS group (P = 0.03).\n\nConclusions: The data suggests a positive effect of exercise on weight and PBF decrease after surgery, and it leads to significant improvement on aerobic capacity. Moreover, doing resisted exercise caused greater preserving of lean mass.",

        "abstract": "Background: Although previous studies suggested that bariatric surgery is the most effective and sustainable treatment method for morbid obesity in long term, but without changing in lifestyle, maintaining optimal weight loss is almost impossible.\n\nMethods: Sixty morbid obese patients (BMI \u0456 35) were evaluated before and after 12 weeks of bariatric surgery in order to compare the impact of two different exercise programs on body composition and functional capacity outcomes. Participants were divided into three groups: aerobic (A), aerobic-strength (AS), and control (C) group. The primary outcome was body composition. Secondary outcomes included functional capacity measures. Aerobic capacity was assessed with 12-min walk-run test (12MWRT). One-repetition maximum (1RM) test was performed to evaluation upper limb muscle strength. Lower extremity functional capacity was assessed by sit-to-stand test.\n\nResults: Weight, percent body fat (PBF), and fat mass (FM) reduced greater in the trial groups in comparison to the C group (P < 0.05). In the AS group, the reduction of fat-free mass (FFM) was significantly lower than that in the other groups. Mean changes in 12MWRT increased significantly in the intervention groups. The mean change in the sit-to-stand scores was not statistically significant between the three groups. Comparing the intervention groups showed that mean changes in 1RM variables increased in AS group (P = 0.03).\n\nConclusions: The aerobic and aerobic-strength exercise programs were not more effective than control on the primary outcome of body composition in patients with morbid obesity following bariatric surgery.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Emergency department visits for skin infections in the United States \nhave increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus \n(MRSA). For cellulitis without purulent drainage, \u041e\u0406-hemolytic streptococci are \npresumed to be the predominant pathogens. It is unknown if antimicrobial \nregimens possessing in vitro MRSA activity provide improved outcomes compared \nwith treatments lacking MRSA activity.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine whether cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole \nyields a higher clinical cure rate of uncomplicated cellulitis than cephalexin \nalone.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized \nsuperiority trial in 5 US emergency departments among outpatients older than 12 \nyears with cellulitis and no wound, purulent drainage, or abscess enrolled from \nApril 2009 through June 2012. All participants had soft tissue ultrasound \nperformed at the time of enrollment to exclude abscess. Final follow-up was \nAugust 2012.\nINTERVENTIONS: Cephalexin, 500 mg 4 times daily, plus \ntrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily, for 7 days (n\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030248 \nparticipants) or cephalexin plus placebo for 7 days (n\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030248 participants).\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome determined a priori in the \nper-protocol group was clinical cure, defined as absence of these clinical \nfailure criteria at follow-up visits: fever; increase in erythema (>25%), \nswelling, or tenderness (days 3-4); no decrease in erythema, swelling, or \ntenderness (days 8-10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness \n(days 14-21). A clinically significant difference was defined as greater than \n10%.\nRESULTS: Among 500 randomized participants, 496 (99%) were included in the \nmodified intention-to-treat analysis and 411 (82.2%) in the per-protocol \nanalysis (median age, 40 years [range, 15-78 years]; 58.4% male; 10.9% had \ndiabetes). Median length and width of erythema were 13.0 cm and 10.0 cm. In the \nper-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 182 (83.5%) of 218 \nparticipants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 165 \n(85.5%) of 193 in the cephalexin group (difference, -2.0%; 95% CI, -9.7% to \n5.7%; P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030.50). In the modified intention-to-treat population, clinical cure \noccurred in 189 (76.2%) of 248 participants in the cephalexin plus \ntrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 171 (69.0%) of 248 in the cephalexin \ngroup (difference, 7.3%; 95% CI, -1.0% to 15.5%; P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030.07). Between-group adverse \nevent rates and secondary outcomes through 7 to 9 weeks, including overnight \nhospitalization, recurrent skin infections, and similar infection in household \ncontacts, did not differ significantly.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with uncomplicated cellulitis, the use \nof cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared to cephalexin alone \ndid not result in higher rates of clinical resolution of cellulitis in the \nper-protocol analysis. However, because imprecision around the findings in the \nmodified intention-to-treat analysis included a clinically important difference \nfavoring cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, further research may be \nneeded.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Emergency department visits for skin infections in the United States \nhave increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus \n(MRSA). For cellulitis without purulent drainage, \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci are \npresumed to be the predominant pathogens. It is unknown if antimicrobial \nregimens possessing in vitro MRSA activity provide improved outcomes compared \nwith treatments lacking MRSA activity.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine whether cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole \nyields a higher clinical cure rate of uncomplicated cellulitis than cephalexin \nalone.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized \nsuperiority trial in 5 US emergency departments among outpatients older than 12 \nyears with cellulitis and no wound, purulent drainage, or abscess enrolled from \nApril 2009 through June 2012. All participants had soft tissue ultrasound \nperformed at the time of enrollment to exclude abscess. Final follow-up was \nAugust 2012.\nINTERVENTIONS: Cephalexin, 500 mg 4 times daily, plus \ntrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily, for 7 days (n = 248 \nparticipants) or cephalexin plus placebo for 7 days (n = 248 participants).\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome determined a priori in the \nper-protocol group was clinical cure, defined as absence of these clinical \nfailure criteria at follow-up visits: fever; increase in erythema (>25%), \nswelling, or tenderness (days 3-4); no decrease in erythema, swelling, or \ntenderness (days 8-10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness \n(days 14-21). A clinically significant difference was defined as greater than \n10%.\nRESULTS: Among 500 randomized participants, 496 (99%) were included in the \nmodified intention-to-treat analysis and 411 (82.2%) in the per-protocol \nanalysis (median age, 40 years [range, 15-78 years]; 58.4% male; 10.9% had \ndiabetes). Median length and width of erythema were 13.0 cm and 10.0 cm. In the \nper-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 182 (83.5%) of 218 \nparticipants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 165 \n(85.5%) of 193 in the cephalexin group (difference, -2.0%; 95% CI, -9.7% to \n5.7%; P = .50). Between-group adverse event rates and secondary outcomes through \n7 to 9 weeks, including overnight hospitalization, recurrent skin infections, \nand similar infection in household contacts, did not differ significantly.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was not \nmore effective than cephalexin alone in patients with uncomplicated cellulitis.",

We hypothesized that \nthe addition of acetaminophen to a multimodal analgesia regimen would provide \nimproved pain management in patients after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and \nthat the effect of acetaminophen would be variable based on the route of \ndelivery.\nMETHODS: The study was a single-center, randomized, double-blinded, \nplacebo-controlled clinical trial on the efficacy of IV vs oral acetaminophen in \npatients undergoing unilateral TKA. One hundred seventy-four subjects were \nrandomized to one of the 3 groups: IV acetaminophen group (IV group, n = 57) \nreceived 1 g IV acetaminophen and oral placebo before postanesthesia care unit \n(PACU) admission; oral acetaminophen group (PO group, n = 58) received 1 g oral \nacetaminophen and volume-matched IV normal saline; placebo group (Placebo group, \nn = 59) received oral placebo and volume-matched IV normal saline. The primary \noutcome was average PACU pain scores. Secondary outcomes included maximum pain \nscore, pain scores before physical therapy, total opiate consumption, time to \nPACU discharge, time to rescue analgesia, and time to breakthrough pain.\nRESULTS: The average PACU pain score was 0.56 \u00b1 0.99 (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) \nin the IV group compared with 0.67 \u00b1 1.20 in the PO group (P = .84) and 0.58 \u00b1 \n0.99 in the Placebo group (P = .71).

No significant \ndifference was seen between internal and external cooling in terms of survival, \nneurological outcomes and complications. In the internal cooling arm, there was \nlower risk of developing overcooling (p=0.01) and rebound hyperthermia (p=0.02). \nCompared to normothermia, internal cooling had higher survival (OR=3.36, 95% \nCI=(1.130, 10.412), and lower risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias (OR=0.18, \n95% CI=(0.04, 0.63)).

Intervention compliance was inversely \ncorrelated to change in %BMIp95 during the Intensive Phase (P\u0432\u0402\u2030<\u0432\u0402\u20300.05). In the \nTransition Phase, %BMIp95 was maintained or rebounded in both programs \n(P\u0432\u0402\u2030<\u0432\u0402\u20300.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: MEND/CATCH6-12 was more efficacious for BMI reduction at 3 months \nbut not 12 months compared to Next Steps in underserved children. Intervention \ncompliance influenced outcomes, emphasizing the need for research in sustaining \nfamily engagement in low-income populations.",

Three hundred \nfifty-five adult, unconscious patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were \nenrolled from February 16, 2013, to June 1, 2016, with final follow-up on \nDecember 27, 2016.\nINTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to TTM (33\u0432\u0402\u2030\u0412\u00b1\u0432\u0402\u20301\u0412\u00b0C) for 48 hours (n\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030176) \nor 24 hours (n\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030179), followed by gradual rewarming of 0.5\u0412\u00b0C per hour until \nreaching 37\u0412\u00b0C.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was 6-month neurologic outcome, \nwith a Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) score of 1 or 2 used to define \nfavorable outcome. Secondary outcomes included 6-month mortality, including time \nto death, the occurrence of adverse events, and intensive care unit resource \nuse.\nRESULTS: In 355 patients who were randomized (mean age, 60 years; 295 [83%] \nmen), 351 (99%) completed the trial. Of these patients, 69% (120/175) in the \n48-hour group had a favorable outcome at 6 months compared with 64% (112/176) in \nthe 24-hour group (difference, 4.9%; 95% CI, -5% to 14.8%; relative risk [RR], \n1.08; 95% CI, 0.93-1.25; P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030.33). Six-month mortality was 27% (48/175) in the \n48-hour group and 34% (60/177) in the 24-hour group (difference, -6.5%; 95% CI, \n-16.1% to 3.1%; RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.59-1.11; P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030.19). There was no significant \ndifference in the time to mortality between the 48-hour group and the 24-hour \ngroup (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.54-1.15; P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030.22). Adverse events were more \ncommon in the 48-hour group (97%) than in the 24-hour group (91%) (difference, \n5.6%; 95% CI, 0.6%-10.6%; RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.12; P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030.04). The median \nlength of intensive care unit stay (151 vs 117 hours; P\u0432\u0402\u2030<\u0432\u0402\u2030.001), but not \nhospital stay (11 vs 12 days; P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030.50), was longer in the 48-hour group than in \nthe 24-hour group.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In unconscious survivors from out-of-hospital cardiac \narrest admitted to the ICU, targeted temperature management at 33\u0412\u00b0C for 48 hours \ndid not significantly improve 6-month neurologic outcome compared with targeted \ntemperature management at 33\u0412\u00b0C for 24 hours.

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: International resuscitation guidelines recommend targeted \ntemperature management (TTM) at 33\u00b0C to 36\u00b0C in unconscious patients with \nout-of-hospital cardiac arrest for at least 24 hours, but the optimal duration \nof TTM is uncertain.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine whether TTM at 33\u00b0C for 48 hours results in better \nneurologic outcomes compared with currently recommended, standard, 24-hour TTM.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was an international, \ninvestigator-initiated, blinded-outcome-assessor, parallel, pragmatic, \nmulticenter, randomized clinical superiority trial in 10 intensive care units \n(ICUs) at 10 university hospitals in 6 European countries. Three hundred \nfifty-five adult, unconscious patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were \nenrolled from February 16, 2013, to June 1, 2016, with final follow-up on \nDecember 27, 2016.\nINTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to TTM (33 \u00b1 1\u00b0C) for 48 hours (n = 176) \nor 24 hours (n = 179), followed by gradual rewarming of 0.5\u00b0C per hour until \nreaching 37\u00b0C.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was 6-month neurologic outcome, \nwith a Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) score of 1 or 2 used to define \nfavorable outcome. Secondary outcomes included 6-month mortality, including time \nto death, the occurrence of adverse events, and intensive care unit resource \nuse.\nRESULTS: In 355 patients who were randomized (mean age, 60 years; 295 [83%] \nmen), 351 (99%) completed the trial. Of these patients, 120/175 (69%) in the \n48-hour group had a favorable outcome at 6 months compared with 112/176 (64%) in \nthe 24-hour group (difference, 4.9%; 95% CI, -5% to 14.8%; relative risk [RR], \n1.08; 95% CI, 0.93-1.25; P = .33). Six-month mortality was 48/175 (27%) in the \n48-hour group and 60/177 (34%) in the 24-hour group (difference, -6.5%; 95% CI, \n-16.1% to 3.1%; RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.59-1.11; P = .19). Time to mortality \nbetween the 48-hour group and the 24-hour group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, \n0.54-1.15; P = .22). Adverse events occurred in 97% of the 48-hour group and 91% \nof the 24-hour group (difference, 5.6%; 95% CI, 0.6%-10.6%; RR, 1.06; 95% CI, \n1.01-1.12; P = .04). The median length of intensive care unit stay was 151 hours \nin the 48-hour group versus 117 hours in the 24-hour group (P < .001), and \nhospital stay was 11 versus 12 days (P = .50).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Targeted temperature management at 33\u00b0C for 48 hours \nwas not more effective on 6-month neurologic outcome than targeted temperature \nmanagement at 33\u00b0C for 24 hours in unconscious survivors from out-of-hospital \ncardiac arrest admitted to the ICU.",

A total \nof 55 patients (91.7%) underwent a clinical review and magnetic resonance \nimaging (MRI) at a mean of 3.5 years after surgery (range, 36-51 months). \nPatient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) included the Constant score, Quick \nDisabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH) questionnaire, Oxford \nShoulder Score (OSS), and visual analog scale (VAS) for pain. Global rating of \nchange (GRC) scale and patient satisfaction scores were evaluated. Structural \nintegrity of the surgical repair was assessed via MRI using the Sugaya \nclassification system.\nRESULTS: At the midterm review, there was no difference between the groups for \nany of the PROMs. No differences between the groups were demonstrated for the \nsubjective and range of motion subscales of the Constant score. The Constant \nstrength subscale score was higher in the PRP group (3.3 points; 95% CI, 1.0-5.7; \nP = .006). There was no evidence for any group differences in MRI scores or retear \nrates, with 66.7% of PRP patients and 64.3% of control patients rated as Sugaya \ngrade 1. Two control patients had symptomatic retears (both full thickness) within \nthe first 16 weeks after surgery compared with 2 PRP patients, who suffered \nsymptomatic retears (both partial thickness) between 16 weeks and a mean 3.5-year \nfollow-up.\nCONCLUSION: PRP was not more effective than control in improving clinical and \nradiographic outcomes in patients undergoing arthroscopic supraspinatus repair.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been applied as an adjunct to rotator \ncuff repair to improve tendon-bone healing and potentially reduce the incidence \nof subsequent tendon retears.\nPURPOSE: To investigate whether the midterm clinical and radiographic outcomes \nof arthroscopic supraspinatus repair are enhanced after repeated postoperative \napplications of PRP.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\nMETHODS: A total of 60 patients (30 control; 30 PRP) were initially randomized \nto receive 2 ultrasound-guided injections of PRP to the tendon repair site at 7 \nand 14 days after double-row arthroscopic supraspinatus repair or not. A total \nof 55 patients (91.7%) underwent a clinical review and magnetic resonance \nimaging (MRI) at a mean of 3.5 years after surgery (range, 36-51 months). \nPatient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) included the Constant score, Quick \nDisabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH) questionnaire, Oxford \nShoulder Score (OSS), and visual analog scale (VAS) for pain. Global rating of \nchange (GRC) scale and patient satisfaction scores were evaluated. Structural \nintegrity of the surgical repair was assessed via MRI using the Sugaya \nclassification system.\nRESULTS: At the midterm review, there was no difference between the groups for \nany of the PROMs. No differences between the groups were demonstrated for the \nsubjective and range of motion subscales of the Constant score, although a \nsignificantly higher Constant strength subscale score was observed in the PRP \ngroup (3.3 points; 95% CI, 1.0-5.7; P = .006). There was no evidence for any \ngroup differences in MRI scores or retear rates, with 66.7% of PRP patients and \n64.3% of control patients rated as Sugaya grade 1. Two control patients had \nsymptomatic retears (both full thickness) within the first 16 weeks after \nsurgery compared with 2 PRP patients, who suffered symptomatic retears (both \npartial thickness) between 16 weeks and a mean 3.5-year follow-up.\nCONCLUSION: Significant postoperative clinical improvements and high levels of \npatient satisfaction were observed in patients at the midterm review after \nsupraspinatus repair. While pain-free, maximal abduction strength was greater in \nthe midterm after PRP treatment, repeated applications of PRP delivered at 7 and \n14 days after surgery provided no additional benefit to tendon integrity.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Shoulder arthroplasty is the fastest growing joint replacement \nsurgery in the United States, and optimal postoperative pain management is \ncritical to optimize outcomes for these surgeries. Liposomal bupivacaine (LB) \nhas gained popularity for its potential to provide extended postoperative pain \nrelief with possibly fewer side effects. The goal of this study was to assess \nthe impact of LB compared with continuous interscalene nerve block (CISB) in \nterms of postoperative pain control after shoulder arthroplasty surgery.\nMETHODS: A prospective randomized controlled clinical trial compared consecutive \npatients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty treated with CISB vs. LB with a single \nbolus interscalene block. The primary outcome measures included pain assessment \nup to 24 hours after surgery; in addition, all doses and times of narcotics \nadministered during the inpatient stay were recorded. Patient-reported outcome \nmeasures for pain, satisfaction, and functional outcomes were recorded \npostoperatively.\nRESULTS: A total of 70 of 74 consecutive patients who underwent shoulder \narthroplasty were included in the study. The LB group had equivalent narcotic \nuse, pain scores, and time to first narcotic rescue compared with the CISB group \nwithin the first 24 hours (P > .05). The LB group had higher American Shoulder \nand Elbow Surgeons score and Penn Shoulder Score at final follow-up. There was \nan increased number of complications and cost for the CISB group.\nCONCLUSION: Liposomal bupivacaine was not more effective on pain control than \ncontinuous interscalene nerve block in patients with shoulder arthroplasty.",

Randomization was by minimization (age and \nethnicity), with participants assigned to an intense intervention group \n(home-based assessments at 6-month intervals and a 12-month multidisciplinary \nprogram with weekly group sessions) or to a minimal-intensity control group with \nhome-based assessments and advice at each 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome \nwas the change in BMI standard deviation score (SDS) at 12 months from baseline. \nA mixed model analysis was undertaken, incorporating all 6- and 12-month data.\nRESULTS: Two hundred and three children were randomly assigned (47% M\u0414\u0403ori, 43% \nNew Zealand European, 53% female, 28% from the most deprived quintile, mean age \n10.7 years, mean BMI SDS 3.12). Both groups displayed a change in BMI SDS at 12 \nmonths from baseline (-0.12 control, -0.10 intervention), improvements in \ncardiovascular fitness (P\u0432\u0402\u2030<\u0432\u0402\u20300.0001), and improvements in quality of life \n(P\u0432\u0402\u2030<\u0432\u0402\u20300.001). Achieving\u0432\u0402\u2030\u0432\u2030\u0490\u0432\u0402\u203070% attendance in the intense intervention group \nresulted in a change in BMI SDS of -0.22.\nCONCLUSIONS: This program achieved a high recruitment of target groups and a \nhigh rate of BMI SDS reduction, irrespective of intervention intensity. If \nretention is optimized, the intensive program doubles its effect.",

The primary outcome was the number of \ndiarrhoea and vomiting episodes during the 24 hours following treatment. \nSecondary outcomes included the number of days with symptoms. Pathogens in \nfaeces were diagnosed by real-time PCR.\nRESULTS: The number of diarrhoea and vomiting episodes during the 24 hours \nfollowing treatment was not significantly different between ondansetron and \nplacebo groups. One dose of oral ondansetron reduced duration of rotavirus \nclinical symptoms (p = 0.014), with a median of two days.

Forty-one women were randomized to a 6-month intervention: \ntelemedicine with Wi-Fi scales, text messaging (texting), or enhanced usual care \n(EUC). The primary outcome was weight loss. Changes in anthropometrics and \npsychosocial measures were analyzed.\nRESULTS: One-third of survey participants lacked awareness that obesity \nincreased the risk of EC, and 40% misclassified their body mass. There were no \nsignificant differences in weight loss across interventions (mean = -4.4 kg, \nSD = 6.5 kg). Telemedicine showed improvements in physical health and \ncancer-related body image (Ps = 0.04) compared to texting and in sexual \nfunctioning compared to EUC (P = 0.03). Total physical activity was increased in \nEUC compared with telemedicine (P = 0.01), and vigorous physical activity was \nincreased in EUC compared with both interventions (P = 0.01-0.03); walking \nsignificantly increased in texting compared with telemedicine (P = 0.02).\nCONCLUSIONS: Technology-based interventions were not more effective than \nenhanced usual care for weight loss in EC survivors with obesity.",

Forty-one women were randomized to a 6-month intervention: \ntelemedicine with Wi-Fi scales, text messaging (texting), or enhanced usual care \n(EUC). Changes in anthropometrics and psychosocial measures were analyzed.\nRESULTS: One-third of survey participants lacked awareness that obesity \nincreased the risk of EC, and 40% misclassified their body mass. There were no \nsignificant differences in weight loss across interventions (mean\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030-4.4 kg, \nSD\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u20306.5 kg). Telemedicine showed improvements in physical health and \ncancer-related body image (Ps\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u20300.04) compared to texting and in sexual \nfunctioning compared to EUC (P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u20300.03). Total physical activity was increased in \nEUC compared with telemedicine (P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u20300.01), and vigorous physical activity was \nincreased in EUC compared with both interventions (P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u20300.01-0.03); walking \nsignificantly increased in texting compared with telemedicine (P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u20300.02).\nCONCLUSIONS: Technology-based lifestyle interventions in EC survivors with \nobesity were accessible and resulted in weight loss and improved quality of \nlife. EUC also produced weight loss, demonstrating a potential for beginning \nweight management with information on specific diet and exercise goals.",

Participants completed a 4-week smartphone headache diary at baseline, posttreatment (16-20 wk), and follow-up (32-36 wk). The primary outcome was posttreatment change in migraine days per month, analyzed via linear mixed effects models.\n\nResults: Of 110 participants randomly assigned, 85 (78%) and 80 (73%) completed posttreatment and follow-up. The BWL group achieved greater weight loss (mean [95% CI] in kilograms) than the ME group at posttreatment (-3.8 [-2.5 to -5.0] vs. + 0.9 [-0.4 to 2.2], P < 0.001) and follow-up (-3.2 [-2.0 to -4.5] vs. + 1.1 [-0.2 to 2.4], P < 0.001). There were no significant group (BWL vs. ME) differences (mean [95% CI]) in migraine days per month at posttreatment (-3.0 [-2.0 to -4.0] vs. -4.0 [-2.9 to -5.0], P = 0.185) or follow-up (-3.8 [-2.7 to -4.8] vs. -4.4 [-3.4 to -5.5], P = 0.378).\n\nConclusions: BWL was not more effective than ME on migraine days per month in women with comorbid migraine and overweight or obesity.",

        "abstract": "Objective: The objective of this study was to test whether behavioral weight loss (BWL) intervention decreases headaches in women with comorbid migraine and overweight or obesity.\n\nMethods: This randomized, single-blind trial allocated women 18 to 50 years old with 4 to 20 migraine days per month and a BMI = 25.0-49.9 kg/m2 to 16 weeks of BWL (n = 54), which targeted exercise and eating behaviors for weight loss, or to migraine education control (ME, n = 56), which delivered didactic instruction on migraine and treatments. Participants completed a 4-week smartphone headache diary at baseline, posttreatment (16-20 wk), and follow-up (32-36 wk). The primary outcome was posttreatment change in migraine days per month, analyzed via linear mixed effects models.\n\nResults: Of 110 participants randomly assigned, 85 (78%) and 80 (73%) completed posttreatment and follow-up. Although the BWL group achieved greater weight loss (mean [95% CI] in kilograms) than the ME group at posttreatment (-3.8 [-2.5 to -5.0] vs. + 0.9 [-0.4 to 2.2], P < 0.001) and follow-up (-3.2 [-2.0 to -4.5] vs. + 1.1 [-0.2 to 2.4], P < 0.001), there were no significant group (BWL vs. ME) differences (mean [95% CI]) in migraine days per month at posttreatment (-3.0 [-2.0 to -4.0] vs. -4.0 [-2.9 to -5.0], P = 0.185) or follow-up (-3.8 [-2.7 to -4.8] vs. -4.4 [-3.4 to -5.5], P = 0.378).\n\nConclusions: Contrary to hypotheses, BWL and ME yielded similar, sustained reductions in migraine headaches. Future research should evaluate whether adding BWL to standard pharmacological and/or nonpharmacological migraine treatment approaches yields greater benefits.",

A \ncomparative analysis showed no significant intergroup difference in any of the \nclinical scores at any follow-up point. The median duration of patient \nsubjective perception of symptomatic relief was 9 months for HA and 12 months \nfor PRP (not significant). The only significant difference was observed in the \nrate of reintervention at 24 months, which was significantly lower in the PRP \ngroup (22.6% vs 37.1%, P = .036).\nCONCLUSION: Both treatments were effective in improving knee functional status \nand symptoms over time. PRP did not provide an overall superior clinical \nimprovement compared with HA in terms of either symptomatic-functional \nimprovement at different follow-up points or effect duration.\nREGISTRATION: NCT01670578 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier).",

Randomized \ncontrolled trials comparing LP- or LR-PRP with a control alongside ARCR were \nincluded. Clinical outcomes, including retears and functional outcomes, were \ncompared using a frequentist approach to network meta-analysis, with statistical \nanalysis performed using R. The treatment options were ranked using the P-score.\nRESULTS: There were 13 studies (868 patients) included, with 9 studies comparing \nLP-PRP with a control and 4 studies comparing LR-PRP with a control. LP-PRP was \nfound to significantly reduce the rate of retear and/or incomplete tendon \nhealing after fixation, even among medium-large tears; it also improved outcomes \non the visual analog scale for pain, Constant score, and University of \nCalifornia Los Angeles score. LP-PRP had the highest P-score for all treatment \ngroups. LR-PRP did not result in any significant improvements over the control \ngroup, except for visual analog scale score for pain. However, post hoc analysis \nrevealed that LP-PRP did not lead to significant improvements over LR-PRP in any \ncategory.\nCONCLUSION: The current study demonstrates that LP-PRP reduces the rate of \nretear and/or incomplete tendon healing after ARCR and improves patient-reported \noutcomes as compared with a control. However, it is still unclear whether LP-PRP \nimproves the tendon healing rate when compared with LR-PRP.",

Severe obesity is considered a state of meta-inflammation \nassociated with obesity that influences the development of chronic-degenerative \ndiseases.\nOBJECTIVE: We aimed to establish the immunometabolic differences in bariatric \npatients and to determine whether cellular immunity is associated with metabolic \nchanges.\nMETHODOLOGY: We conducted an observational study in patients who underwent \nlaparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass \n(LRYGB). We explored the differences in the immunometabolic profile before and \nafter surgery in the study group, by surgical technique, and we evaluated the \nchanges in immunological variables as a function of metabolic variables with \ncorrelation analysis.\nRESULTS: The follow-up rate was 88.7%. After the intervention, there were \nchanges in cellular immunity, with a decrease in effector T lymphocytes \n(CD8+CD28-) and an increase in B lymphocytes, memory helper T cells, and \ncytotoxic T lymphocytes. LSG resulted in a decrease in (CD4+CD62-) T \nlymphocytes compared with LRYGB. Patients who underwent surgery with LRYGB \nshowed clinical and metabolic changes, as well as changes in obesity-associated \nmedical problems. Women who underwent LRYGB showed a reduction in fat-free mass \ncompared with women who underwent LSG.\nCONCLUSION: Bariatric surgery leads to immunometabolic changes in patients with \nsevere obesity.",
