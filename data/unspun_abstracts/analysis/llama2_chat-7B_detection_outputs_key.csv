18237696,Prospective randomized comparison of anatomic single- and double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy",  Focus on (+) secondary endpoint,,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Purpose
To determine if anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is superior to anatomic single-bundle reconstruction in restoring the stabilities and functions of the knee joint.
Methods
A prospective randomized clinical study was done to compare the results of 32 cases of anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction and 34 cases of anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction with average follow-up of 16.3 В± 3.1В months. Tunnel placements of all the cases were measured on 3D CT. Clinical results were collected after reconstruction; graft's appearance, meniscus status and cartilage state under arthroscopy were compared and analysed too.
Results
Tunnel placements, confirmed with 3D CT, were in the anatomic positions as described in literature both in SB and DB group. No differences were found between SB and DB groups in clinical outcome scores, pivot shift test and KT 1000В measurements (average side-to-side difference for anterior tibial translation was 0.7В mm in SB group and 1.0В mm in DB group). More than 70 % of the single-bundle graft and AM bundle graft in DB group appeared excellent, but only 44.1 % of PL bundle grafts in DB group were excellent and 11.8 % were in poor state. No new menisci tear was found either in SB or DB group, however, in DB group cartilage damages in medial patella-femoral joint occurred in 38.2 % cases. This rate was significantly higher than in the SB group which is only 9.3 %.
Conclusion
Both single- and double-bundle anatomic ACL reconstruction can restore the knee's stability and functions very well. However, more incidences of poor PL status and medial patellar-femoral cartilage damage may occur in double-bundle ACL reconstruction.",no_spin, Yes,yes,"[{'token': 29871, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -4.95898348162882e-05, 'probability': 0.9999504089355469}, {'token': 3869, 'token_string': 'Yes', 'logits': -0.0006983225466683507, 'probability': 0.9993018507957458}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.353221595287323, 'probability': 0.7024214863777161}]"

dextrose in normal saline solution compared with normal saline solution will 
lead to a lower proportion of hospitalized patients and a greater reduction in 
serum ketone levels in children with gastroenteritis and dehydration.
METHODS: We enrolled children aged 6 months to 6 years in a double-blind, 
randomized controlled trial of patients presenting to a pediatric emergency 
department. Subjects were randomized to receive a 20 mL/kg infusion of either 5% 
dextrose in normal saline solution or normal saline solution. Serum ketone 
levels were measured before and at 1- and 2-hour intervals after the initial

RESULTS: One hundred eighty-eight children were enrolled. The proportion of 
children hospitalized did not differ between groups (35% in the 5% dextrose in 
normal saline solution group versus 44% in the normal saline solution group;

randomized clinical trial, to our knowledge. We explore various efficacy 
measures for a novel F(ab)2 antivenom in patients with moderate to severe pain 
caused by black widow spider envenomation.
METHODS: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, clinical trial was 
conducted in 12 academic emergency departments. We included patients at least 10 
years old with moderate to severe latrodectism. Subjects received either a 
single intravenous infusion of antivenom or placebo. Pain was assessed with the 
visual analog scale. The primary efficacy outcome was the difference in pre- and

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of the two procedures in patients older than 55 years of age affected by reparable rotator cuff tears with concomitant long head biceps pathologies.

Methods: Patients older than 55 years of age with long head biceps lesions and reparable rotator cuff tears were selected for this study. A total of 151 patients were randomly assigned to the tenotomy group (77 patients) or the tenodesis group (74 patients). Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was performed in all the patients. Before surgery, physical and radiological examinations were performed; the constant score was measured as well.

Results: Patients were followed for an average of 24 months.

However, there are unanswered questions about the performance of hemiarthroplasty over the longer term compared with internal fixation.

Questions/purposes: We sought to compare hemiarthroplasty with internal fixation in terms of (1) outcomes scores for pain, hip function, and quality of life at a minimum of 5 years after surgery in a randomized trial. A secondary purpose was to compare (2) patient survival and (3) frequency of reoperation in the two groups.

Methods: A total of 222 consecutive patients older than 60 years, including those cognitively impaired, with FNF were randomized to either internal fixation with two parallel screws or bipolar hemiarthroplasty. At a minimum followup of 4.9 years (mean, 5.9 years; range, 4.9-7.2 years), 68 of the 70 surviving patients were examined by a study nurse and study physiotherapist blinded to initial treatment.

24136801,The effect of infrapatellar fat pad excision on complications after minimally invasive TKA: a randomized controlled trial.,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,,Claim benefit based on (+) secondary endpoint,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Background: The infrapatellar fat pad is one of the structures that obscures exposure in minimally invasive total knee arthroplasty (MIS TKA). Most MIS TKA surgeons (and many surgeons who use other approaches as well) excise the fat pad for better exposure of the knee. There is still controversy about the result of fat pad excision on patella baja, pain, and function.

Questions/purposes: In the setting of a randomized controlled trial, we sought to determine whether infrapatellar fat pad excision during MIS TKA causes (1) patellar tendon shortening (as measured by patella baja); (2) increased anterior knee pain; (3) decreases in the Knee Society Score or functional subscore; or (4) more patella-related complications.

Methods: We randomized 90 patients undergoing MIS TKA at one institution into two groups. In one group, 45 patients underwent MIS TKA with complete infrapatellar fat pad excision and in the other group, 45 patients received MIS TKA without infrapatellar fat pad excision. The patella was selectively resurfaced in these patients; there was no difference between the groups in terms of the percentage of patients whose patellae were resurfaced. We measured patellar tendon shortening, knee flexion, anterior knee pain, Knee Society Score (KSS), functional subscore, and patellar complications at preoperative and postoperative periods of 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year; complete followup data were available on 86% of patients (77 of 90) who were enrolled.

Results: At the final followup, no significant differences were observed in patellar tendon shortening, KSS, functional subscore, or knee flexion in either group.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We compared the side effect profile, analgesic efficacy, and 
functional recovery between patients receiving a continuous intraarticular 
infusion of ropivacaine and patients receiving an epidural plus femoral nerve 
block (FNB) after TKA.
METHODS: Ninety-four patients undergoing unilateral TKA were prospectively 
randomized to receive a spinal-epidural analgesic infusion plus a 
single-injection FNB or a spinal anesthetic plus a continuous postoperative 
intraarticular infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine. All patients were blinded to their

disruptive to patients and families, and associated with considerable cost to 
the health service. Improved patient experience and cost reductions could be 
realised by providing cost-effective crisis planning services.
METHODS: Economic evaluation within a multi-centre randomised controlled trial 
comparing Joint Crisis Plans (JCP) plus treatment as usual (TAU) to TAU alone 
for patients aged over 16, with at least one psychiatric hospital admission in 
the previous two years and on the Enhanced Care Programme Approach register. 
JCPs, containing the patient's treatment preferences for any future psychiatric 
emergency, are a form of crisis intervention that aim to mitigate the negative 
consequences of relapse, including hospital admission and use of coercion. Data 
were collected at baseline and 18-months after randomisation. The primary 
outcome was admission to hospital under the Mental Health Act. The economic 
evaluation took a service perspective (health, social care and criminal justice 
services) and a societal perspective (additionally including criminal activity 
and productivity losses).
FINDINGS: The addition of JCPs to TAU had no significant effect on compulsory 
admissions or total societal cost per participant over 18-months follow-up. From

disruptive to patients and families, and associated with considerable cost to 
the health service. Improved patient experience and cost reductions could be 
realised by providing cost-effective crisis planning services.
METHODS: Economic evaluation within a multi-centre randomised controlled trial 
comparing Joint Crisis Plans (JCP) plus treatment as usual (TAU) to TAU alone 
for patients aged over 16, with at least one psychiatric hospital admission in 
the previous two years and on the Enhanced Care Programme Approach register. 
JCPs, containing the patient's treatment preferences for any future psychiatric 
emergency, are a form of crisis intervention that aim to mitigate the negative 
consequences of relapse, including hospital admission and use of coercion. Data 
were collected at baseline and 18-months after randomisation. The primary 
outcome was admission to hospital under the Mental Health Act. The economic 
evaluation took a service perspective (health, social care and criminal justice 
services) and a societal perspective (additionally including criminal activity 
and productivity losses).
FINDINGS: The addition of JCPs to TAU had no significant effect on compulsory 
admissions or total societal cost per participant over 18-months follow-up. From 
the service cost perspective, however, evidence suggests a higher probability 
(80%) of JCPs being the more cost-effective option. Exploration by ethnic group 
highlights distinct patterns of costs and effects. Whilst the evidence does not 
support the cost-effectiveness of JCPs for White or Asian ethnic groups, there 
is at least a 90% probability of the JCP intervention being the more 
cost-effective option in the Black ethnic group.
INTERPRETATION: The results by ethnic group are sufficiently striking to warrant 
further investigation into the potential for patient gain from JCPs among black 
patient groups.",no_spin, Yes,yes,"[{'token': 29871, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -2.682172998902388e-05, 'probability': 0.9999731183052063}, {'token': 3869, 'token_string': 'Yes', 'logits': -0.0005316513124853373, 'probability': 0.9994685053825378}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.3871697187423706, 'probability': 0.6789758205413818}]"

Methods: Between January 2007 and January 2011, 87 patients who underwent arthroscopic Bankart repair with the use of knot-tying suture anchors or knotless suture anchors were evaluated, with 45 patients in the knot-tying suture group and 42 patients in the knotless group. Patients were assigned to either group, with odd-numbered patients going to the knot-tying suture arm and even-numbered patients assigned to the knotless arm. Outcomes included the Constant score, the visual analog scale (VAS) score, patient satisfaction score, and range of motion in forward flexion and external rotation with the arm in adduction. Redislocations or subluxations with the 2 techniques was also studied.

Results: Both groups showed a statistically significant improvement between the preoperative and postoperative VAS scores and Constant scores. In the knot-tying suture group, the VAS score improved from 2.5 ± 2.3 to 0.7 ± 0.5 (P < .05) and the Constant score improved from 64 ± 7 to 92 ± 10 (P < .05).

Questions/purposes: We performed a randomized controlled trial to compare the (1) frequency of recurrent instability and (2) disease-specific quality-of-life scores after treatment of first-time shoulder dislocation using either immobilization in external rotation or immobilization in internal rotation in a group of young patients.

Methods: Sixty patients younger than 35 years of age with primary, traumatic, anterior shoulder dislocations were randomized (concealed, computer-generated) to immobilization with either an internal rotation sling (n = 29) or an external rotation brace (n = 31) at a mean of 4 days after closed reduction (range, 1-7 days).

placebo for adults with undifferentiated emergency department (ED) nausea and 
vomiting.
METHODS: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was 
conducted in 2 metropolitan EDs in Melbourne, Australia. Eligible patients with 
ED nausea and vomiting were randomized to receive 4 mg intravenous ondansetron, 
20 mg intravenous metoclopramide, or saline solution placebo. Primary outcome 
was mean change in visual analog scale (VAS) rating of nausea severity from 
enrollment to 30 minutes after study drug administration. Secondary outcomes 
included patient satisfaction, need for rescue antiemetic treatment, and adverse 
events.
RESULTS: Of 270 recruited patients, 258 (95.6%) were available for analysis. Of 
these patients, 87 (33.7%) received ondansetron; 88 (34.1%), metoclopramide; and 
83 (32.2%), placebo. Baseline characteristics between treatment groups and 
recruitment site were similar. Mean decrease in VAS score was 27 mm (95% 
confidence interval [CI] 22 to 33 mm) for ondansetron, 28 mm (95% CI 22 to 34 
mm) for metoclopramide, and 23 mm (95% CI 16 to 30 mm) for placebo. Satisfaction 
with treatment was reported by 54.1% (95% CI 43.5% to 64.5%), 61.6% (95% CI 
51.0% to 71.4%), and 59.5% (95% CI 48.4% to 69.9%) for ondansetron, 
metoclopramide, and placebo, respectively; rescue medication was required by 
34.5% (95% CI 25.0% to 45.1%), 17.9% (95% CI 10.8% to 27.2%), and 36.3% (95% CI

CONCLUSION: Reductions in nausea severity for this adult ED nausea and vomiting 
population were similar for 4 mg intravenous ondansetron, 20 mg intravenous

placebo for adults with undifferentiated emergency department (ED) nausea and 
vomiting.
METHODS: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was 
conducted in 2 metropolitan EDs in Melbourne, Australia. Eligible patients with 
ED nausea and vomiting were randomized to receive 4 mg intravenous ondansetron, 
20 mg intravenous metoclopramide, or saline solution placebo. Primary outcome 
was mean change in visual analog scale (VAS) rating of nausea severity from 
enrollment to 30 minutes after study drug administration. Secondary outcomes 
included patient satisfaction, need for rescue antiemetic treatment, and adverse 
events.
RESULTS: Of 270 recruited patients, 258 (95.6%) were available for analysis. Of 
these patients, 87 (33.7%) received ondansetron; 88 (34.1%), metoclopramide; and 
83 (32.2%), placebo. Baseline characteristics between treatment groups and 
recruitment site were similar. Mean decrease in VAS score was 27 mm (95% 
confidence interval [CI] 22 to 33 mm) for ondansetron, 28 mm (95% CI 22 to 34 
mm) for metoclopramide, and 23 mm (95% CI 16 to 30 mm) for placebo. Satisfaction 
with treatment was reported by 54.1% (95% CI 43.5% to 64.5%), 61.6% (95% CI 
51.0% to 71.4%), and 59.5% (95% CI 48.4% to 69.9%) for ondansetron,

kinetic chain resistance training on anterior knee laxity and function in the 
ACL-injured (ACLI) knee.
METHODS: Fifty-eight ACLI subjects were randomised to one of three (12-week 
duration) training groups. The STAND group trained according to a standardised 
rehabilitation protocol. Subjects in the LOW and HIGH group trained as did the 
STAND group but with the addition of seated knee extensor open kinetic chain 
resistance training at loads of 2 sets of 20 repetition maximum (RM) and 20 sets

RESULTS: The LOW group demonstrated a reduction in 133 N anterior knee laxity

navigation enables intraoperative control of leg length equalization and offset 
reconstruction. However, the effect of navigation compared with intraoperative 
fluoroscopy is unclear.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether intraoperative use of imageless navigation 
(1) improves the relative accuracy of leg length and global and femoral offset 
restoration; (2) increases the absolute precision of leg length and global and 
femoral offset equalization; and (3) reduces outliers in a reconstruction zone 
of В± 5 mm for leg length and global and femoral offset restoration compared with 
intraoperative fluoroscopy during minimally invasive (MIS) THA with the patient 
in a lateral decubitus position.
METHODS: In this prospective study a consecutive series of 125 patients were 
randomized to either navigation-guided or fluoroscopy-controlled THA using 
sealed, opaque envelopes. All patients received the same cementless prosthetic 
components through an anterolateral MIS approach while they were in a lateral 
decubitus position. Leg length, global or total offset (representing the 
combination of femoral and acetabular offset), and femoral offset differences 
were restored using either navigation or fluoroscopy. Postoperatively, residual 
leg length and global and femoral offset discrepancies were analyzed on 
magnification-corrected radiographs of the pelvis by an independent and blinded 
examiner using digital planning software. Accuracy was defined as the relative 
postoperative difference between the surgically treated and the unaffected 
contralateral side for leg length and offset, respectively; precision was 
defined as the absolute postoperative deviation of leg length and global and 
femoral offset regardless of lengthening or shortening of leg length and offset 
throughout the THA. All analyses were performed per intention-to-treat.
RESULTS: Analyzing the relative accuracy of leg length restoration we found a 
mean difference of 0.2 mm (95% CI, -1.0 to +1.4 mm; p = 0.729) between 
fluoroscopy and navigation, 0.2 mm (95 % CI, -0.9 to +1.3 mm; p = 0.740) for 
global offset and 1.7 mm (95 % CI, +0.4 to +2.9 mm; p = 0.008) for femoral 
offset. For the absolute precision of leg length and global and femoral offset 
equalization, there was a mean difference of 1.7 В± 0.3 mm (p < 0.001) between 
fluoroscopy and navigation. The biomechanical reconstruction with a residual leg

the absolute precision of leg length and global and femoral offset equalization; 
and (3) reduces outliers in a reconstruction zone of ± 5 mm for leg length and 
global and femoral offset restoration.
METHODS: In this prospective study a consecutive series of 125 patients were 
randomized to either navigation-guided or fluoroscopy-controlled THA using 
sealed, opaque envelopes. All patients received the same cementless prosthetic 
components through an anterolateral MIS approach while they were in a lateral 
decubitus position. The primary outcome was relative accuracy of leg length 
restoration. Secondary outcomes included global offset accuracy, femoral offset 
accuracy, absolute precision of leg length and offset equalization, and outliers 
in reconstruction zones. Postoperatively, residual leg length and global and 
femoral offset discrepancies were analyzed on magnification-corrected 
radiographs of the pelvis by an independent and blinded examiner using digital 
planning software. Accuracy was defined as the relative postoperative difference 
between the surgically treated and the unaffected contralateral side for leg 
length and offset, respectively; precision was defined as the absolute 
postoperative deviation of leg length and global and femoral offset regardless 
of lengthening or shortening of leg length and offset throughout the THA. All 
analyses were performed per intention-to-treat.
RESULTS: For the primary outcome of relative accuracy of leg length restoration, 
there was a mean difference of 0.2 mm (95% CI, -1.0 to +1.4 mm; p = 0.729) 
between fluoroscopy and navigation. For secondary outcomes, global offset showed 
a mean difference of 0.2 mm (95% CI, -0.9 to +1.3 mm; p = 0.740) and femoral 
offset showed a mean difference of 1.7 mm (95% CI, +0.4 to +2.9 mm; p = 0.008). 
For the absolute precision of leg length and global and femoral offset 
equalization, there was a mean difference of 1.7 ± 0.3 mm (p < 0.001) between 
fluoroscopy and navigation. The biomechanical reconstruction with a residual leg 
length and global and femoral offset discrepancy less than 5 mm and less than 8 
mm, respectively, succeeded in 93% and 98%, respectively, in the navigation 
group and in 54% and 95%, respectively, in the fluoroscopy group.
CONCLUSIONS: Imageless navigation was not more effective than intraoperative 
fluoroscopy for leg length restoration in patients undergoing MIS THA with the 
patient in the lateral decubitus position.",spin, Yes,yes,"[{'token': 29871, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.0003296785580459982, 'probability': 0.9996703863143921}, {'token': 3869, 'token_string': 'Yes', 'logits': -0.0013102050870656967, 'probability': 0.9986907243728638}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.59095299243927, 'probability': 0.5537992715835571}]"

METHODS: Fifty-four patients diagnosed with unilateral painful calcific 
tendinitis were randomly allocated to a US needling or ESWT group. The US 
needling group underwent US-guided needling and received a subacromial 
corticosteroid injection. The ESWT group received ESWT 3 times a week. All

subjects presented to the ED with an asthma exacerbation, had partial response 
to treatment, and greater than or equal to 1 additional exacerbation within the 
previous year. Subjects received 1 intravenous infusion of placebo (n = 38) or 
benralizumab (0.3 mg/kg, n = 36 or 1.0 mg/kg, n = 36) added to outpatient 
management. The primary outcome was the proportion of subjects with greater than 
or equal to 1 exacerbation at 12 weeks in placebo vs the combined benralizumab 
groups. Secondary outcomes included the time-weighted rate of exacerbations at week 
12, adverse events, blood eosinophil counts, asthma symptom changes, and health 
care resource utilization.
RESULTS: The proportion of subjects with greater than or equal to 1 asthma 
exacerbation at 12 weeks was not different between placebo and the combined 
benralizumab groups (38.9% vs 33.3%; P = .67). The time-weighted rate of 
exacerbations was 3.59 in the placebo group vs 1.82 in the combined benralizumab 
groups (P = .01). Exacerbations resulting in hospitalization were 1.62 in the 
placebo group vs 0.65 in the combined benralizumab groups (P = .02). Benralizumab 
reduced blood eosinophil counts but did not affect other outcomes, while 
demonstrating an acceptable safety profile.
CONCLUSIONS: Benralizumab was not more effective than placebo on the primary 
outcome in patients who presented to the ED with acute asthma.",spin, Yes,yes,"[{'token': 29871, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.00017438798386137933, 'probability': 0.999825656414032}, {'token': 3869, 'token_string': 'Yes', 'logits': -0.0003256267518736422, 'probability': 0.999674379825592}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.2629204988479614, 'probability': 0.7688030004501343}]"

ganglion block for the treatment of acute anterior headache in the emergency 
department (ED) using a novel noninvasive delivery device.
METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial 
evaluating bupivacaine anesthesia of the sphenopalatine ganglion for acute 
anterior or global-based headache. This study was completed in 2 large academic 
EDs. Bupivacaine or normal saline solution was delivered intranasally (0.3 mL 
per side) with the Tx360 device. Pain and nausea were measured at 0, 5, and 15 
minutes by a 100-mm visual analog scale. The primary endpoint was a 50% 
reduction in pain at 15 minutes. Telephone follow-up assessed 24-hour pain and 
nausea through a 0- to 10-point verbal scale and adverse effects.
RESULTS: The median reported baseline pain in the bupivacaine group was 80 mm 
(IQR 66 mm - 93 mm) and 78.5 mm (IQR 64 mm to 91.75 mm) in the normal saline 
solution group. A 50% reduction in pain was achieved in 48.8% of the bupivacaine

Earlier transfusion with higher blood product ratios (plasma, platelets, and red blood cells), defined as damage control resuscitation, has been associated with improved outcomes; however, there have been no large multicenter clinical trials.

Objective: To determine the effectiveness and safety of transfusing patients with severe trauma and major bleeding using plasma, platelets, and red blood cells in a 1:1:1 ratio compared with a 1:1:2 ratio.

Design, setting, and participants: Pragmatic, phase 3, multisite, randomized clinical trial of 680 severely injured patients who arrived at 1 of 12 level I trauma centers in North America directly from the scene and were predicted to require massive transfusion between August 2012 and December 2013.

Interventions: Blood product ratios of 1:1:1 (338 patients) vs 1:1:2 (342 patients) during active resuscitation in addition to all local standard-of-care interventions (uncontrolled).

Main outcomes and measures: Primary outcomes were 24-hour and 30-day all-cause mortality. Prespecified ancillary outcomes included time to hemostasis, blood product volumes transfused, complications, incidence of surgical procedures, and functional status.

Results: No significant differences were detected in mortality at 24 hours (12.7% in 1:1:1 group vs 17.0% in 1:1:2 group; difference, -4.2% [95% CI, -9.6% to 1.1%]; P = .12) or at 30 days (22.4% vs 26.1%, respectively; difference, -3.7% [95% CI, -10.2% to 2.7%]; P = .26).

Earlier transfusion with higher blood product ratios (plasma, platelets, and red blood cells), defined as damage control resuscitation, has been associated with improved outcomes; however, there have been no large multicenter clinical trials.

Objective: To determine the effectiveness and safety of transfusing patients with severe trauma and major bleeding using plasma, platelets, and red blood cells in a 1:1:1 ratio compared with a 1:1:2 ratio.

Design, setting, and participants: Pragmatic, phase 3, multisite, randomized clinical trial of 680 severely injured patients who arrived at 1 of 12 level I trauma centers in North America directly from the scene and were predicted to require massive transfusion between August 2012 and December 2013.

Interventions: Blood product ratios of 1:1:1 (338 patients) vs 1:1:2 (342 patients) during active resuscitation in addition to all local standard-of-care interventions (uncontrolled).

Main outcomes and measures: Primary outcomes were 24-hour and 30-day all-cause mortality. Prespecified ancillary outcomes included time to hemostasis, blood product volumes transfused, complications, incidence of surgical procedures, and functional status.

Results: No significant differences were detected in mortality at 24 hours (12.7% in 1:1:1 group vs 17.0% in 1:1:2 group; difference, -4.2% [95% CI, -9.6% to 1.1%]; P = .12) or at 30 days (22.4% vs 26.1%, respectively; difference, -3.7% [95% CI, -10.2% to 2.7%]; P = .26). Exsanguination, which was the predominant cause of death within the first 24 hours, was significantly decreased in the 1:1:1 group (9.2% vs 14.6% in 1:1:2 group; difference, -5.4% [95% CI, -10.4% to -0.5%]; P = .03). More patients in the 1:1:1 group achieved hemostasis than in the 1:1:2 group (86% vs 78%, respectively; P = .006). Despite the 1:1:1 group receiving more plasma (median of 7 U vs 5 U, P < .001) and platelets (12 U vs 6 U, P < .001) and similar amounts of red blood cells (9 U) over the first 24 hours, no differences between the 2 groups were found for the 23 prespecified complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure, venous thromboembolism, sepsis, and transfusion-related complications.

Conclusions and relevance: Among patients with severe trauma and major bleeding, early administration of plasma, platelets, and red blood cells in a 1:1:1 ratio compared with a 1:1:2 ratio did not result in significant differences in mortality at 24 hours or at 30 days. However, more patients in the 1:1:1 group achieved hemostasis and fewer experienced death due to exsanguination by 24 hours. Even though there was an increased use of plasma and platelets transfused in the 1:1:1 group, no other safety differences were identified between the 2 groups.",no_spin, Yes,yes,"[{'token': 29871, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.000324673397699371, 'probability': 0.9996753334999084}, {'token': 3869, 'token_string': 'Yes', 'logits': -0.0014618673594668508, 'probability': 0.9985392689704895}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.33091869950294495, 'probability': 0.718263566493988}]"

25791446,The John Insall Award: No Functional Benefit After Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty Performed With Patient-specific Instrumentation: A Randomized Trial.,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,,"""Trend toward significance"" // ""Numerically longer survival"" or equivalent verbiage",Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Background:В Component alignment can influence implant longevity as well as perhaps pain and function after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), but correct alignment is not consistently achieved. To increase the likelihood that good alignment will be achieved during surgery, smart tools such as robotics or patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) have been introduced.
Questions/purposes:В We hypothesized that UKA performed with PSI would result in improved level gait as ascertained with three-dimensional analysis, implant positioning, and patient-reported outcomes measured by a validated scoring system when compared with conventional instrumentation 3 months and 1 year after surgery.
Methods:В We randomized 60 patients into two groups using either the PSI technique or a conventional technique. All patients were operated on using the same technique and the same cemented metal-backed implant. Mean age of the patients was 63 В± 4 years (range, 54-72 years) and mean body mass index was 28 В± 3 kg/m(2). Patients were evaluated preoperatively, at 3 months, and 1 year after surgery by an independent observer blind to the type of technique. Gait parameters were assessed with three-dimensional analysis during level walking preoperatively and at 1 year, frontal and sagittal position of the implant was evaluated on full-length radiographs at 3 months, and subjective functional outcome and quality of life using routine questionnaires (SF-12, new Knee Society Score [KSS], Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) at 3 months and 1 year. This study had 80% power to detect a 15% difference in walking speed at the p < 0.05 level.
Results:В One year after surgery, there were no differences between the two groups in the analyzed gait spatiotemporal parameters, respectively, for PSI UKA and conventional UKA : double limb support 31% (25%-54%) versus 30% (23%-56%; p = 0.67) and walking speed (1.59 m/s [0.86-1.87 m/s] versus 1.57 m/s [0.71-1.96 m/s]; p = 0.41). No difference was observed between the two groups in terms of lower limb alignment (PSI group 178В° В± 3В°, conventional group 178В° В± 4В°; p = 0.24) or implant positioning on mediolateral and anteroposterior radiographs. There were no differences in the functional score between the PSI and conventional TKA groups at 3 months and 1 year after surgery: KSS objective knee scores (PSI: 85 В± 8 points at 3 months, 87 В± 5 points at 1 year and conventional instrumentation: 82 В± 8 points at 3 months 83 В± 6 points at 1 year; p = 0.10) and functional activity scores were similar in both group (PSI: 71 В± 12 points at 3 months and 74 В± 7 points at 1 year versus conventional group: 73 В± 11 points at 3 months and 75 В± 6 at 1 year; p = 0.9).
Conclusions:В Our observations suggest that PSI may confer small, if any, advantage in alignment, pain, or function after UKA.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term results of primary ACL reconstruction using 
either an allograft or autograft.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: From June 2002 to August 2003, patients with a symptomatic 
ACL-deficient knee were randomized to receive either a hamstring autograft or 
tibialis posterior allograft. All allografts were from a single tissue bank, 
aseptically processed, and fresh-frozen without terminal irradiation. Graft 
fixation was identical in all knees. All patients followed the same 
postoperative rehabilitation protocol, which was blinded to the therapists. 
Preoperative and postoperative assessments were performed via examination and/or 
telephone and Internet-based questionnaire to ascertain the functional and 
subjective status using established knee metrics. The primary outcome measures 
were graft integrity, subjective knee stability, and functional status.
RESULTS: There were 99 patients (100 knees); 86 were men, and 95% were

been published comparing tibialis posterior allografts to hamstring autografts.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term results of primary ACL reconstruction using 
either an allograft or autograft.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: From June 2002 to August 2003, patients with a symptomatic 
ACL-deficient knee were randomized to receive either a hamstring autograft or 
tibialis posterior allograft. All allografts were from a single tissue bank, 
aseptically processed, and fresh-frozen without terminal irradiation. Graft 
fixation was identical in all knees. All patients followed the same 
postoperative rehabilitation protocol, which was blinded to the therapists. 
Preoperative and postoperative assessments were performed via examination and/or 
telephone and Internet-based questionnaire to ascertain the functional and 
subjective status using established knee metrics. The primary outcome measures 
were graft integrity, subjective knee stability, and functional status.
RESULTS: There were 99 patients (100 knees); 86 were men, and 95% were 
active-duty military. Both groups were similar in demographics and preoperative 
activity level. The mean and median ages of both groups were identical at 29 and 
26 years, respectively. Concomitant meniscal and chondral pathologic

However, there are few well-designed studies comparing approaches to treatment.

Questions/purposes: (1) Which treatment (compression bandaging with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], aspiration, or aspiration with steroid injections) is associated with the highest likelihood of resolution of nonseptic olecranon bursitis? (2) Which treatment is associated with earliest resolution of symptoms? (3) What factors are associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks?

Methods: We enrolled 133 patients from two centers; after applying prespecified exclusions (septic bursitis or concomitant inflammatory arthritis, intraarticular elbow pathology, recent aspiration or steroid injection done elsewhere, and refusal to participate), 90 patients were randomly allocated to receive compression bandaging with NSAIDs (C), aspiration (A), or aspiration with steroid injection (AS) groups (30 patients in each). The groups were similar at baseline in terms of age and gender. Seven patients (four from Group A and three from Group AS) were lost to followup. All patients were followed up weekly for 4 weeks, and the same treatment procedure was repeated if the bursitis recurred with any substantial fluid collection. At 4 weeks, the state of resolution and pain visual analog scale (VAS) were evaluated. Failed resolution was defined as presence of persistent olecranon bursal fluid collection at Week 4 after the initiation of the treatment; on the contrary, if bursal fluid collection was clinically reduced or completely disappeared by the end of Week 4, the treatment was considered successful. We compared the proportion of resolution by Week 4 and the median times to resolution among the treatment groups. In addition, we evaluated whether the resolution affected pain VAS and what factors were associated with the resolution.

Results: There were no differences in the proportion of patients whose bursitis resolved by Week 4 among the three treatment groups (Group C: 25 of 30 [83%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.27-1.72], p = 0.580; Group A: 17 of 26 [65%], relative risk of resolution failure: 2.19 [95% CI, 0.98-4.87], p = 0.083; Group AS: 23 of 27 [85%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.59 [95% CI, 0.22-1.63], p = 0.398) (p = 0.073). Steroid injection after aspiration (Group AS) was associated with the earliest resolution (2.3 weeks [range, 1-4 weeks]) when compared with aspiration alone (Group A; 3.1 weeks [range, 2-4 weeks]) and compression bandaging with NSAIDs (Group C; 3.2 weeks [range, 2-4 weeks]), p = 0.015). Longer duration of symptoms before treatment was the only factor associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks (failed resolution: 6 weeks [range, 2-9 weeks]; successful resolution: 4 weeks [range, 0.4-6 weeks]; p = 0.008).

Conclusions: With the numbers available, there were no differences in efficacy when compression bandaging with NSAIDs, aspiration, and aspiration with steroid injection were compared. However, we were powered only to detect a 30% difference, meaning that if there were a smaller difference in efficacy among the groups, we might not have detected it in a study of this size. Our data can be used as pilot data to power future prospective (and likely multicenter) trials. Because olecranon bursitis can recur, and because treatments like aspiration and aspiration with steroid injection can cause complications, unless future trials demonstrate clear efficacy advantages of aspiration and/or injection both at short and longer terms, we suggest that compression bandaging and a short course of NSAIDs may offer the most appropriate balance of safety and efficacy.",no_spin, Yes,yes,"[{'token': 29871, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.00013600854435935616, 'probability': 0.9998639822006226}, {'token': 3869, 'token_string': 'Yes', 'logits': -0.0011135098757222295, 'probability': 0.9988871216773987}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.492747962474823, 'probability': 0.6109452843666077}]"

Our hypothesis was that there would be no differences in joint line angles or correction accuracy between the two groups, that patellar height would increase after CW HTO and decrease after OW HTO, and that leg length and posterior tibial slope would decrease after CW HTO and increase after OW HTO.

Methods: Radiological data were collected from 70 patients participating in an ongoing prospective randomized clinical trial comparing OW and CW HTOs. Digital standing hip-knee-ankle (HKA) radiographs as well as lateral radiographs in 30Ў of flexion were obtained preoperatively and at 6 months for each patient. Joint line angles, HKA angle, leg length, Insall-Salvati index, Miura-Kawamura index and posterior tibial slope were measured using medical planning software. The complete preoperative radiological examinations of the first 50 patients were used in a study of intra- and inter-rater reliability of the measurements.

Results: The mean posterior slope was reduced by 2.5Ў in CW HTO, whereas it remained unchanged in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Mean leg length decreased 5.7 mm in CW HTO and increased 3.1 mm in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Changes in joint line angles, patellar height indexes and the correction accuracy showed no significant differences comparing the two techniques. Frontal plane reliability measurement intra- and inter-rater intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) varied from 0.81 to 0.99. Sagittal plane intra- and inter-rater ICC varied from 0.60 to 0.87. Posterior tibial slope intra- and inter-rater ICC showed the lowest values (0.70 and 0.60, respectively) corresponding to a smallest real difference of 4.5Ў and 5.5Ў, respectively.

Conclusions: Posterior tibial slope and leg length changes were significantly different in CW compared to OW HTOs.

Objective: To test the hypothesis that high-intensity endurance training (ET) is superior to moderate-intensity ET for improving risk factors for type 2 diabetes in overweight adolescents.

Design and methods: In this randomized trial, 106 overweight and obese adolescents (15.2 years; 76% female; 62% Caucasian) were randomly assigned to high-intensity ET (70-85% of heart rate reserve, n=38), moderate-intensity ET (40-55% heart rate reserve; n=32) or control for 6 months (n=36).

Intention-to-treat analyses revealed that, at follow-up, insulin sensitivity was not different between high-intensity (-1.0 mU kg(-1) min(-1); 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.6, +1.4 mU kg(-1) min(-1)) and moderate-intensity (+0.26 mU kg(-1) min(-1); 95% CI: -1.3, +1.8 mU kg(-1) min(-1)) ET arms compared with controls (interaction, P=0.97). Similarly, hepatic triglyceride at follow-up was not different in high-intensity (-1.7% fat/water (F/W); 95% CI: -7.0, +3.6% F/W) and moderate-intensity (-0.40% FW; 95% CI: -6.0, +5.3% F/W) ET compared with controls. Both high intensity (+4.4 ml per kg-FFM (fat-free mass) per minute; 95% CI: 1.7, 7.1 ml kg-FFM(-1) min(-1)) and moderate intensity (+4.4 ml kg-FFM(-1) min(-1); 95% CI: 1.6, 7.3 ml kg-FFM(-1) min(-1)) increased cardiorespiratory fitness, relative to controls (interaction P<0.001).

well-functioning TKA with long survival of its implants. This prospective 
randomized study comparing navigation-assisted TKA and conventional TKA reported 
the clinical and radiological outcomes at a follow-up of 9В years. The purpose of 
this study was to compare the clinical and radiological outcomes for patients 
who underwent navigation-assisted TKA or conventional TKA after long-term 
follow-up.
METHODS: A total of 80 patients (88 knees) were available for physical and 
radiological examination 9В years after TKA. Clinical outcomes were evaluated 
using HSS, WOMAC, and KS function and pain scores. And radiological outcomes of 
the component loosening and its survivorship during 9-year follow-up were also 
evaluated.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the field of clinical outcomes 
between the two groups. In terms of radiological outcomes, the navigation group 
had fewer alignment outliers (7.3 vs 20В %, pВ =В 0.006). Although the clinical 
outcomes showed no differences between the two groups, the survival rate was 
slightly better in the navigation group than in the conventional group without

well-functioning TKA with long survival of its implants. The purpose of 
this study was to compare the clinical and radiological outcomes for patients 
who underwent navigation-assisted TKA or conventional TKA after long-term 
follow-up.
METHODS: A total of 80 patients (88 knees) were available for physical and 
radiological examination 9 years after TKA. Clinical outcomes were evaluated 
using HSS, WOMAC, and KS function and pain scores. Radiological outcomes of 
the component loosening and its survivorship during 9-year follow-up were also 
evaluated.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in clinical outcomes 
between the two groups. In terms of radiological outcomes, the navigation group 
had fewer alignment outliers (7.3 vs 20%, p = 0.006). The survival rate 
showed no statistically significant difference between groups (best-case scenario 100 vs 95.3%, n.s., worst-case

It delays mobilization, increases opioid consumption and side effects, and lengthens hospitalization. This challenge multiplies when treating an opioid-dependent population. We examined whether a novel suspended release local anesthetic, liposomal bupivacaine (LB) would improve pain control and decrease opioid consumption after TKA compared to a standard periarticular injection in opioid-dependent patients.

Methods: Thirty-eight patients undergoing TKA were randomly assigned to receive either a periarticular injection (PAI) with LB (n = 20) or with a standard PAI (including a combination of ropivacaine, clonidine, Toradol, Epinepherine, and saline; n = 18) as part of a multimodal pain management approach. All periarticular injections were done by a single surgeon. Perioperative treatment was similar between groups.

8 hours apart. Blood was drawn at several time points for IL-6, prothrombin 
fragment 1.2, and plasmin-alpha-2-antiplasmin complex, a marker of fibrinolysis. 
In-hospital visual analog pain (visual analog scale) scores, patient-controlled 
analgesia use, and ability to climb stairs were recorded.
RESULTS: Mean serum IL-6 levels at 6 and 24 hours postoperatively were 
significantly lower for the study group, whereas serum prothrombin fragment 1.2 
and plasmin-alpha-2-antiplasmin were not statistically different at any study 
time point. Average pain scores were similar (P > .05), but study group 
experience less severe pain (P < .01) and less patient-controlled analgesia (PВ = 
.02). At 3 months, 4 patients in the placebo and 1 patient in the study group 
had difficulty going up and down staircases (PВ = .08).
CONCLUSION: The use of corticosteroids was associated with a statistically 
significant decrease in IL-6 at 6 and 24 hours postoperatively but did not 
affect thrombogenic markers. The study group had improved postoperative 
analgesia and a trend toward improved functional outcome at 3 months

HYPOTHESIS: In ACI, the dose level may have an influence on medium-term magnetic 
resonance morphological findings after treatment.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: A total of 75 patients who underwent ACI using a pure, autologous, 
third-generation matrix-associated ACI product were divided into 3 groups 
representing different doses: 3 to 7 spheroids/cm(2), 10 to 30 spheroids/cm(2), 
and 40 to 70 spheroids/cm(2). Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 1.5, 
3, 6, and 12 months after ACI and was evaluated by the magnetic resonance 
observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score and the Knee injury and 
Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS).
RESULTS: MOCART scores showed improvements after 3 months, with slight dose 
dependence, and further improvement after 12 months, although without 
significant dose dependence. The mean MOCART scores after 3 months (0 = worst, 
100 = best) were 59.8, 64.5, and 64.7 for the low-, medium-, and high-dose

74.5, and 68.8 for the respective dose groups and 72.4 for all patients. Several 
MOCART items (surface of repair tissue, structure of repair tissue, signal

response with the medium and high doses than with the low dose, suggesting a 
potential dose relationship. No significant correlation between the MOCART

This study compared the outcomes of tenotomy with outcomes of tenodesis for treatment of LHBT lesions with rotator cuff tears.

Methods: The study enrolled 128 patients with LHBT lesions and small- to medium-sized rotator cuff tear. Arthroscopic LHBT tenotomy was done in 56 patients (group I), and LHBT tenodesis was done for 72 patients (group II) with rotator cuff repair. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Score, simple shoulder test, pain visual analog scale, range of motion, and cosmetic changes were assessed initially, at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively, and the last visit. The elbow motor power and magnetic resonance imaging were evaluated at 12 months.

Results: Both groups showed improvement in functional scores after treatments, but no significant difference was found between the 2 groups at each assessment. The rate of Popeye deformity was 3 times higher in group I (P = .04). Group II showed greater forearm supination power than group I (P = .02). On magnetic resonance imaging, 45 patients (80.4%) in group I showed maintenance of the LHBT cut end within the bicipital groove, whereas 65 patients (90.3%) in group II showed maintenance of fixated LHBT.

This study compared the outcomes of tenotomy with outcomes of tenodesis for treatment of LHBT lesions with rotator cuff tears.

Methods: The study enrolled 128 patients with LHBT lesions and small- to medium-sized rotator cuff tear. Arthroscopic LHBT tenotomy was done in 56 patients (group I), and LHBT tenodesis was done for 72 patients (group II) with rotator cuff repair. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Score, simple shoulder test, pain visual analog scale, range of motion, cosmetic changes, elbow motor power, and magnetic resonance imaging were assessed initially, at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively, and the last visit.

Results: No significant difference was found between the 2 groups in functional scores at each assessment. The rate of Popeye deformity was 3 times higher in group I (P = .04). Group II showed greater forearm supination power than group I (P = .02). On magnetic resonance imaging, 45 patients (80.4%) in group I showed maintenance of the LHBT cut end within the bicipital groove, whereas 65 patients (90.3%) in group II showed maintenance of fixated LHBT.

patients is under debate.
PURPOSE: To compare clinical outcomes and calf muscle strength recovery after 
the nonsurgical treatment and open surgical repair of acute Achilles tendon 
ruptures with identical accelerated rehabilitation programs.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: From 2009 to 2013, a total of 60 patients with an acute Achilles tendon 
rupture were randomized to surgery or nonsurgical treatment. Nonsurgical 
treatment included first a week of cast immobilization, followed by a functional 
orthosis for 6 weeks, allowing full weightbearing after week 1 and active 
plantar flexion after week 5. Surgery was simple end-to-end open repair, and 
postoperative treatment was identical to nonsurgical treatment. The primary outcome 
was the Leppilahti Achilles tendon performance score. Secondary outcomes included 
isokinetic calf muscle strength and RAND 36-Item Health Survey at 18-month follow-up.
RESULTS: At 18-month follow-up, the mean Leppilahti score was 79.5 and 75.7 for 
the surgically and nonsurgically treated groups, respectively (mean difference, 
3.8; 95% CI, -1.9 to 9.5; P = .19). Angle-specific peak torque results of 
affected legs at 18 months showed a 14% difference in the peak torque of the 
affected leg favoring the surgical group versus the nonsurgical group (mean peak 
torque, 110.3 vs 96.5 N·m, respectively; mean difference, 13.6 N·m; 95% CI, 
2.0-25.1 N·m; P = .022). The RAND 36-Item Health Survey indicated differences 
in the domains of physical functioning (P = .006) and bodily pain (P = .037) 
for surgically treated patients.
CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment was not more effective than nonsurgical treatment 
on the Leppilahti Achilles tendon performance score in patients with acute 
Achilles tendon ruptures.

the difference varied from 16% to 24% (P = .016), favoring the surgically 
treated group, whereas at 18 months, surgically treated patients had 10% to 18% 
greater strength results (P = .037). At 18 months, a 14% difference in the peak 
torque of the affected leg favored the surgical group versus the nonsurgical 
group (mean peak torque, 110.3 vs 96.5 NВ·m, respectively; mean difference, 13.6

better results in the domains of physical functioning (P = .006) and bodily pain

CONCLUSION: Surgical and nonsurgical treatments of acute Achilles tendon 
ruptures have similar results in terms of the Achilles tendon performance score, 
but surgery restores calf muscle strength earlier over the entire range of 
motion of the ankle joint, with a 10% to 18% strength difference favoring 
surgery at 18 months. Surgery may also result in better health-related quality 
of life in the domains of physical functioning and bodily pain compared with 
nonsurgical treatment.

There is still a need for a method of anesthesia that can deliver effective long-term postoperative pain relief without incurring the high cost and health burden of opioids and nerve blocks.

Questions/purposes: (1) Is liposomal bupivacaine-based periarticular injection (PAI) more effective than morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA? (2) Do patients treated with liposomal bupivacaine-based PAI experience fewer opioid-related adverse events compared with patients treated with morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA?

Methods: This multicenter, blind trial randomized 119 patients undergoing TKA with spinal anesthesia to receive spinal anesthesia plus periarticular injection with liposomal bupivacaine (40 patients), spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine plus intrathecal morphine (41 patients) but no liposomal bupivacaine injection, or spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine (38 patients) and no liposomal bupivacaine injection. The two groups that did not receive periarticular liposomal bupivacaine did receive periarticular injection with ropivacaine, and all three groups had ketorolac (30 mg) plus epinephrine (1:1000) in the periarticular injections. Patients in all three groups received identical perioperative multimodal analgesic and antiemetic drugs. All patients were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized and no patients were lost to followup. The primary study endpoints were visual analog score (VAS) for pain and narcotic use during postoperative day 1. Secondary endpoints included side effects associated with narcotic administration during the hospital stay.

Results: Mean VAS pain in the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group was lower than that for the ropivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (1.8 ± 2.1 versus 3.3 ± 2.3, p = 0.005, mean difference: 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-2.5) and 12 hours (1.5 ± 2.0 versus 3.3 ± 2.4, p < 0.001, mean difference: 1.8, 95% CI, 0.8-2.8) after surgery. The morphine spinal group had lower pain compared with the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (0.9 ± 1.8 versus 1.8 ± 2.1, p = 0.035, mean difference: 1.0, 95% CI, 0.1-1.8), but there was no difference at 12 hours (0.8 ± 1.5 versus 1.5 ± 2.0, p = 0.086, mean difference: 0.7, 95% CI, -0.1 to 1.5).

surgical procedures were performed by the same senior surgeon using the DB 
reconstruction technique. All irradiated hamstring tendon allografts were 
sterilized with 2.5 Mrad of irradiation before distribution and were obtained 
from a single certified tissue bank. Graft fixation on the femoral side was by 
an Endobutton, and on the tibial side by a bioabsorbable interference screw 
augmented with a staple. The same rehabilitation protocol was applied to all

jump and Daniel 1-legged hop tests, Lysholm score, Tegner score, International 
Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) standard evaluation form, and Cincinnati 
knee score.
RESULTS: A total of 83 patients (Auto: n = 40 [mean age, 29.2 В± 6.9 years]; 
Ir-Allo: n = 43 [mean age, 28.6 В± 7.2 years]) fulfilled follow-up and clinical 
evaluations. No significant differences were found between the 2 groups 
according to the overall IKDC functional and subjective evaluations as well as 
testing of activity levels. Significant between-group differences were found 
when comparing the results at final follow-up according to the Lachman test, 
anterior drawer test, pivot-shift test, and KT-2000 arthrometer measurements (P 
< .001). Most importantly, 87.5% of patients in the Auto group and 34.9% in the 
Ir-Allo group had a side-to-side difference <3 mm. The rate of laxity 
(side-to-side difference >5 mm) with an irradiated allograft (30.2%) was higher 
than that with an autograft (7.5%) (P < .001). The failure rate in the Ir-Allo 
group (30.2%) was higher than that in the Auto group (7.5%) (P < .001). Anterior 
and rotational stability decreased significantly in the Ir-Allo group; patients 
in the Ir-Allo group also had a shorter operation time. There were 10.0% (4/40) 
of patients in the Auto group and 32.6% (19/43) of patients in the Ir-Allo group 
who had arthritic progression (P < .05).
CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences in postoperative activity 
levels and functional outcomes between the Auto and Ir-Allo groups. However, a 
significant increase in anterior and rotational laxity in the Ir-Allo group was 
found according to evaluations. We do not advocate an irradiated hamstring

METHODS: A total of 90 patients, 18 to 55 years old, were included according to 
the following criteria: (1) chronic, symptomatic meniscal tears requiring 
partial resection; (2) a healthy contralateral knee; (3) no previous surgery on 
the index knee; and (4) no other concurrent articular lesions requiring surgical 
treatment (eg, cartilage or ligament injuries). Patients were randomized into 2

groin pain and diminished functional outcome after THA. So far, estimation by 
eye and palpation is the standard procedure to intraoperatively assess the 
distance of the cup to the anterior rim. However, novel technologies such as 
imageless navigation enable intraoperative measurements of the cup in relation 
to the psoas tendon and bony landmarks.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether psoas impingement can be reduced using 
imageless navigation compared with the standard technique.
METHODS: The current study is a reanalysis of data from a randomized controlled 
trial evaluating navigation for THA; 135 patients were randomized for surgery 
with or without the use of imageless navigation. The primary outcome was the 
risk for anterior protrusion of the cup above the acetabular rim and thus 
potential psoas impingement, defined as an overhang of the cup above the 
anterior acetabular rim as measured on postoperative CT, which was either 
controlled with the help of navigation or standard control by eye and palpation 
intraoperatively. Postoperatively, the anterior protrusion of the cup above the 
acetabular rim was measured on three-dimensional (3-D) CT by a blinded, external 
institute. In addition to patient-related outcome measures, the Harris hip 
score, Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and EuroQol were 
obtained 1 year postoperatively. Altogether 123 data sets were available for 
primary analysis and 115 were available for 1-year followup.

navigated and the control groups in terms of the mean distance of the cup below 
the anterosuperior acetabular rim (3.9 mm; -5.3 to 12.6 mm versus 4.4 mm; -7.9

Methods: Forty-two consecutive patients scheduled for hip arthroscopy were randomized into 2 postoperative pain control groups. One group received preemptive intra-articular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection, and the second group received preemptive periacetabular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection. Before closure all patients received an additional dose of 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% intra-articularly. Data were compared with respect to postoperative pain with visual analog scale (VAS) and analgesic consumption, documented in a pain diary for 2 weeks after surgery.

Results: Twenty-one patients were treated with intra-articular injection, and 21 patients with peri-acetabular injection.

Data were compared with respect to postoperative pain with visual analog scale (VAS) and analgesic consumption, documented in a pain diary for 2 weeks after surgery.

Results: Twenty-one patients were treated with intra-articular injection, and 21 patients with peri-acetabular injection. There were no significant differences with regards to patient demographics or surgical procedures. VAS scores recorded during the first 30 minutes postoperatively were 0.667 ± 1.49 in the periacetabular group versus 2.11 ± 2.29 in the intra-articular group (P < .045). VAS scores at 18 hours after surgery were 2.62 ± 2.2 in the periacetabular group versus 4.79 ± 2.6 in the intra-articular group (P < .009). There were no differences between the groups with regard to analgesic consumption.

Methods: A total of 180 patients who were scheduled to undergo primary unilateral TKA in our level I trauma center were recorded and divided into groups A, B, C, and D randomly. Preoperative dose, an additional postoperative dose, and 2 postoperative additional doses of TA were infused intravenously in groups A (30 mg/kg), B (15 mg/kg), and C (10 mg/kg), respectively, and TA was not infused in group D. Blood loss (intraoperative, postoperative, and total blood loss), blood transfusion rate and volume, hemoglobin level, and incidence of deep vein thrombosis were analyzed.

Results: The total blood loss and postoperative blood loss were significantly lower in groups B and C compared to group D. There was no significant difference between groups B and C. For intraoperative blood loss, there was no significant difference between groups A and B and between groups B and C. Groups A, B, and C had lower intraoperative blood loss compared to group D.

(MPFL) reconstruction have both shown, either in isolation or in combination, to 
provide improved patellofemoral joint (PFJ) stability. There are few studies 
that provide evidence that this remains true in the long term.
PURPOSE: To compare the long-term results of patellar instability after TTT with 
and without MPFL reconstruction in 2 randomized groups.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: A total of 34 patients (36 knees) were randomized to 2 groups. The 
first group underwent lateral release (LR) and TTT for confirmed maltracking of 
the patella (control group). The second group underwent MPFL reconstruction in 
addition to TTT and LR (reconstruction group). The primary outcomes were 
validated questionnaires (Kujala score, Tegner activity score) and a visual 
analog scale (VAS) assessing their insecurity. Secondary outcomes included 
clinical assessment, redislocation rates, reoperation rates, time to return to 
activities, patient satisfaction, and quantitative computed tomography (CT) at 1 
year. Patients were followed up at a minimum of 5 years postoperatively. Two 
patients in the control group and 1 patient in the reconstruction group were 
lost to follow-up at 5 years.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the Kujala (P = .75), Tegner 
(P = .36), or VAS (P = .75) scores at any time period. One patient in the 
control group sustained a patellar redislocation at 3 years. Five patients in 
the control group and 2 in the reconstruction group had functional failures and 
required reoperations; however, this was not statistically significant (P =

(MPFL) reconstruction have both shown, either in isolation or in combination, to 
provide improved patellofemoral joint (PFJ) stability. There are few studies 
that provide evidence that this remains true in the long term.
PURPOSE: To compare the long-term results of patellar instability after TTT with 
and without MPFL reconstruction in 2 randomized groups.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: A total of 34 patients (36 knees) were randomized to 2 groups. The 
first group underwent lateral release (LR) and TTT for confirmed maltracking of 
the patella (control group). The second group underwent MPFL reconstruction in 
addition to TTT and LR (reconstruction group). Patients were followed up with 
validated questionnaires (Kujala score, Tegner activity score), a visual analog 
scale (VAS) assessing their insecurity, and a clinical assessment at a minimum 
of 5 years postoperatively. Participants also underwent quantitative computed 
tomography (CT) at 1 year for comparison. Two patients in the control group and 
1 patient in the reconstruction group were lost to follow-up at 5 years.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the Kujala ( P = .75), Tegner 
( P = .36), or VAS ( P = .75) scores at any time period. One patient in the 
control group sustained a patellar redislocation at 3 years. Five patients in 
the control group and 2 in the reconstruction group had functional failures and 
required reoperations; however, this was not statistically significant ( P = 
.30). There were no significant differences between groups in the time to return 
to school or work ( P = .65) or sports ( P = .38) after surgery. Overall patient 
satisfaction was higher in the reconstruction group compared with the control 
group ( P = .04), and quantitative CT scans showed that the reconstruction group 
had a statistically significant improvement in the mean patellar tilt (6В° vs 
-8В°, respectively; P = .03) and mean congruence angle (13В° vs -11В°, 
respectively; P = .03) in the quadriceps-contracted state compared with the 
control group.
CONCLUSION: Reconstruction of the MPFL in addition to TTT and LR resulted in 
improved alignment parameters (congruence angle, patellar tilt angle) as well as 
patient satisfaction. The Kujala and Tegner scores were no different between the 
2 groups at any time period. There was insufficient evidence to conclude that 
the addition of MPFL reconstruction to TTT results in fewer redislocations or 
reoperations. This study concludes that MPFL reconstruction improves PFJ 
alignment and patient satisfaction; however, further studies with larger patient 
numbers are required to satisfy its significance with respect to redislocation 
rates and functional scores in the long term.",no_spin, Yes,yes,"[{'token': 29871, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.0013553252210840583, 'probability': 0.9986456036567688}, {'token': 3869, 'token_string': 'Yes', 'logits': -0.0011631635716184974, 'probability': 0.9988375306129456}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.3494780659675598, 'probability': 0.7050560116767883}]"

PURPOSE: To compare the clinical and anatomic outcomes of the interference screw 
(IS) and suture anchor (SA) fixation techniques for biceps tenodesis performed 
along with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: A total of 80 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair 
with SLBC lesions were prospectively enrolled and randomly divided according to 
the tenodesis method: the IS and SA groups. The primary outcome was the anatomic 
status of tenodesis estimated using magnetic resonance imaging or 
ultrasonography. Anatomic failure of tenodesis was determined when the biceps 
tendon was not traced in the intertubercular groove directly from the insertion 
site of the IS or SA. Secondary outcomes included functional outcomes evaluated 
with the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, American Shoulder and Elbow 
Surgeons (ASES) score, Simple Shoulder Test (SST), Constant score, Korean 
Shoulder Score (KSS), and long head of the biceps (LHB) score at least 2 years

RESULTS: Thirty-three patients in the IS group and 34 in the SA group were 
monitored for more than 2 years. Nine anatomic failures of tenodesis were 
observed: 7 in the IS group and 2 in the SA group (P = .083). All postoperative

joint precede radiographic abnormalities of posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) 
by as much as decades. A growing body of evidence strongly suggests that the 
progression from anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury to PTOA is 
multifactorial, involving the interplay between biomechanical disturbances and 
biochemical homeostasis of articular cartilage.
PURPOSE: The purposes of this randomized study using an acute ACL injury model 
were to (1) evaluate the natural progression of inflammatory and 
chondrodegenerative biomarkers, (2) evaluate the relationship between subjective 
reports of pain and inflammatory and chondrodegenerative biomarkers, and (3) 
determine if postinjury arthrocentesis and corticosteroid injection offer the 
ability to alter this biochemical cascade.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: A total of 49 patients were randomized to 4 groups: group 1 
(corticosteroid at 4 days after ACL injury, placebo injection of saline at 2 
weeks), group 2 (placebo at 4 days after ACL injury, corticosteroid at 2 weeks), 
group 3 (corticosteroid at both time intervals), or a placebo group (saline 
injections at both time intervals). Patient-reported outcome measures and 
synovial biomarkers were collected at approximately 4 days, 11 days, and 5 weeks 
after injury. The change between the time points was assessed for all variables 
using Wilcoxon tests, and the relationship between changes in outcome scores and 
biomarkers were assessed by calculating Spearman ПЃ. Outcomes and biomarkers were 
also compared between the 4 groups using Kruskal-Wallis tests.
RESULTS: No adverse events or infections were observed in any study patients. 
With the exception of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) and tumor necrosis 
factor-inducible gene 6 (TSG-6), chondrodegenerative markers worsened over the 
first 5 weeks while all patient-reported outcomes improved during this time, 
regardless of treatment group. Patient-reported outcomes did not differ between 
patients receiving corticosteroid injections and the placebo group. However, 
increases in C-telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II), associated with 
collagen type II breakdown, were significantly greater in the placebo group 
(1.32 В± 1.10 ng/mL) than in either of the groups that received the 
corticosteroid injection within the first several days after injury (group 1: 
0.23 В± 0.27 ng/mL [ P = .01]; group 3: 0.19 В± 0.34 ng/mL [ P = .01]).
CONCLUSION: PTOA begins at the time of injury and results early on in dramatic 
matrix changes in the knee. However, it is encouraging that early intervention 
with an anti-inflammatory agent was able to affect biomarkers of chondral 
degeneration. Should early intervention lead to meaningful changes in either the 
onset or severity of symptomatic PTOA, the current treatment paradigm for 
patients with ACL injury may have to be restructured to include early aspiration

treatment focuses on management of respiratory distress and hypoxia. High-flow 
warm humidified oxygen (HFWHO) is increasingly used, but has not been rigorously 
studied in randomised trials. We aimed to examine whether HFWHO provided 
enhanced respiratory support, thereby shortening time to weaning off oxygen.
METHODS: In this open, phase 4, randomised controlled trial, we recruited 
children aged less than 24 months with moderate bronchiolitis attending the 
emergency department of the John Hunter Hospital or the medical unit of the John 
Hunter Children's Hospital in New South Wales, Australia. Patients were randomly 
allocated (1:1) via opaque sealed envelopes to HFWHO (maximum flow of 1 L/kg per 
min to a limit of 20 L/min using 1:1 air-oxygen ratio, resulting in a maximum 
FiO2 of 0В·6) or standard therapy (cold wall oxygen 100% via infant nasal 
cannulae at low flow to a maximum of 2 L/min) using a block size of four and 
stratifying for gestational age at birth. The primary outcome was time from 
randomisation to last use of oxygen therapy. All randomised children were 
included in the primary and secondary safety analyses. This trial is registered 
with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number

FINDINGS: From July 16, 2012, to May 1, 2015, we randomly assigned 202 children 
to either HFWHO (101 children) or standard therapy (101 children). Median time 
to weaning was 24 h (95% CI 18-28) for standard therapy and 20 h (95% CI 17-34) 
for HFWHO (hazard ratio [HR] for difference in survival distributions 0В·9 [95% 
CI 0В·7-1В·2]; log rank p=0В·61). Fewer children experienced treatment failure on 
HFWHO (14 [14%]) compared with standard therapy (33 [33%]; p=0В·0016); of these 
children, those on HFWHO were supported for longer than were those on standard 
therapy before treatment failure (HR 0В·3; 95% CI 0В·2-0В·6; p<0В·0001). 20 (61%) of 
33 children who experienced treatment failure on standard therapy were rescued 
with HFWHO. 12 (12%) of children on standard therapy required transfer to the 
intensive care unit compared with 14 (14%) of those on HFWHO (difference -1%; 
95% CI -7 to 16; p=0В·41). Four adverse events occurred (oxygen desaturation and 
condensation inhalation in the HFWHO group, and two incidences of oxygen tubing 
disconnection in the standard therapy group); none resulted in withdrawal from 
the trial. No oxygen-related serious adverse events occurred. Secondary 
effectiveness outcomes are reported in the Results section.

CAC for goal-directed therapy including access to immediate reperfusion, or (2) 
control: comprising current standard of care involving delivery to the 
geographically closest hospital. The feasibility of randomisation, protocol 
adherence and data collection of the primary (30-day all-cause mortality) and 
secondary (cerebral performance category (CPC)) and in-hospital major 
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) clinical outcome measures were 
assessed.
RESULTS: Between November 2014 and April 2016, 118 cases were screened, of which 
63 patients (53%) met eligibility criteria and 40 of the 63 patients (63%) were 
randomised. There were no protocol deviations in the treatment arm. Data 
collection of primary and secondary outcomes was achieved in 83%. There was no 
difference in baseline characteristics between the groups: 30-day mortality 
(Intervention 9/18, 50% vs. Control 6/15, 40%; P=0.73), CPC 1/2 (Intervention: 
9/18, 50% vs. Control 7/14, 50%; P>0.99) or MACCE (Intervention: 9/18, 50% vs. 
Control 6/15, 40%; P=0.73).

Materials and methods: We compared isocaloric diets containing 30% of energy either as AP or PP, using newly developed PP-enriched foods, both combined with 30% energy as fat and 40% as carbohydrates in 44 patients with T2DM over 6 weeks in a randomized parallel-group study. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamps and cardiovascular variables were measured.

Results: Uric acid decreased in both groups, but significantly more in the AP than the PP group. There were no significant differences in other variables, although glycated haemoglobin levels, diastolic blood pressure and fasting non-esterified fatty acid levels improved significantly in the PP but not in the AP group. Insulin sensitivity (M-value), C-reactive protein and fasting glucose improved significantly in the AP but not in the PP group. Total and LDL cholesterol levels and systolic blood pressure decreased significantly in both groups, and the urinary albumin excretion rate decreased from baseline in participants with microalbuminuria.

of condylar liftoff and the location of femorotibial contact from extension 
through midflexion between patients undergoing GB or MR TKA.
METHODS: A total of 24 knees (23 patients) were randomly assigned at referral to

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred patients undergoing laparoscopic RYGB were 
prospectively randomized regarding running enterotomy closure of the linear

created: V-group (VicrylВ® 2/0-Ethicon) and S-group (Stratafixв„ў 2/0-Ethicon). 
Time spent on closing the enterotomies was measured from first needle in until

compartment block (FICB). In addition, the medical records of 28 patients who 
underwent elective THA between May 2015 and December 2015 were retrospectively 
examined. The primary outcome was visual analog scale pain scores and the 
secondary outcomes were LOS and total opioid consumption. SPSS, version 22, was 
used to run 1-way analysis of variance with contrast and Mood's median test on

RESULTS: There were statistically significant decreases in pain intensity (PВ = 
.019) and LOS (PВ = .041) in both the liposomal bupivacaine group and the FICB 
group compared with those in the retrospective control group. In addition, only 
the FICB group showed statistically significant decreased total opioid 
consumption compared with that in the retrospective group (PВ = .028).

increasing focus on clinical outcomes, patient satisfaction, and cost has 
created a need for better acute postoperative pain control for patients. An 
ideal pain control method would have few side effects, decreased opioid 
consumption, improved pain control, early ambulation, and decreased hospital 
length of stay (LOS).
METHODS: We performed a prospective randomized, controlled study involving 79 
patients undergoing elective THA between June 2015 and February 2016. Forty 
patients received liposomal bupivacaine and 39 patients received a fascia iliaca 
compartment block (FICB). In addition, the medical records of 28 patients who

Purpose: To compare the clinical and biological effects of an intra-articular injection of PRP with those of an intra-articular injection of HA in patients with mild to moderate knee OA.

Study design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods: A total of 111 patients with symptomatic unilateral knee OA received a series of either leukocyte-poor PRP or HA injections under ultrasound guidance. Clinical data were collected before treatment and at 4 time points across a 1-year period. Synovial fluid was also collected for analysis of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers before treatment and at 12 and 24 weeks after treatment. Several measures were used to assess results: (1) Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale; (2) International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee evaluation, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, and Lysholm knee score; and (3) difference in intra-articular biochemical marker concentrations.

Results: There were 49 patients randomized to treatment with PRP and 50 randomized to treatment with HA. No difference was seen between the groups in the primary outcome measure (WOMAC pain score). In the secondary outcome measure, linear contrasts identified a significantly higher IKDC score in the PRP group compared with the HA group at 24 weeks (mean ± standard error [SE], 65.5 ± 3.6 vs 55.8 ± 3.8, respectively; P = .013) and at final follow-up (52 weeks) (57.6 ± 3.37 vs 46.6 ± 3.76, respectively; P = .003).

of LB in comparison to a single-shot peripheral nerve block; however, no study 
has investigated LB in a total shoulder arthroplasty population. Therefore, this 
study compared LB vs. an indwelling interscalene nerve block (IINB).
METHODS: This is a prospective, randomized study of 83 consecutive shoulder

Methods: Sixty morbid obese patients (BMI і 35) were evaluated before and after 12 weeks of bariatric surgery in order to compare the impact of two different exercise programs on body composition and functional capacity outcomes. Participants were divided into three groups: aerobic (A), aerobic-strength (AS), and control (C) group. Aerobic capacity was assessed with 12-min walk-run test (12MWRT).

April 2009 through June 2012. All participants had soft tissue ultrasound 
performed at the time of enrollment to exclude abscess. Final follow-up was 
August 2012.
INTERVENTIONS: Cephalexin, 500 mg 4 times daily, plus 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily, for 7 days (nвЂ‰=вЂ‰248

failure criteria at follow-up visits: fever; increase in erythema (>25%), 
swelling, or tenderness (days 3-4); no decrease in erythema, swelling, or 
tenderness (days 8-10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness

(ICUs) at 10 university hospitals in 6 European countries. Three hundred 
fifty-five adult, unconscious patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were 
enrolled from February 16, 2013, to June 1, 2016, with final follow-up on 
December 27, 2016.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to TTM (33вЂ‰В±вЂ‰1В°C) for 48 hours (nвЂ‰=вЂ‰176) 
or 24 hours (nвЂ‰=вЂ‰179), followed by gradual rewarming of 0.5В°C per hour until

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was 6-month neurologic outcome, 
with a Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) score of 1 or 2 used to define 
favorable outcome. Secondary outcomes included 6-month mortality, including time 
to death, the occurrence of adverse events, and intensive care unit resource 
use.
RESULTS: In 355 patients who were randomized (mean age, 60 years; 295 [83%] 
men), 351 (99%) completed the trial. Of these patients, 69% (120/175) in the 
48-hour group had a favorable outcome at 6 months compared with 64% (112/176) in 
the 24-hour group (difference, 4.9%; 95% CI, -5% to 14.8%; relative risk [RR], 
1.08; 95% CI, 0.93-1.25; PвЂ‰=вЂ‰.33). Six-month mortality was 27% (48/175) in the 
48-hour group and 34% (60/177) in the 24-hour group (difference, -6.5%; 95% CI, 
-16.1% to 3.1%; RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.59-1.11; PвЂ‰=вЂ‰.19). There was no significant 
difference in the time to mortality between the 48-hour group and the 24-hour

INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to TTM (33 ± 1°C) for 48 hours (n = 176) 
or 24 hours (n = 179), followed by gradual rewarming of 0.5°C per hour until 
reaching 37°C.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was 6-month neurologic outcome, 
with a Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) score of 1 or 2 used to define 
favorable outcome. Secondary outcomes included 6-month mortality, including time 
to death, the occurrence of adverse events, and intensive care unit resource 
use.
RESULTS: In 355 patients who were randomized (mean age, 60 years; 295 [83%] 
men), 351 (99%) completed the trial. Of these patients, 120/175 (69%) in the 
48-hour group had a favorable outcome at 6 months compared with 112/176 (64%) in 
the 24-hour group (difference, 4.9%; 95% CI, -5% to 14.8%; relative risk [RR], 
1.08; 95% CI, 0.93-1.25; P = .33). Six-month mortality was 48/175 (27%) in the 
48-hour group and 60/177 (34%) in the 24-hour group (difference, -6.5%; 95% CI, 
-16.1% to 3.1%; RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.59-1.11; P = .19). Time to mortality 
between the 48-hour group and the 24-hour group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 
0.54-1.15; P = .22). Adverse events occurred in 97% of the 48-hour group and 91% 
of the 24-hour group (difference, 5.6%; 95% CI, 0.6%-10.6%; RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 
1.01-1.12; P = .04). The median length of intensive care unit stay was 151 hours 
in the 48-hour group versus 117 hours in the 24-hour group (P < .001), and 
hospital stay was 11 versus 12 days (P = .50).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Targeted temperature management at 33°C for 48 hours 
was not more effective on 6-month neurologic outcome than targeted temperature 
management at 33°C for 24 hours in unconscious survivors from out-of-hospital 
cardiac arrest admitted to the ICU.",spin," Yes. The abstract contains spin in the following ways:

cuff repair to improve tendon-bone healing and potentially reduce the incidence 
of subsequent tendon retears.
PURPOSE: To investigate whether the midterm clinical and radiographic outcomes 
of arthroscopic supraspinatus repair are enhanced after repeated postoperative 
applications of PRP.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: A total of 60 patients (30 control; 30 PRP) were initially randomized 
to receive 2 ultrasound-guided injections of PRP to the tendon repair site at 7 
and 14 days after double-row arthroscopic supraspinatus repair or not. A total 
of 55 patients (91.7%) underwent a clinical review and magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) at a mean of 3.5 years after surgery (range, 36-51 months). 
Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) included the Constant score, Quick 
Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH) questionnaire, Oxford 
Shoulder Score (OSS), and visual analog scale (VAS) for pain. Global rating of 
change (GRC) scale and patient satisfaction scores were evaluated. Structural 
integrity of the surgical repair was assessed via MRI using the Sugaya 
classification system.
RESULTS: At the midterm review, there was no difference between the groups for 
any of the PROMs. No differences between the groups were demonstrated for the 
subjective and range of motion subscales of the Constant score. The Constant 
strength subscale score was higher in the PRP group (3.3 points; 95% CI, 1.0-5.7;

30583813,The use of exparel (liposomal bupivacaine) to manage postoperative pain in unilateral total knee arthroplasty patients.,The Journal of Arthroplasty,,Claim equivalence/non-inferiority versus control for a (-) endpoint,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Local periarticular infiltration (PAI) analgesia has emerged as an 
important component of multimodal approaches to treat total knee arthroplasty 
postoperative pain. Liposomal bupivacaine may provide prolonged analgesic 
duration when injected into the surrounding tissues. The purpose of this study 
was to compare the analgesic efficacy and serum bupivacaine levels of a 
continuous femoral nerve block (CFNB) with bupivacaine to PAI with liposomal 
bupivacaine.
METHODS: Sixty-five patients undergoing primary unilateral total knee 
arthroplasty were randomized into 2 groups: (1) CFNB and PAI with bupivacaine 
(CFNB group) or (2) PAI with bupivacaine:liposomal bupivacaine mixture at the 
end of surgery (LB group). The primary outcome was pain intensity at maximum 
knee flexion 24 hours following surgery. Secondary outcomes included pain 
intensities at rest and movement at timed intervals and serum bupivacaine 
levels.
RESULTS: Patients in the CFNB group experienced lower pain scores at maximum 
knee flexion at 24 hours (7.91; 95% confidence interval, 7.19-8.61) compared to 
the LB group (8.95; 95% confidence interval, 8.42-9.48; P = .02). The mean peak 
serum bupivacaine level in the LB group up to 72 hours was 0.55 μg/mL versus 1.4 
μg/mL for CFNB group (P = .0008) with one patient in the CFNB group exceeding 
the reported minimum serum bupivacaine threshold for toxicity.

30583813,The use of exparel (liposomal bupivacaine) to manage postoperative pain in unilateral total knee arthroplasty patients.,The Journal of Arthroplasty,,Claim equivalence/non-inferiority versus control for a (-) endpoint,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Local periarticular infiltration (PAI) analgesia has emerged as an 
important component of multimodal approaches to treat total knee arthroplasty 
postoperative pain. Liposomal bupivacaine may provide prolonged analgesic 
duration when injected into the surrounding tissues. The purpose of this study 
was to compare the analgesic efficacy and serum bupivacaine levels of a 
continuous femoral nerve block (CFNB) with bupivacaine to PAI with liposomal 
bupivacaine.
METHODS: Sixty-five patients undergoing primary unilateral total knee 
arthroplasty were randomized into 2 groups: (1) CFNB and PAI with bupivacaine 
(CFNB group) or (2) PAI with bupivacaine:liposomal bupivacaine mixture at the 
end of surgery (LB group). The primary outcome was pain intensity at maximum 
knee flexion 24В hours following surgery. Secondary outcomes included pain 
intensities at rest and movement at timed intervals and serum bupivacaine 
levels.
RESULTS: Patients in the CFNB group experienced lower pain scores at maximum 
knee flexion at 24В hours (7.91; 95% confidence interval, 7.19-8.61) compared to 
the LB group (8.95; 95% confidence interval, 8.42-9.48; PВ = .02). The mean peak 
serum bupivacaine level in the LB group up to 72В hours was 0.55 Ојg/mL versus 1.4 
Ојg/mL for CFNB group (PВ = .0008) with one patient in the CFNB group exceeding 
the reported minimum serum bupivacaine threshold for toxicity.
CONCLUSION: While similar pain control was observed on the day of surgery for 
both groups, patients with a CFNB experienced lower pain intensities during 
maximum knee flexion at 24В hours. Total serum concentrations in LB group 
remained below the toxicity threshold over the study period.",no_spin, Yes,yes,"[{'token': 29871, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.00014220656885299832, 'probability': 0.9998578429222107}, {'token': 3869, 'token_string': 'Yes', 'logits': -0.00046850196667946875, 'probability': 0.9995315670967102}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.21049290895462036, 'probability': 0.8101848363876343}]"
33332160,Platelet-rich plasma for arthroscopic repair of medium to large rotator cuff tears: a randomized controlled trial.,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,,Claim benefit based on (+) secondary endpoint,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether leukocyte-poor (LP) or leukocyte-rich (LR) 
varieties of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) as an adjuvant to arthroscopic rotator 
cuff repair (ARCR) result in improved tendon healing rates.
PURPOSE: To perform a network meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials 
in the literature to ascertain whether there is evidence to support the use of 
LP- or LR-PRP as an adjunct to ARCR.
METHODS: The literature search was based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Randomized 
controlled trials comparing LP- or LR-PRP with a control alongside ARCR were 
included. Clinical outcomes, including retears and functional outcomes, were 
compared using a frequentist approach to network meta-analysis, with statistical 
analysis performed using R. The treatment options were ranked using the P-score.
RESULTS: There were 13 studies (868 patients) included, with 9 studies comparing 
LP-PRP with a control and 4 studies comparing LR-PRP with a control. LP-PRP was 
found to significantly reduce the rate of retear and/or incomplete tendon 
healing after fixation, even among medium-large tears; it also improved outcomes 
on the visual analog scale for pain, Constant score, and University of 
California Los Angeles score. LP-PRP had the highest P-score for all treatment 
groups. LR-PRP did not result in any significant improvements over the control 
group, except for visual analog scale score for pain. However, post hoc analysis 
revealed that LP-PRP did not lead to significant improvements over LR-PRP in any 
category.
CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrates that LP-PRP reduces the rate of 
retear and/or incomplete tendon healing after ARCR and improves patient-reported 
outcomes as compared with a control. However, it is still unclear whether LP-PRP 
improves the tendon healing rate when compared with LR-PRP.",no_spin, Yes,yes,"[{'token': 29871, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -7.295342220459133e-05, 'probability': 0.9999270439147949}, {'token': 3869, 'token_string': 'Yes', 'logits': -0.0007300095749087632, 'probability': 0.9992702603340149}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.2664985656738281, 'probability': 0.7660570740699768}]"
