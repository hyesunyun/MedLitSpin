18237696,Prospective randomized comparison of anatomic single- and double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy",  Focus on (+) secondary endpoint,,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Purpose
To determine if anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is superior to anatomic single-bundle reconstruction in restoring the stabilities and functions of the knee joint.
Methods
A prospective randomized clinical study was done to compare the results of 32 cases of anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction and 34 cases of anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction with average follow-up of 16.3 В± 3.1В months. Tunnel placements of all the cases were measured on 3D CT. Clinical results were collected after reconstruction; graft's appearance, meniscus status and cartilage state under arthroscopy were compared and analysed too.
Results
Tunnel placements, confirmed with 3D CT, were in the anatomic positions as described in literature both in SB and DB group. No differences were found between SB and DB groups in clinical outcome scores, pivot shift test and KT 1000В measurements (average side-to-side difference for anterior tibial translation was 0.7В mm in SB group and 1.0В mm in DB group). More than 70 % of the single-bundle graft and AM bundle graft in DB group appeared excellent, but only 44.1 % of PL bundle grafts in DB group were excellent and 11.8 % were in poor state. No new menisci tear was found either in SB or DB group, however, in DB group cartilage damages in medial patella-femoral joint occurred in 38.2 % cases. This rate was significantly higher than in the SB group which is only 9.3 %.
Conclusion
Both single- and double-bundle anatomic ACL reconstruction can restore the knee's stability and functions very well. However, more incidences of poor PL status and medial patellar-femoral cartilage damage may occur in double-bundle ACL reconstruction.",no_spin,<|user|>,,"[{'token': 27, 'token_string': '<', 'logits': -1.1641041040420532, 'probability': 0.31220221519470215}, {'token': 91, 'token_string': '|', 'logits': -0.012568079866468906, 'probability': 0.9875105619430542}, {'token': 882, 'token_string': 'user', 'logits': -0.3897861838340759, 'probability': 0.6772016882896423}, {'token': 91, 'token_string': '|', 'logits': -0.004361521918326616, 'probability': 0.9956479072570801}, {'token': 29, 'token_string': '>', 'logits': -0.12153579294681549, 'probability': 0.8855593800544739}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': -0.05242438614368439, 'probability': 0.9489260911941528}]"

Methods: Adult patients treated at one of 3 EDs between November 2010 and September 2011 and prescribed an antibiotic, central nervous system, gastrointestinal, cardiac, or respiratory drug at discharge were eligible. Subjects were randomly assigned to usual care or one of 3 prescription information or services intervention groups: (1) practical services to reduce barriers to prescription filling (practical prescription information or services); (2) consumer drug information from MedlinePlus (MedlinePlus prescription information or services); or (3) both services and information (combination prescription information or services). Self-reported medication adherence, measured by primary adherence (prescription filling) and persistence (receiving medicine as prescribed) rates, was determined during a telephone interview 1 week postdischarge.

Results: Of the 3,940 subjects enrolled and randomly allocated to treatment, 86% (N=3,386) completed the follow-up interview. Overall, primary adherence was 88% and persistence was 48%. Across the sites, primary adherence and persistence did not differ significantly between usual care and the prescription information or services groups.

Methods: Adult patients treated at one of 3 EDs between November 2010 and September 2011 and prescribed an antibiotic, central nervous system, gastrointestinal, cardiac, or respiratory drug at discharge were eligible. Subjects were randomly assigned to usual care or one of 3 prescription information or services intervention groups: (1) practical services to reduce barriers to prescription filling (practical prescription information or services); (2) consumer drug information from MedlinePlus (MedlinePlus prescription information or services); or (3) both services and information (combination prescription information or services). Self-reported medication adherence, measured by primary adherence (prescription filling) and persistence (receiving medicine as prescribed) rates, was determined during a telephone interview 1 week postdischarge.

Results: Of the 3,940 subjects enrolled and randomly allocated to treatment, 86% (N=3,386) completed the follow-up interview. Overall, primary adherence was 88% and persistence was 48%.

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of the two procedures in patients older than 55 years of age affected by reparable rotator cuff tears with concomitant long head biceps pathologies.

Methods: Patients older than 55 years of age with long head biceps lesions and reparable rotator cuff tears were selected for this study. A total of 151 patients were randomly assigned to the tenotomy group (77 patients) or the tenodesis group (74 patients). Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was performed in all the patients. Before surgery, physical and radiological examinations were performed; the constant score was measured as well. After the operation, the surgical time, cost, pain (VAS scores), Popeye sign, cramping pain, constant scores, satisfaction level and the elbow flexion and forearm supination strength indices were recorded.

Results: Patients were followed for an average of 24 months. No significant differences in the clinical results for the constant scores, the forearm supination and elbow flexion strength indices, Popeye sign, cramping pain and satisfaction level were found between the groups.

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of the two procedures in patients older than 55 years of age affected by reparable rotator cuff tears with concomitant long head biceps pathologies.

Methods: Patients older than 55 years of age with long head biceps lesions and reparable rotator cuff tears were selected for this study. A total of 151 patients were randomly assigned to the tenotomy group (77 patients) or the tenodesis group (74 patients). Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was performed in all the patients. The primary outcome was the constant score. Before surgery, physical and radiological examinations were performed; the constant score was measured as well. After the operation, the surgical time, cost, pain (VAS scores), Popeye sign, cramping pain, constant scores, satisfaction level and the elbow flexion and forearm supination strength indices were recorded.

Results: Patients were followed for an average of 24 months. No significant differences in the clinical results for the constant scores, the forearm supination and elbow flexion strength indices, Popeye sign, cramping pain and satisfaction level were found between the groups. Tenotomy required a shorter surgical time (40.4 ± 4.0 vs. 50.4 ± 5.9 min, P < 0.001) and resulted in faster pain relief (3.1 ± 1.8 vs. 4.8 ± 1.9, P < 0.001).

However, there are unanswered questions about the performance of hemiarthroplasty over the longer term compared with internal fixation.

Questions/purposes: We sought to compare hemiarthroplasty with internal fixation in terms of (1) outcomes scores for pain, hip function, and quality of life at a minimum of 5 years after surgery in a randomized trial. A secondary purpose was to compare (2) patient survival and (3) frequency of reoperation in the two groups.

Methods: A total of 222 consecutive patients older than 60 years, including those cognitively impaired, with FNF were randomized to either internal fixation with two parallel screws or bipolar hemiarthroplasty. At a minimum followup of 4.9 years (mean, 5.9 years; range, 4.9-7.2 years), 68 of the 70 surviving patients were examined by a study nurse and study physiotherapist blinded to initial treatment. Questionnaires on hip function (Harris hip score), quality of life (Eq5D), and activity of daily living function (Barthel ADL) were administered. The Barthel ADL index score was split into good function (score 95 or 100) and reduced function (score below 95).

Results: The mean survival of the groups was similar with 66.4% (73 of 110) of the patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty and 70.5% (79 of 112) of the patients undergoing internal fixation having died since surgery (p = 0.51). Only 12 of 31 living patients in the internal fixation group had retained their native hips at a mean of 6 years. Between 2 and 6 years, there were two new major reoperations (both in the internal fixation group, for avascular necrosis and deep wound infection). The mean Harris hip score was 66 (SD 19) and 67 (SD 20) in the internal fixation and hemiarthroplasty groups, respectively (p = 0.96). The mean Eq5D index was 0.50 (SD 0.40) in the internal fixation group and 0.34 (SD 0.36) in the hemiarthroplasty group (p = 0.10). Function in terms of ADLs was comparable between the groups; of the patients in the internal fixation group, 42% reported good function on the Barthel ADL index, and the corresponding number in the hemiarthroplasty group was 51% (p = 0.44).

Most MIS TKA surgeons (and many surgeons who use other approaches as well) excise the fat pad for better exposure of the knee. There is still controversy about the result of fat pad excision on patella baja, pain, and function.

Questions/purposes: In the setting of a randomized controlled trial, we sought to determine whether infrapatellar fat pad excision during MIS TKA causes (1) patellar tendon shortening (as measured by patella baja); (2) increased anterior knee pain; (3) decreases in the Knee Society Score or functional subscore; or (4) more patella-related complications.

Methods: We randomized 90 patients undergoing MIS TKA at one institution into two groups. In one group, 45 patients underwent MIS TKA with complete infrapatellar fat pad excision and in the other group, 45 patients received MIS TKA without infrapatellar fat pad excision. The patella was selectively resurfaced in these patients; there was no difference between the groups in terms of the percentage of patients whose patellae were resurfaced.

ambulatory ability, in-hospital falls). All complications and adverse events 
were recorded.
RESULTS: The frequency of nausea and hypertension was not different between the 
study groups. During the first 12 and 24 postoperative hours, the mean maximum 
VAS pain scores were higher in the ropivacaine group than in the epidural group 
(first 12 hours: 3.93 versus 1.14, respectively, p < 0.0001; 12-24 hours: 3.52 
versus 1.93, respectively, p = 0.008). After 24 hours, pain scores were similar 
between groups. Narcotic consumption was higher in the ropivacaine 
group on the day of surgery, but overall in-hospital narcotic usage was similar 
between groups. There were no differences in functional 
recovery between groups at any time point. Patients in the epidural group 
were more likely to have knee buckling (32.7% versus 6.7%, p = 0.002) and 
delayed ambulation (16.3% versus 0.0%, p = 0.006) than patients in the 
ropivacaine group. No infections occurred in 
either group, and the frequency of complications was not different between 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine was not more effective on analgesic efficacy than epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB in patients undergoing TKA.

continuously infused intraarticular anesthetics remains a controversial topic.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We compared the side effect profile, analgesic efficacy, and 
functional recovery between patients receiving a continuous intraarticular 
infusion of ropivacaine and patients receiving an epidural plus femoral nerve 
block (FNB) after TKA.
METHODS: Ninety-four patients undergoing unilateral TKA were prospectively 
randomized to receive a spinal-epidural analgesic infusion plus a 
single-injection FNB or a spinal anesthetic plus a continuous postoperative 
intraarticular infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine. All patients were blinded to their 
treatment with placebo saline catheters. Blinded coinvestigators collected data 
concerning side effect profiles (nausea, hypotension), analgesic efficacy (VAS 
pain scores, narcotic usage), and functional recovery (timed up and go test, 
quadriceps strength, WOMAC scores, Knee Society scores, early postoperative 
ambulatory ability, in-hospital falls). All complications and adverse events 
were recorded.
RESULTS: The frequency of nausea and hypertension was not different between the 
study groups. During the first 12 and 24 postoperative hours, the mean maximum 
VAS pain scores were higher in the ropivacaine group than in the epidural group 
(first 12 hours: 3.93 versus 1.14, respectively, pВ <В 0.0001; 12-24 hours: 3.52 
versus 1.93, respectively, pВ =В 0.008). After 24 hours, pain scores were similar 
between groups. Narcotic consumption was significantly higher in the ropivacaine 
group on the day of surgery, but overall in-hospital narcotic usage was similar 
between groups. There were no clinically important differences in functional 
recovery between groups at any time point, but patients in the epidural group 
were more likely to have knee buckling (32.7% versus 6.7%, pВ =В 0.002) and 
delayed ambulation (16.3% versus 0.0%, pВ =В 0.006) than patients in the 
ropivacaine group, though not in-hospital falls. No infections occurred in 
either group, and the frequency of complications was not different between 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: A continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine can be 
recommended as a safe, effective alternative to epidural analgesia plus 
single-injection FNB after TKA. Improved analgesic efficacy in the group that 
received epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB must be weighed against 
the disadvantage of a higher likelihood of knee buckling and delayed ambulation 
with that treatment approach.

METHODS: Parents were randomized to receive story booklets (n=208) or standard 
information sheets (n=205) during their ED visit. The primary outcome was change 
in anxiety between triage to ED discharge as measured by the State-Trait Anxiety 
Inventory. Follow-up telephone interviews were conducted at 1 and 3 days after

RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the primary outcome of change in 
parental anxiety between recruitment and ED discharge (change of 5 points for 
the story group vs. 6 points for the comparison group, p=0.78). The story group

emergency, are a form of crisis intervention that aim to mitigate the negative 
consequences of relapse, including hospital admission and use of coercion. Data 
were collected at baseline and 18-months after randomisation. The primary 
outcome was admission to hospital under the Mental Health Act. The economic 
evaluation took a service perspective (health, social care and criminal justice 
services) and a societal perspective (additionally including criminal activity 
and productivity losses).
FINDINGS: The addition of JCPs to TAU had no significant effect on compulsory 
admissions or total societal cost per participant over 18-months follow-up. From 
the service cost perspective, however, evidence suggests a higher probability 
(80%) of JCPs being the more cost-effective option. Exploration by ethnic group 
highlights distinct patterns of costs and effects. Whilst the evidence does not 
support the cost-effectiveness of JCPs for White or Asian ethnic groups, there 
is at least a 90% probability of the JCP intervention being the more 
cost-effective option in the Black ethnic group.
INTERPRETATION: The results by ethnic group are sufficiently striking to warrant 
further investigation into the potential for patient gain from JCPs among black 
patient groups.",no_spin,<|user|>,,"[{'token': 27, 'token_string': '<', 'logits': -1.0416812896728516, 'probability': 0.3528608977794647}, {'token': 91, 'token_string': '|', 'logits': -0.01466882973909378, 'probability': 0.9854382276535034}, {'token': 882, 'token_string': 'user', 'logits': -0.44946831464767456, 'probability': 0.6379672288894653}, {'token': 91, 'token_string': '|', 'logits': -0.0035955561324954033, 'probability': 0.9964108467102051}, {'token': 29, 'token_string': '>', 'logits': -0.06044991686940193, 'probability': 0.9413409233093262}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': -0.047029152512550354, 'probability': 0.9540596008300781}]"

posterior-cruciate-ligament-stabilized (PS) arthroplasties are two major common 
practices in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The hypothesis of the present study

METHODS: In this prospective, randomized study, 100 patients diagnosed with 
primary knee osteoarthritis were randomly assigned to either the PCR group

Although positive effects were found after physiotherapy, the recurrence and prolonged disability of a frozen shoulder are major factors to focus on to provide the appropriate treatment.

Questions/purposes: We wished to study the effectiveness of a shoulder countertraction apparatus on ROM, pain, and function in patients with a frozen shoulder and compare their results with those of control subjects who received conventional physiotherapy.

Methods: A total of 100 participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group and a control group, with each group having 50 participants. The control group received physiotherapy and the experimental group received countertraction and physiotherapy. The total treatment time was 20 minutes a day for 5 days per week for 2 weeks. The outcome measures used were goniometer measurements, VAS, and the Oxford Shoulder Score.

Results: Improvements were seen in the scores for shoulder flexion (94.1Ў ± 19.79Ў at baseline increased to 161.9Ў ± 13.05Ў after intervention), abduction ROM (90.4Ў ± 21.18Ў at baseline increased to 154.8Ў ± 13.21Ў after intervention), and pain (8.00 ± 0.78 at baseline decreased to 3.48 ± 0.71 after intervention) in the experimental group.

Methods: Between January 2007 and January 2011, 87 patients who underwent arthroscopic Bankart repair with the use of knot-tying suture anchors or knotless suture anchors were evaluated, with 45 patients in the knot-tying suture group and 42 patients in the knotless group. Patients were assigned to either group, with odd-numbered patients going to the knot-tying suture arm and even-numbered patients assigned to the knotless arm. Outcomes included the Constant score, the visual analog scale (VAS) score, patient satisfaction score, and range of motion in forward flexion and external rotation with the arm in adduction.

sedation analgesia (SA), titration of ketamine 1 to 2 mg/kg was administered 
intravenously to group 1. Suprascapular nerve block (SNB) was applied under 
ultrasound guidance (USG) to group 2. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay, complications, side 
effects, patient-physician satisfaction, and ease of application. Conformity to normal distribution of 
variables was examined with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The П‡2 test and Fisher 
test were used to evaluate differences between the groups in categorical

24721024,A comparison of suprascapular nerve block and procedural sedation analgesia in shoulder dislocation reduction.,The American Journal of Emergency Medicine,,Claim equivalence/non-inferiority versus control for a (-) endpoint,Emergency Medicine,claude_4.0-sonnet,"OBJECTIVES: Dislocation of the shoulder joint is one of the most common 
dislocations. The reduction procedure is a painful procedure. In this study, 2 
different treatment groups were compared for pain control during shoulder 
dislocation reduction. It was aimed to evaluate the differences between the 
groups in reduction, success, length of hospital stay, complications, side 
effects, patient-physician satisfaction, and ease of application.
METHODS: The study was planned to be prospective and randomized. As procedural 
sedation analgesia (SA), titration of ketamine 1 to 2 mg/kg was administered 
intravenously to group 1. Suprascapular nerve block (SNB) was applied under 
ultrasound guidance (USG) to group 2. Conformity to normal distribution of 
variables was examined with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The П‡2 test and Fisher 
test were used to evaluate differences between the groups in categorical 
variables and the Mann-Whitney U test, and a value of P<.05 was accepted as 
statistically significant.
RESULTS: The study comprised a total of 41 patients; 20 in the group 1 and 21 in 
the group 2. No statistically significant difference was determined between the

METHODS: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was 
conducted in 2 metropolitan EDs in Melbourne, Australia. Eligible patients with 
ED nausea and vomiting were randomized to receive 4 mg intravenous ondansetron, 
20 mg intravenous metoclopramide, or saline solution placebo. Primary outcome 
was mean change in visual analog scale (VAS) rating of nausea severity from 
enrollment to 30 minutes after study drug administration. Secondary outcomes

kinetic chain resistance training on anterior knee laxity and function in the

METHODS: Fifty-eight ACLI subjects were randomised to one of three (12-week 
duration) training groups. The STAND group trained according to a standardised 
rehabilitation protocol. Subjects in the LOW and HIGH group trained as did the 
STAND group but with the addition of seated knee extensor open kinetic chain 
resistance training at loads of 2 sets of 20 repetition maximum (RM) and 20 sets

navigation enables intraoperative control of leg length equalization and offset 
reconstruction. However, the effect of navigation compared with intraoperative

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether intraoperative use of imageless navigation 
(1) improves the relative accuracy of leg length and global and femoral offset 
restoration; (2) increases the absolute precision of leg length and global and 
femoral offset equalization; and (3) reduces outliers in a reconstruction zone

combination of femoral and acetabular offset), and femoral offset differences 
were restored using either navigation or fluoroscopy. Postoperatively, residual 
leg length and global and femoral offset discrepancies were analyzed on 
magnification-corrected radiographs of the pelvis by an independent and blinded 
examiner using digital planning software. Accuracy was defined as the relative 
postoperative difference between the surgically treated and the unaffected 
contralateral side for leg length and offset, respectively; precision was 
defined as the absolute postoperative deviation of leg length and global and 
femoral offset regardless of lengthening or shortening of leg length and offset 
throughout the THA. All analyses were performed per intention-to-treat.
RESULTS: Analyzing the relative accuracy of leg length restoration we found a 
mean difference of 0.2 mm (95% CI, -1.0 to +1.4 mm; p = 0.729) between 
fluoroscopy and navigation, 0.2 mm (95 % CI, -0.9 to +1.3 mm; p = 0.740) for 
global offset and 1.7 mm (95 % CI, +0.4 to +2.9 mm; p = 0.008) for femoral 
offset. For the absolute precision of leg length and global and femoral offset 
equalization, there was a mean difference of 1.7 В± 0.3 mm (p < 0.001) between 
fluoroscopy and navigation. The biomechanical reconstruction with a residual leg 
length and global and femoral offset discrepancy less than 5 mm and less than 8 
mm, respectively, succeeded in 93% and 98%, respectively, in the navigation 
group and in 54% and 95%, respectively, in the fluoroscopy group.

24964886,Fluoroscopy and imageless navigation enable an equivalent reconstruction of leg length and global and femoral offset in THA.,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Restoration of biomechanics is a major goal in THA. Imageless 
navigation enables intraoperative control of leg length equalization and offset 
reconstruction. However, the effect of navigation compared with intraoperative 
fluoroscopy is unclear.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether intraoperative use of imageless navigation 
compared with intraoperative fluoroscopy during minimally invasive (MIS) THA 
with the patient in a lateral decubitus position (1) improves the relative 
accuracy of leg length and global and femoral offset restoration; (2) increases 
the absolute precision of leg length and global and femoral offset equalization; 
and (3) reduces outliers in a reconstruction zone of ± 5 mm for leg length and 
global and femoral offset restoration.
METHODS: In this prospective study a consecutive series of 125 patients were 
randomized to either navigation-guided or fluoroscopy-controlled THA using 
sealed, opaque envelopes. All patients received the same cementless prosthetic 
components through an anterolateral MIS approach while they were in a lateral 
decubitus position. The primary outcome was relative accuracy of leg length 
restoration. Secondary outcomes included global offset accuracy, femoral offset 
accuracy, absolute precision of leg length and offset equalization, and outliers 
in reconstruction zones. Postoperatively, residual leg length and global and 
femoral offset discrepancies were analyzed on magnification-corrected 
radiographs of the pelvis by an independent and blinded examiner using digital 
planning software. Accuracy was defined as the relative postoperative difference 
between the surgically treated and the unaffected contralateral side for leg 
length and offset, respectively; precision was defined as the absolute 
postoperative deviation of leg length and global and femoral offset regardless 
of lengthening or shortening of leg length and offset throughout the THA. All 
analyses were performed per intention-to-treat.
RESULTS: For the primary outcome of relative accuracy of leg length restoration, 
there was a mean difference of 0.2 mm (95% CI, -1.0 to +1.4 mm; p = 0.729) 
between fluoroscopy and navigation. For secondary outcomes, global offset showed 
a mean difference of 0.2 mm (95% CI, -0.9 to +1.3 mm; p = 0.740) and femoral 
offset showed a mean difference of 1.7 mm (95% CI, +0.4 to +2.9 mm; p = 0.008). 
For the absolute precision of leg length and global and femoral offset 
equalization, there was a mean difference of 1.7 ± 0.3 mm (p < 0.001) between

group and 57 in the compression group). The median time to normal painless 
walking was not significantly decreased (P = .16). No significant differences 
were observed in pain, analgesic consumption, and bimalleolar and midfoot

in subjects undergoing assessment for acute angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitor-induced angioedema (ACEIA) in an emergency department (ED).
METHODS: This was a multicenter, phase 2, double-blind study with subjects 
randomized to receive a single subcutaneous dose of ecallantide (10, 30, or 60 
mg) or placebo plus physician-directed conventional therapy. The primary 
endpoint was defined as meeting predetermined discharge eligibility criteria 
within 6 hours of study drug administration. Discharge criteria included 
improvement of edema, stable vital signs, absence of stridor, absence of dyspnea 
or use of accessory muscles during respiration, absence of drooling, and ability 
to drink without difficulty.
RESULTS: An interim analysis showed that a high percentage of subjects met the 
primary endpoint, and the study was halted. Overall, 79 subjects were randomized 
and 76 had data for analysis. Most had mild (45%) or moderate (42%) ACEIA. The 
discharge eligibility endpoint was met by 72% of the placebo group and 85%, 89%,

difference in meeting discharge eligibility endpoint criteria between treatment 
groups was not statistically significant. The incidence of treatment-emergent 
adverse events was similar between placebo and active-treatment groups.
CONCLUSION: The addition of ecallantide to standard therapy does not appear to 
improve angioedema compared with placebo in ED patients with ACEIA. Our data 
suggest that most ED patients presenting with mild to moderate ACEIA are likely 
to meet our discharge eligibility criteria within 6 hours of treatment,

METHODS: Fifty-four patients diagnosed with unilateral painful calcific 
tendinitis were randomly allocated to a US needling or ESWT group. The US 
needling group underwent US-guided needling and received a subacromial 
corticosteroid injection. The ESWT group received ESWT 3 times a week. All

METHODS: The study randomly allocated 32 patients (13 women), mean age 63 years 
(range, 39-82 years), with shoulder osteoarthritis to a Copeland (n = 14) or

randomized into one of six groups: a control group (saline solution, 
epinephrine, and cefazolin, n = 42), Group 1 (ropivacaine, n = 43), Group 2 
(ropivacaine + morphine, n = 43), Group 3 (ropivacaine + ketorolac, n = 42),

12, adverse events, blood eosinophil counts, asthma symptom changes, and health 
care resource utilization.
RESULTS: The proportion of subjects with greater than or equal to 1 asthma 
exacerbation at 12 weeks was not different between placebo and the combined 
benralizumab groups (38.9% vs 33.3%; P = .67). However, compared with placebo, 
benralizumab reduced asthma exacerbation rates by 49% (3.59 vs 1.82; P = .01) 
and exacerbations resulting in hospitalization by 60% (1.62 vs 0.65; P = .02) in 
the combined groups. Benralizumab reduced blood eosinophil counts but did not 
affect other outcomes, while demonstrating an acceptable safety profile.

ganglion block for the treatment of acute anterior headache in the emergency 
department (ED) using a novel noninvasive delivery device.
METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial 
evaluating bupivacaine anesthesia of the sphenopalatine ganglion for acute 
anterior or global-based headache. This study was completed in 2 large academic 
EDs. Bupivacaine or normal saline solution was delivered intranasally (0.3 mL 
per side) with the Tx360 device. Pain and nausea were measured at 0, 5, and 15 
minutes by a 100-mm visual analog scale. The primary endpoint was a 50% 
reduction in pain at 15 minutes. Telephone follow-up assessed 24-hour pain and 
nausea through a 0- to 10-point verbal scale and adverse effects.
RESULTS: The median reported baseline pain in the bupivacaine group was 80 mm 
(IQR 66 mm - 93 mm) and 78.5 mm (IQR 64 mm to 91.75 mm) in the normal saline 
solution group. A 50% reduction in pain was achieved in 48.8% of the bupivacaine

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: From August 2008 to December 2009, a total of 56 consecutive patients

Methods: We performed an institutional review board-approved, randomized, prospective, double-blinded trial at a tertiary, level 1 trauma center. A convenience sample of patients aged 18 to 59 years with acute abdominal, flank, low back, or extremity pain were enrolled. Subjects were consented and randomized to intravenous LDK (0.3mg/kg) or intravenous MOR (0.1mg/kg). Our primary outcome was the maximum change in NRS scores.

25651247,Prehospital use of magnesium sulfate as neuroprotection in acute stroke.,NEJM,"TITLE: Claiming/Insinuating Benefit when none exists, None","Focus on another objective (e.g., trial is (-) but they say they accomplish some goal that they did not prespecify)",Emergency Medicine,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Background: Magnesium sulfate is neuroprotective in preclinical models of stroke and has shown signals of potential efficacy with an acceptable safety profile when delivered early after stroke onset in humans. Delayed initiation of neuroprotective agents has hindered earlier phase 3 trials of neuroprotective agents.

Methods: We randomly assigned patients with suspected stroke to receive either intravenous magnesium sulfate or placebo, beginning within 2 hours after symptom onset. A loading dose was initiated by paramedics before the patient arrived at the hospital, and a 24-hour maintenance infusion was started on the patient's arrival at the hospital. The primary outcome was the degree of disability at 90 days, as measured by scores on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater disability).

Results: Among the 1700 enrolled patients (857 in the magnesium group and 843 in the placebo group), the mean (±SD) age was 69±13 years, 42.6% were women, and the mean pretreatment score on the Los Angeles Motor Scale of stroke severity (range, 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater motor deficits) was 3.7±1.3. The final diagnosis of the qualifying event was cerebral ischemia in 73.3% of patients, intracranial hemorrhage in 22.8%, and a stroke-mimicking condition in 3.9%.

Delayed initiation of neuroprotective agents has hindered earlier phase 3 trials of neuroprotective agents.

Methods: We randomly assigned patients with suspected stroke to receive either intravenous magnesium sulfate or placebo, beginning within 2 hours after symptom onset. A loading dose was initiated by paramedics before the patient arrived at the hospital, and a 24-hour maintenance infusion was started on the patient's arrival at the hospital. The primary outcome was the degree of disability at 90 days, as measured by scores on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater disability).

Results: Among the 1700 enrolled patients (857 in the magnesium group and 843 in the placebo group), the mean (±SD) age was 69±13 years, 42.6% were women, and the mean pretreatment score on the Los Angeles Motor Scale of stroke severity (range, 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater motor deficits) was 3.7±1.3. The final diagnosis of the qualifying event was cerebral ischemia in 73.3% of patients, intracranial hemorrhage in 22.8%, and a stroke-mimicking condition in 3.9%. The median interval between the time the patient was last known to be free of stroke symptoms and the start of the study-drug infusion was 45 minutes (interquartile range, 35 to 62), and 74.3% of patients received the study-drug infusion within the first hour after symptom onset.

Mortality was 15.4% in the magnesium group and 15.5% in the placebo group (P=0.95). No significant between-group differences were noted with respect to all serious adverse events.

To increase the likelihood that good alignment will be achieved during surgery, smart tools such as robotics or patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) have been introduced.
Questions/purposes:В We hypothesized that UKA performed with PSI would result in improved level gait as ascertained with three-dimensional analysis, implant positioning, and patient-reported outcomes measured by a validated scoring system when compared with conventional instrumentation 3 months and 1 year after surgery.
Methods:В We randomized 60 patients into two groups using either the PSI technique or a conventional technique. All patients were operated on using the same technique and the same cemented metal-backed implant. Mean age of the patients was 63 В± 4 years (range, 54-72 years) and mean body mass index was 28 В± 3 kg/m(2). Patients were evaluated preoperatively, at 3 months, and 1 year after surgery by an independent observer blind to the type of technique. Gait parameters were assessed with three-dimensional analysis during level walking preoperatively and at 1 year, frontal and sagittal position of the implant was evaluated on full-length radiographs at 3 months, and subjective functional outcome and quality of life using routine questionnaires (SF-12, new Knee Society Score [KSS], Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) at 3 months and 1 year. This study had 80% power to detect a 15% difference in walking speed at the p < 0.05 level.
Results:В One year after surgery, there were no differences between the two groups in the analyzed gait spatiotemporal parameters, respectively, for PSI UKA and conventional UKA : double limb support 31% (25%-54%) versus 30% (23%-56%; p = 0.67) and walking speed (1.59 m/s [0.86-1.87 m/s] versus 1.57 m/s [0.71-1.96 m/s]; p = 0.41). No difference was observed between the two groups in terms of lower limb alignment (PSI group 178В° В± 3В°, conventional group 178В° В± 4В°; p = 0.24) or implant positioning on mediolateral and anteroposterior radiographs. There were no differences in the functional score between the PSI and conventional TKA groups at 3 months and 1 year after surgery: KSS objective knee scores (PSI: 85 В± 8 points at 3 months, 87 В± 5 points at 1 year and conventional instrumentation: 82 В± 8 points at 3 months 83 В± 6 points at 1 year; p = 0.10) and functional activity scores were similar in both group (PSI: 71 В± 12 points at 3 months and 74 В± 7 points at 1 year versus conventional group: 73 В± 11 points at 3 months and 75 В± 6 at 1 year; p = 0.9).

QT-prolongation. Haloperidol 5 mg or metoclopramide 10 mg was given 
intravenously after 25 mg diphenhydramine. Pain, nausea, restlessness 
(akathisia), and sedation were assessed with 100-mm visual analog scales (VAS) 
at baseline and every 20 min, to a maximum of 80 min. The primary outcome was 
pain relief. The need for rescue medications, side effects, and subject 
satisfaction were recorded. QTc intervals were measured prior to and after 
treatment. Follow-up calls after 48 h assessed satisfaction and recurrent or 
persistent symptoms.
RESULTS: Thirty-one subjects received haloperidol, 33 metoclopramide. The groups 
were similar on all VAS measurements, side effects, and in their satisfaction 
with therapy. Pain relief averaged 53 mm VAS over both groups, with equal times 
to maximum improvement. Subjects receiving haloperidol required rescue 
medication less often (3% vs. 24%, p < 0.02). Mean QTcs were equal 
and normal in the two groups and did not change after treatment. In telephone 
follow-up, 90% of subjects contacted were ""happy with the medication"" they had 
received, with haloperidol-treated subjects experiencing more restlessness (43%

26163281,Clinical performance of lateralized versus non-lateralized reverse shoulder arthroplasty: a prospective randomized study.,Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery,  Focus on (+) subgroup analysis,"""Trend toward significance"" // ""Numerically longer survival"" or equivalent verbiage, Claim benefit based on (+) subgroup analysis",Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) is an established therapeutic 
option in the treatment of cuff tear arthropathy (CTA). Recent studies have 
described a positive effect of lateralization of the center of rotation, 
especially on postoperative rotational function. The goal of this study is to 
compare the outcome of non-lateralized versus lateralized RSA with particular 
regard to rotational function in patients with CTA.
METHODS: Thirty-four patients underwent implantation of RSA either with 
lateralization (nВ =В 17) or without lateralization (nВ =В 17) by use of a 1-cm 
autologous bone graft (""bony increased offset"") of the humeral head for CTA. 
Clinical outcomes were measured with the Constant score; the Disabilities of the 
Arm, Shoulder and Hand score; and the Activities of Daily Living 
RequiringВ External Rotation score, as well as measurement of external rotation 
and determination of the external rotation lag sign with the arm at the side and 
at 90В° of abduction, at 1 year postoperatively and at final follow-up. Computed 
tomography scan evaluation was performed in all patients preoperatively and at 1 
year postoperatively to assess preoperative fatty infiltration of the rotator 
cuff and bony integration of the graft postoperatively.
RESULTS: At final follow-up, all patients showed significantly increased 
functional results. There were no significant differences in the evaluated 
parameters. If patients with degenerative changes of the teres minor were 
excluded, the lateralized group showed significantly increased external 
rotation. Bony integration of the graft could be verified on postoperative 
computed tomography scans in all patients.

Recent studies have described a positive effect of lateralization of the center of rotation, especially on postoperative rotational function. The goal of this study is to compare the outcome of non-lateralized versus lateralized RSA in patients with CTA.

METHODS: Thirty-four patients underwent implantation of RSA either with lateralization (n = 17) or without lateralization (n = 17) by use of a 1-cm autologous bone graft (""bony increased offset"") of the humeral head for CTA. Clinical outcomes were measured with the Constant score; the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score; and the Activities of Daily Living Requiring External Rotation score, as well as measurement of external rotation and determination of the external rotation lag sign with the arm at the side and at 90° of abduction, at 1 year postoperatively and at final follow-up. Computed tomography scan evaluation was performed in all patients preoperatively and at 1 year postoperatively to assess preoperative fatty infiltration of the rotator cuff and bony integration of the graft postoperatively.

RESULTS: At final follow-up, there were no significant differences in the evaluated parameters between the lateralized and non-lateralized groups. Bony integration of the graft could be verified on postoperative computed tomography scans in all patients.

cardiopulmonary adverse events in previous studies and a low incidence of 
intracranial hemorrhage. We sought to describe the neurological and 
cardiopulmonary adverse events in the ALIAS Part 2 Multicenter Trial.
METHODS: Ischemic stroke patients, aged 18-83 and a baseline NIHSS в‰Ґ 6, were 
randomized to treatment with ALB or saline control within 5 hours of stroke 
onset. Neurological adverse events included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, 
hemicraniectomy, neurological deterioration and neurological death. 
Cardiopulmonary adverse events included pulmonary edema/congestive heart 
failure, acute coronary syndromes, atrial fibrillation, pneumonia and pulmonary 
thromboembolism.
RESULTS: Among 830 patients, neurological and cardiopulmonary adverse events 
were not differentially associated with poor outcome between ALB and saline 
control subjects. The rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in the first 
24h was low overall (2.9%, 24/830) but more common in the ALB treated subjects

26410565,Early targeted brain COOLing in the cardiac CATHeterisation laboratory following cardiac arrest (COOLCATH).,Resuscitation,,"""Trend toward nonsignificance"" // ""Numerically longer survival"" or equivalent verbiage",Emergency Medicine,claude_4.0-sonnet,"INTRODUCTION: Trials demonstrate significant clinical benefit in patients 
receiving therapeutic hypothermia (TH) after cardiac arrest. However, incidence 
of mortality and morbidity remains high in this patient group. Rapid targeted 
brain hypothermia induction, together with prompt correction of the underlying 
cause may improve outcomes in these patients. This study investigates the 
efficacy of Rhinochill, an intranasal cooling device over Blanketrol, a surface 
cooling device in inducing TH in cardiac arrest patients within the cardiac 
catheter laboratory.
METHODS: 70 patients were randomized to TH induction with either Rhinochill or 
Blanketrol. Primary outcome measures were time to reach tympanic в‰¤34 В°C from 
randomisation as a surrogate for brain temperature and oesophageal в‰¤34 В°C from 
randomisation as a measurement of core body temperature. Secondary outcomes 
included first hour temperature drop, length of stay in intensive care unit, 
hospital stay, neurological recovery and all-cause mortality at hospital 
discharge.
RESULTS: There was no difference in time to reach в‰¤34 В°C between Rhinochill and 
Blanketrol (Tympanic в‰¤34 В°C, 75 vs. 107 mins; p=0.101; Oesophageal в‰¤34 В°C, 85 
vs. 115 mins; p=0.151). Tympanic temperature dropped significantly with 
Rhinochill in the first hour (1.75 vs. 0.94 В°C; p<0.001). No difference was 
detected in any other secondary outcome measures. Catheter laboratory-based TH 
induction resulted in a survival to hospital discharge of 67.1%.
CONCLUSION: In this study, Rhinochill was not found to be more efficient than

26410565,Early targeted brain COOLing in the cardiac CATHeterisation laboratory following cardiac arrest (COOLCATH).,Resuscitation,,"""Trend toward nonsignificance"" // ""Numerically longer survival"" or equivalent verbiage",Emergency Medicine,claude_4.0-sonnet,"INTRODUCTION: Trials demonstrate significant clinical benefit in patients 
receiving therapeutic hypothermia (TH) after cardiac arrest. However, incidence 
of mortality and morbidity remains high in this patient group. This study 
investigates the efficacy of Rhinochill, an intranasal cooling device over 
Blanketrol, a surface cooling device in inducing TH in cardiac arrest patients 
within the cardiac catheter laboratory.
METHODS: 70 patients were randomized to TH induction with either Rhinochill or 
Blanketrol. Primary outcome measures were time to reach tympanic ≤34 °C from 
randomisation as a surrogate for brain temperature and oesophageal ≤34 °C from 
randomisation as a measurement of core body temperature. Secondary outcomes 
included first hour temperature drop, length of stay in intensive care unit, 
hospital stay, neurological recovery and all-cause mortality at hospital 
discharge.
RESULTS: There was no difference in time to reach ≤34 °C between Rhinochill and 
Blanketrol (Tympanic ≤34 °C, 75 vs. 107 mins; p=0.101; Oesophageal ≤34 °C, 85 
vs. 115 mins; p=0.151). Tympanic temperature dropped with Rhinochill in the 
first hour (1.75 vs. 0.94 °C; p<0.001). No difference was detected in any other 
secondary outcome measures. Catheter laboratory-based TH induction resulted in a 
survival to hospital discharge of 67.1%.
CONCLUSION: Rhinochill was not more effective than Blanketrol for TH induction

However, there are few well-designed studies comparing approaches to treatment.

Questions/purposes: (1) Which treatment (compression bandaging with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], aspiration, or aspiration with steroid injections) is associated with the highest likelihood of resolution of nonseptic olecranon bursitis? (2) Which treatment is associated with earliest resolution of symptoms? (3) What factors are associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks?

Methods: We enrolled 133 patients from two centers; after applying prespecified exclusions (septic bursitis or concomitant inflammatory arthritis, intraarticular elbow pathology, recent aspiration or steroid injection done elsewhere, and refusal to participate), 90 patients were randomly allocated to receive compression bandaging with NSAIDs (C), aspiration (A), or aspiration with steroid injection (AS) groups (30 patients in each). The groups were similar at baseline in terms of age and gender. Seven patients (four from Group A and three from Group AS) were lost to followup. All patients were followed up weekly for 4 weeks, and the same treatment procedure was repeated if the bursitis recurred with any substantial fluid collection. At 4 weeks, the state of resolution and pain visual analog scale (VAS) were evaluated. Failed resolution was defined as presence of persistent olecranon bursal fluid collection at Week 4 after the initiation of the treatment; on the contrary, if bursal fluid collection was clinically reduced or completely disappeared by the end of Week 4, the treatment was considered successful. We compared the proportion of resolution by Week 4 and the median times to resolution among the treatment groups. In addition, we evaluated whether the resolution affected pain VAS and what factors were associated with the resolution.

Results: There were no differences in the proportion of patients whose bursitis resolved by Week 4 among the three treatment groups (Group C: 25 of 30 [83%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.27-1.72], p = 0.580; Group A: 17 of 26 [65%], relative risk of resolution failure: 2.19 [95% CI, 0.98-4.87], p = 0.083; Group AS: 23 of 27 [85%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.59 [95% CI, 0.22-1.63], p = 0.398) (p = 0.073). Steroid injection after aspiration (Group AS) was associated with the earliest resolution (2.3 weeks [range, 1-4 weeks]) when compared with aspiration alone (Group A; 3.1 weeks [range, 2-4 weeks]) and compression bandaging with NSAIDs (Group C; 3.2 weeks [range, 2-4 weeks]), p = 0.015). Longer duration of symptoms before treatment was the only factor associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks (failed resolution: 6 weeks [range, 2-9 weeks]; successful resolution: 4 weeks [range, 0.4-6 weeks]; p = 0.008).

Conclusions: With the numbers available, there were no differences in efficacy when compression bandaging with NSAIDs, aspiration, and aspiration with steroid injection were compared. However, we were powered only to detect a 30% difference, meaning that if there were a smaller difference in efficacy among the groups, we might not have detected it in a study of this size. Our data can be used as pilot data to power future prospective (and likely multicenter) trials. Because olecranon bursitis can recur, and because treatments like aspiration and aspiration with steroid injection can cause complications, unless future trials demonstrate clear efficacy advantages of aspiration and/or injection both at short and longer terms, we suggest that compression bandaging and a short course of NSAIDs may offer the most appropriate balance of safety and efficacy.",no_spin,<|user|>,,"[{'token': 27, 'token_string': '<', 'logits': -0.7880284786224365, 'probability': 0.4547404646873474}, {'token': 91, 'token_string': '|', 'logits': -0.010887504555284977, 'probability': 0.9891716241836548}, {'token': 882, 'token_string': 'user', 'logits': -0.47030961513519287, 'probability': 0.6248087882995605}, {'token': 91, 'token_string': '|', 'logits': -0.0043871584348380566, 'probability': 0.9956223964691162}, {'token': 29, 'token_string': '>', 'logits': -0.1106962338089943, 'probability': 0.8952106237411499}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': -0.06229809671640396, 'probability': 0.9396027326583862}]"

Our hypothesis was that there would be no differences in joint line angles or correction accuracy between the two groups, that patellar height would increase after CW HTO and decrease after OW HTO, and that leg length and posterior tibial slope would decrease after CW HTO and increase after OW HTO.

Methods: Radiological data were collected from 70 patients participating in an ongoing prospective randomized clinical trial comparing OW and CW HTOs. Digital standing hip-knee-ankle (HKA) radiographs as well as lateral radiographs in 30Ў of flexion were obtained preoperatively and at 6 months for each patient. Joint line angles, HKA angle, leg length, Insall-Salvati index, Miura-Kawamura index and posterior tibial slope were measured using medical planning software. The complete preoperative radiological examinations of the first 50 patients were used in a study of intra- and inter-rater reliability of the measurements.

Results: The mean posterior slope was reduced by 2.5Ў in CW HTO, whereas it remained unchanged in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Mean leg length decreased 5.7 mm in CW HTO and increased 3.1 mm in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Changes in joint line angles, patellar height indexes and the correction accuracy showed no significant differences comparing the two techniques. Frontal plane reliability measurement intra- and inter-rater intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) varied from 0.81 to 0.99. Sagittal plane intra- and inter-rater ICC varied from 0.60 to 0.87. Posterior tibial slope intra- and inter-rater ICC showed the lowest values (0.70 and 0.60, respectively) corresponding to a smallest real difference of 4.5Ў and 5.5Ў, respectively.

Conclusions: Posterior tibial slope and leg length changes were significantly different in CW compared to OW HTOs.

with a relative risk of 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77 to 1.19). 
Secondary outcomes were similar in both groups (P>.05 for all comparisons). 
Hospital mortality occurred in 6 patients (9.8%) each in the intervention and 
control groups on or before 28 days (relative risk=1.00; 95% CI 0.34 to 2.93). 
Among a subgroup of patients with underlying fluid overload states, those in the 
intervention group tended to receive clinically significantly more intravenous 
fluids at 3 hours (difference=975 mL; 95% CI -450 to 1,725 mL) and attained 
better lactate clearance (difference=19.7%; 95% CI -34.6% to 60.2%) compared 
with the control group, with shorter hospital lengths of stay (difference=-4.5 
days; 95% CI -9.5 to 2.5 days).
CONCLUSION: Protocol-based fluid resuscitation of patients with severe sepsis 
and septic shock with the noninvasive cardiac output monitor and passive 
leg-raising maneuver did not result in better outcomes compared with usual care. 
Future studies to demonstrate the use of the noninvasive protocol-based care in 
patients with preexisting fluid overload states may be warranted.",no_spin,<|user|>,,"[{'token': 27, 'token_string': '<', 'logits': -0.8175690174102783, 'probability': 0.441503643989563}, {'token': 91, 'token_string': '|', 'logits': -0.014144173823297024, 'probability': 0.9859554171562195}, {'token': 882, 'token_string': 'user', 'logits': -0.5753194093704224, 'probability': 0.56252521276474}, {'token': 91, 'token_string': '|', 'logits': -0.004715156741440296, 'probability': 0.9952959418296814}, {'token': 29, 'token_string': '>', 'logits': -0.07097945362329483, 'probability': 0.9314810633659363}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': -0.06711141020059586, 'probability': 0.935090959072113}]"

A Randomized Controlled Trial.,The Journal of Arthroplasty,,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Background:В Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is associated with substantial blood loss in postoperative period. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is potent antifibrinolytic agent, routinely administered by intravenous (IV) and topical route, which can possibly interrupt cascade of events due to hemostatic irregularities close to source of bleeding. However, scientific evidence of combined administration of TXA in TKA is still meagre. The present study aimed to compare efficacy of combined IV and topical TXA with IV use alone in terms of blood loss, transfusion rate, and incidence of deep vein thrombosis and thromboembolism.
Patients and methods:В 119 patients undergoing unilateral TKA were randomized into IV alone and combined group. Patients assigned to IV group were given IV TXA as a preoperative and postoperative dose given 3 and 6 hours after surgery, whereas in combined group, topical TXA solution was applied intraarticularly about 5 minutes before closure of arthrotomy in addition to IV doses.
Results:В Combined use of IV and topical TXA provided better results than IV use alone with mean calculated total blood loss (590.69В±191.1 vs 385.68В±182.5, P<.001), blood transfusion rate (6.6% vs 1.6%, P = .364), hemoglobin drop (1.82В±0.6 vs 1.14В±0.5, P<.001).

Objective: To test the hypothesis that high-intensity endurance training (ET) is superior to moderate-intensity ET for improving risk factors for type 2 diabetes in overweight adolescents.

Design and methods: In this randomized trial, 106 overweight and obese adolescents (15.2 years; 76% female; 62% Caucasian) were randomly assigned to high-intensity ET (70-85% of heart rate reserve, n=38), moderate-intensity ET (40-55% heart rate reserve; n=32) or control for 6 months (n=36). The primary and secondary outcome measures were insulin sensitivity assessed using a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test and hepatic triglyceride content with magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Exploratory outcomes were cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity and MRI and dual x-ray absorptiometry-derived measures of adiposity.

Results: The study had 96% retention and attendance was 61±21% and 55±24% in the high- and moderate-intensity ET arms.

26775091,"Rotator cuff healing after needling of a calcific deposit using platelet-rich plasma augmentation: a randomized, prospective clinical trial.",Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery,  Other,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Arthroscopic needling of a rotator cuff calcification is a highly 
reliable operation in terms of pain relief and return of function. However, 
during the needling process, a cuff defect is created. Little is known about the 
evolution of this defect.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial to 
investigate the evolution of the aforementioned defect and the role of 
platelet-rich plasma (PRP) augmentation in this healing process. Patients were 
randomized to either group 1 (PRP, nвЂ‰=вЂ‰20) or group 2 (no PRP [control group], 
nвЂ‰=вЂ‰20). Patients in group 1 received a perioperative PRP infiltration at the 
rotator cuff defect, whereas the control group did not. Patients were assessed 
clinically preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and 1 
year. The Constant score, Simple Shoulder Test, and QuickDASH (short version of 
Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire) were used as outcome 
measures. The evolution of the cuff defect was evaluated on sonography at 3 and 
6 months and with magnetic resonance imaging after 1 year.
RESULTS: All patients improved significantly after surgery (PвЂ‰<вЂ‰.05). There was 
no difference in clinical outcome or rotator cuff healing between groups. We 
observed a high rate of persistent rotator cuff defects after 1 year in both 
groups. The presence of residual cuff defects did not influence the clinical 
outcome.

reliable operation in terms of pain relief and return of function. However, 
during the needling process, a cuff defect is created. Little is known about the 
evolution of this defect.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial to 
investigate the evolution of the aforementioned defect and the role of 
platelet-rich plasma (PRP) augmentation in this healing process. The primary 
outcome was rotator cuff healing. Patients were randomized to either group 1 
(PRP, n = 20) or group 2 (no PRP [control group], n = 20). Patients in group 1 
received a perioperative PRP infiltration at the rotator cuff defect, whereas 
the control group did not. Patients were assessed clinically preoperatively and 
postoperatively at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and 1 year. The Constant score, 
Simple Shoulder Test, and QuickDASH (short version of Disabilities of the Arm, 
Shoulder and Hand questionnaire) were used as secondary outcome measures. The 
evolution of the cuff defect was evaluated on sonography at 3 and 6 months and 
with magnetic resonance imaging after 1 year.
RESULTS: There was no difference in rotator cuff healing between groups. We 
observed a high rate of persistent rotator cuff defects after 1 year in both 
groups. There was no difference in clinical outcome between groups. The presence 
of residual cuff defects did not influence the clinical outcome.
CONCLUSION: PRP was not more effective than no PRP on rotator cuff healing in

effectiveness of SRS reapplication after draping to reduce the incidence of SSI

METHODS: Six hundred patients undergoing primary TJA between 2010 and 2011 at a 
single institution were recruited and randomly assigned to one of 2 groups. The 
patients in the intervention group (nВ = 300) received SPS that included alcohol

the patients in the control group (nВ = 300) received a single SPS with alcohol

envelope, and the rates of SSI and blistering were compared between groups.
RESULTS: Five seventy-seven patients completed the study and were included in

We examined whether a novel suspended release local anesthetic, liposomal bupivacaine (LB) would improve pain control and decrease opioid consumption after TKA compared to a standard periarticular injection in opioid-dependent patients.

Methods: Thirty-eight patients undergoing TKA were randomly assigned to receive either a periarticular injection (PAI) with LB (n = 20) or with a standard PAI (including a combination of ropivacaine, clonidine, Toradol, Epinepherine, and saline; n = 18) as part of a multimodal pain management approach.

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled study; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: Between August 2007 and March 2014, a total of 82 patients who 
underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of a delaminated tear were enrolled 
and randomized into 2 groups. In group 1 (n = 48), arthroscopic conventional en 
masse repair was performed. In group 2 (n = 34), separate double-layer 
double-row repair was performed. The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, 
Constant score, Simple Shoulder Test score, visual analog scale (VAS) score 
for pain, and range of motion (ROM) were assessed before surgery; at 3, 6, and 12 
months after surgery; and at the last follow-up visit. Magnetic resonance

rate and pattern.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference between groups in the preoperative 
demographic data, including patient age, sex, symptom duration, tear size, and 
functional scores (P > .05). The mean follow-up period was 25.9 ± 1.2 months. 
No significant differences in functional scores and ROM were found between the 2

METHODS: Between August 2007 and March 2014, a total of 82 patients who 
underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of a delaminated tear were enrolled 
and randomized into 2 groups. In group 1 (n = 48), arthroscopic conventional en 
masse repair was performed. In group 2 (n = 34), separate double-layer 
double-row repair was performed. The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, 
Constant score, Simple Shoulder Test score, and visual analog scale (VAS) score 
for pain and range of motion (ROM) were assessed before surgery; at 3, 6, and 12 
months after surgery; and at the last follow-up visit. Magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) was performed at 12 months postoperatively to examine the retear 
rate and pattern.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference between groups in the preoperative 
demographic data, including patient age, sex, symptom duration, tear size, and 
functional scores (P > .05). The mean follow-up period was 25.9 В± 1.2 months. 
Significant improvements in functional and pain scores were observed in both 
groups at the last follow-up visit. However, no significant differences in 
functional scores and ROM were found between the 2 groups at each time point, 
except that group 2 had significantly lower VAS pain scores (P < .05) at 3, 6, 
and 12 months postoperatively. Eight (17%) of 48 patients in group 1 and 6 (18%) 
of 34 patients in group 2 showed retears on MRI at 12-month follow-up (P > .05).
CONCLUSION: Both conventional en masse repair and separate double-layer 
double-row repair were effective in improving clinical outcomes in the treatment 
of delaminated rotator cuff tears. Lower pain scores were seen in patients who 
underwent separate double-layer double-row repair.",no_spin,<|user|>,,"[{'token': 27, 'token_string': '<', 'logits': -1.0066142082214355, 'probability': 0.36545419692993164}, {'token': 91, 'token_string': '|', 'logits': -0.015659814700484276, 'probability': 0.9844621419906616}, {'token': 882, 'token_string': 'user', 'logits': -0.5714435577392578, 'probability': 0.5647096633911133}, {'token': 91, 'token_string': '|', 'logits': -0.004802834242582321, 'probability': 0.9952086806297302}, {'token': 29, 'token_string': '>', 'logits': -0.0544484406709671, 'probability': 0.9470073580741882}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': -0.07820648699998856, 'probability': 0.9247735142707825}]"

labrum-biceps complex (SLBC) lesions and rotator cuff tears who underwent

(simple debridement, biceps tenotomy, or biceps tenodesis) for the SLBC lesions.
METHODS: One hundred twenty patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff 
repair with SLBC lesions (biceps partial tears <50%, partial pulley lesions, and 
type II SLAP lesions) were enrolled in this prospective comparative study and 
randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups (simple debridement [Deb], biceps 
tenotomy only [BTo], or biceps tenodesis with one suture anchor [BTd]). Patients 
with isolated subscapularis tears or osteoarthritis were excluded. Finally, 86 
patients (Deb in 28, BTo in 27, and BTd in 31) were analyzed (mean follow-up, 
22.1 ± 7.72 months; mean age, 58.98 ± 7.8 years). Pain; functional, clinical, 
and radiologic outcomes; and the strength index of elbow flexion and forearm 
supination were analyzed.
RESULTS: Pain, range of motion, and functional scores improved postoperatively 
in all 3 groups, with no significant differences across groups. At the 6-month 
follow-up, 8 patients reported cramping pain (5 Deb patients, 2 BTo patients,

knee functional outcome. The assessed outcomes included total blood loss, number 
of transfusions, fever and wound complication rate at 24 months follow-up. In 
addition, the change in knee society score at 12 weeks postoperatively was

significantly less in the no-drain group with an average of 0.15 unit/patient as 
compared to an average 0.37 unit/patient for the drain group (P value=0.0432).

The aim of this study was to determine whether there are middle-term differences in knee function and pain in patients undergoing fixed- and mobile-bearing total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

Methods: Eligible patients were randomized into two groups: the first group received TKA implantation with a fixed tibial platform (group A); the second group received TKA with a mobile tibial platform (group B).

Results: There were no significant differences in function and symptoms in the ADLS and VAS between the study groups.

Conclusion: The type of platform used in TKA (fixed vs. mobile) does not change the symptoms, function or pain of patients 2 years post-surgery.

established as a standard treatment for large full-thickness cartilage defects, 
the effect of different doses of autologous chondrocyte products on structural 
outcomes has never been examined.
HYPOTHESIS: In ACI, the dose level may have an influence on medium-term magnetic 
resonance morphological findings after treatment.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: A total of 75 patients who underwent ACI using a pure, autologous, 
third-generation matrix-associated ACI product were divided into 3 groups 
representing different doses: 3 to 7 spheroids/cm(2), 10 to 30 spheroids/cm(2), 
and 40 to 70 spheroids/cm(2). Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 1.5, 
3, 6, and 12 months after ACI and was evaluated by the magnetic resonance 
observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score and the Knee injury and 
Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS).
RESULTS: MOCART scores showed improvements after 3 months, with slight dose 
dependence, and further improvement after 12 months, although without 
significant dose dependence. The mean MOCART scores after 3 months (0 = worst, 
100 = best) were 59.8, 64.5, and 64.7 for the low-, medium-, and high-dose 
groups, respectively, and 62.9 for all patients; at 12 months, these were 74.1, 
74.5, and 68.8 for the respective dose groups and 72.4 for all patients. Several 
MOCART items (surface of repair tissue, structure of repair tissue, signal 
intensity of repair tissue, subchondral bone, and synovitis) showed a more rapid 
response with the medium and high doses than with the low dose, suggesting a 
potential dose relationship. No significant correlation between the MOCART 
(overall and subscores) with clinical outcomes as assessed by the overall KOOS 
was detected at 3- and 12-month assessments.
CONCLUSION: This study reveals a trend toward earlier recovery after treatment 
with higher spheroid doses in terms of better defect filling for full-thickness 
cartilage defects of the knee, while outcomes after 12 months were similar in 
all dose groups. However, a correlation with clinical outcomes or the failure 
rate at 1 year after ACI was not found. A longer follow-up will be required for 
more definite conclusions on the clinical relevance of ACI cell density to be 
drawn.

(overall and subscores) with clinical outcomes as assessed by the overall KOOS 
was detected at 3- and 12-month assessments.
CONCLUSION: Higher spheroid doses were not more effective than lower spheroid

This study compared the outcomes of tenotomy with outcomes of tenodesis for treatment of LHBT lesions with rotator cuff tears.

Methods: The study enrolled 128 patients with LHBT lesions and small- to medium-sized rotator cuff tear. Arthroscopic LHBT tenotomy was done in 56 patients (group I), and LHBT tenodesis was done for 72 patients (group II) with rotator cuff repair. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Score, simple shoulder test, pain visual analog scale, range of motion, and cosmetic changes were assessed initially, at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively, and the last visit.

patients is under debate.
PURPOSE: To compare clinical outcomes and calf muscle strength recovery after 
the nonsurgical treatment and open surgical repair of acute Achilles tendon 
ruptures with identical accelerated rehabilitation programs.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: From 2009 to 2013, a total of 60 patients with an acute Achilles tendon 
rupture were randomized to surgery or nonsurgical treatment. Nonsurgical 
treatment included first a week of cast immobilization, followed by a functional 
orthosis for 6 weeks, allowing full weightbearing after week 1 and active 
plantar flexion after week 5. Surgery was simple end-to-end open repair, and 
postoperative treatment was identical to nonsurgical treatment. The primary outcome 
was the Leppilahti Achilles tendon performance score. Secondary outcomes included 
isokinetic calf muscle strength and RAND 36-Item Health Survey at 18-month follow-up.
RESULTS: At 18-month follow-up, the mean Leppilahti score was 79.5 and 75.7 for 
the surgically and nonsurgically treated groups, respectively (mean difference, 
3.8; 95% CI, -1.9 to 9.5; P = .19). Angle-specific peak torque results of 
affected legs at 18 months showed a 14% difference in the peak torque of the 
affected leg favoring the surgical group versus the nonsurgical group (mean peak 
torque, 110.3 vs 96.5 N·m, respectively; mean difference, 13.6 N·m; 95% CI, 
2.0-25.1 N·m; P = .022). The RAND 36-Item Health Survey indicated differences 
in the domains of physical functioning (P = .006) and bodily pain (P = .037) 
for surgically treated patients.
CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment was not more effective than nonsurgical treatment 
on the Leppilahti Achilles tendon performance score in patients with acute 
Achilles tendon ruptures.

but surgery restores calf muscle strength earlier over the entire range of 
motion of the ankle joint, with a 10% to 18% strength difference favoring 
surgery at 18 months. Surgery may also result in better health-related quality 
of life in the domains of physical functioning and bodily pain compared with 
nonsurgical treatment.

27339124,No Difference in Early Analgesia Between Liposomal Bupivacaine Injection and Intrathecal Morphine After TKA.,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,  Other,"""Trend toward significance"" // ""Numerically longer survival"" or equivalent verbiage",Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Background: Opioid analgesics have been a standard modality for postoperative pain management after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) but are also associated with increased risk of nausea, pruritus, vomiting, respiratory depression, prolonged ileus, and cognitive dysfunction. There is still a need for a method of anesthesia that can deliver effective long-term postoperative pain relief without incurring the high cost and health burden of opioids and nerve blocks.

Questions/purposes: (1) Is liposomal bupivacaine-based periarticular injection (PAI) more effective than morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA? (2) Do patients treated with liposomal bupivacaine-based PAI experience fewer opioid-related adverse events compared with patients treated with morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA?

Methods: This multicenter, blind trial randomized 119 patients undergoing TKA with spinal anesthesia to receive spinal anesthesia plus periarticular injection with liposomal bupivacaine (40 patients), spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine plus intrathecal morphine (41 patients) but no liposomal bupivacaine injection, or spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine (38 patients) and no liposomal bupivacaine injection. The two groups that did not receive periarticular liposomal bupivacaine did receive periarticular injection with ropivacaine, and all three groups had ketorolac (30 mg) plus epinephrine (1:1000) in the periarticular injections. Patients in all three groups received identical perioperative multimodal analgesic and antiemetic drugs. All patients were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized and no patients were lost to followup. The primary study endpoints were visual analog score (VAS) for pain and narcotic use during postoperative day 1. Secondary endpoints included side effects associated with narcotic administration during the hospital stay.

Results: Mean VAS pain in the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group was lower than that for the ropivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (1.8 ± 2.1 versus 3.3 ± 2.3, p = 0.005, mean difference: 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-2.5) and 12 hours (1.5 ± 2.0 versus 3.3 ± 2.4, p < 0.001, mean difference: 1.8, 95% CI, 0.8-2.8) after surgery. The morphine spinal group had lower pain compared with the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (0.9 ± 1.8 versus 1.8 ± 2.1, p = 0.035, mean difference: 1.0, 95% CI, 0.1-1.8), but there was no difference at 12 hours (0.8 ± 1.5 versus 1.5 ± 2.0, p = 0.086, mean difference: 0.7, 95% CI, -0.1 to 1.5).

27339124,No Difference in Early Analgesia Between Liposomal Bupivacaine Injection and Intrathecal Morphine After TKA.,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,  Other,"""Trend toward significance"" // ""Numerically longer survival"" or equivalent verbiage",Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Background: Opioid analgesics have been a standard modality for postoperative pain management after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) but are also associated with increased risk of nausea, pruritus, vomiting, respiratory depression, prolonged ileus, and cognitive dysfunction. There is still a need for a method of anesthesia that can deliver effective long-term postoperative pain relief without incurring the high cost and health burden of opioids and nerve blocks.

Questions/purposes: (1) Is liposomal bupivacaine-based periarticular injection (PAI) more effective than morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA? (2) Do patients treated with liposomal bupivacaine-based PAI experience fewer opioid-related adverse events compared with patients treated with morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA?

Methods: This multicenter, blind trial randomized 119 patients undergoing TKA with spinal anesthesia to receive spinal anesthesia plus periarticular injection with liposomal bupivacaine (40 patients), spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine plus intrathecal morphine (41 patients) but no liposomal bupivacaine injection, or spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine (38 patients) and no liposomal bupivacaine injection. The two groups that did not receive periarticular liposomal bupivacaine did receive periarticular injection with ropivacaine, and all three groups had ketorolac (30 mg) plus epinephrine (1:1000) in the periarticular injections. Patients in all three groups received identical perioperative multimodal analgesic and antiemetic drugs. All patients were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized and no patients were lost to followup. The primary study endpoints were visual analog score (VAS) for pain and narcotic use during postoperative day 1. Secondary endpoints included side effects associated with narcotic administration during the hospital stay.

Results: Mean VAS pain in the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group was lower than that for the ropivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (1.8 ± 2.1 versus 3.3 ± 2.3, p = 0.005, mean difference: 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-2.5) and 12 hours (1.5 ± 2.0 versus 3.3 ± 2.4, p < 0.001, mean difference: 1.8, 95% CI, 0.8-2.8) after surgery. The morphine spinal group had lower pain compared with the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (0.9 ± 1.8 versus 1.8 ± 2.1, p = 0.035, mean difference: 1.0, 95% CI, 0.1-1.8), but there was no difference at 12 hours (0.8 ± 1.5 versus 1.5 ± 2.0, p = 0.086, mean difference: 0.7, 95% CI, -0.1 to 1.5). The magnitude of the differences at 6 and 12 hours are near the lower end of minimal clinically important differences reported in the literature, and thus the improvement shown in this study may only represent a small clinical improvement. Both the liposomal bupivacaine group (13% [five of 40]) and the ropivacaine group (5% [two of 38]) had fewer incidents of itching (pruritus) than the spinal morphine group (38% [15 of 41]) (p = 0.001).

Conclusions: This prospective multicenter three-arm blind randomized controlled trial showed potentially improved pain control at 6 and 12 hours in the liposomal bupivacaine and intrathecal morphine groups compared with the ropivacaine group at the cost of much higher incidences of pruritus (itching) in the intrathecal morphine group. Based on these results, we prefer the use of PAI with liposomal bupivacaine as an alternative to spinal anesthesia with intrathecal morphine as a result of similar postoperative pain control and the potential for reducing adverse events.",no_spin,<|user|>,,"[{'token': 27, 'token_string': '<', 'logits': -0.952521562576294, 'probability': 0.38576701283454895}, {'token': 91, 'token_string': '|', 'logits': -0.015502308495342731, 'probability': 0.9846172332763672}, {'token': 882, 'token_string': 'user', 'logits': -0.4191031754016876, 'probability': 0.6576363444328308}, {'token': 91, 'token_string': '|', 'logits': -0.004488987382501364, 'probability': 0.9955211281776428}, {'token': 29, 'token_string': '>', 'logits': -0.06378515064716339, 'probability': 0.9382064938545227}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': -0.07723875343799591, 'probability': 0.9256687760353088}]"

(DB) ACLR with a hamstring tendon autograft versus irradiated allograft are 
rare.
PURPOSE: To compare the clinical outcomes of arthroscopic anatomic DB ACLR with 
a hamstring tendon autograft versus irradiated allograft.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: Between 2008 and 2009, a total of 107 patients undergoing arthroscopic 
DB ACLR were prospectively randomized consecutively into 1 of 2 groups 
(autograft [Auto] group and irradiated allograft [Ir-Allo] group). All the 
surgical procedures were performed by the same senior surgeon using the DB 
reconstruction technique. All irradiated hamstring tendon allografts were 
sterilized with 2.5 Mrad of irradiation before distribution and were obtained 
from a single certified tissue bank. Graft fixation on the femoral side was by 
an Endobutton, and on the tibial side by a bioabsorbable interference screw 
augmented with a staple. The same rehabilitation protocol was applied to all 
patients. Before surgery and at a mean of 6.9 years of follow-up, patients were 
evaluated by the same observer according to objective and subjective clinical 
evaluations including detailed history, physical examination, radiography, 
functional knee ligament testing, KT-2000 arthrometer testing, Harner vertical 
jump and Daniel 1-legged hop tests, Lysholm score, Tegner score, International 
Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) standard evaluation form, and Cincinnati

RESULTS: A total of 83 patients (Auto: n = 40 [mean age, 29.2 ± 6.9 years]; 
Ir-Allo: n = 43 [mean age, 28.6 ± 7.2 years]) fulfilled follow-up and clinical

testing of activity levels. Differences were found when comparing the results at 
final follow-up according to the Lachman test, anterior drawer test, pivot-shift 
test, and KT-2000 arthrometer measurements (P < .001). 87.5% of patients in the 
Auto group and 34.9% in the Ir-Allo group had a side-to-side difference <3 mm. 
The rate of laxity (side-to-side difference >5 mm) with an irradiated allograft 
(30.2%) was higher than that with an autograft (7.5%) (P < .001). The failure 
rate in the Ir-Allo group (30.2%) was higher than that in the Auto group (7.5%)

27604584,Navigation is Equal to Estimation by Eye and Palpation in Preventing Psoas Impingement in THA.,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,  Focus on (+) subgroup analysis,Claim benefit based on (+) subgroup analysis,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Iliopsoas tendon impingement is one possible reason for persistent 
groin pain and diminished functional outcome after THA. So far, estimation by 
eye and palpation is the standard procedure to intraoperatively assess the 
distance of the cup to the anterior rim. However, novel technologies such as 
imageless navigation enable intraoperative measurements of the cup in relation 
to the psoas tendon and bony landmarks.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether psoas impingement can be reduced using 
imageless navigation compared with the standard technique.
METHODS: The current study is a reanalysis of data from a randomized controlled 
trial evaluating navigation for THA; 135 patients were randomized for surgery 
with or without the use of imageless navigation. The primary outcome was the 
risk for anterior protrusion of the cup above the acetabular rim and thus 
potential psoas impingement, defined as an overhang of the cup above the 
anterior acetabular rim as measured on postoperative CT, which was either 
controlled with the help of navigation or standard control by eye and palpation 
intraoperatively. Postoperatively, the anterior protrusion of the cup above the 
acetabular rim was measured on three-dimensional (3-D) CT by a blinded, external 
institute. In addition to patient-related outcome measures, the Harris hip 
score, Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and EuroQol were 
obtained 1 year postoperatively. Altogether 123 data sets were available for 
primary analysis and 115 were available for 1-year followup.
RESULTS: There was no difference, with the numbers available, between the 
navigated and the control groups in terms of the mean distance of the cup below 
the anterosuperior acetabular rim (3.9 mm; -5.3 to 12.6 mm versus 4.4 mm; -7.9 
to 13.7 mm; p = 0.72) or the anteroinferior acetabular rim (4.7 mm; -6.2 to 14.8 
mm versus 4.2 mm; -7.1 to 16.3 mm; p = 0.29). There was no difference, with the 
numbers available, in terms of the proportion of cups with anterior overhang 
(7%, four of 57 versus, 15%, 10 of 66; p = 0.16), respectively. After 
controlling for potential confounding variables such as cup inclination, cup 
size, patient age, BMI, stage of arthritis, and length of skin incision, we 
found cup anteversion (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% CI, 0.81-0.93; p < 0.001) 
and female sex (HR, 3.88; 95% CI, 1.01-14.93; p = 0.049) were associated with a 
propensity to potential psoas impingement. With the numbers available, there 
were no differences observed in clinical scores between groups with and without 
anterior cup protrusion.

27604584,Navigation is Equal to Estimation by Eye and Palpation in Preventing Psoas Impingement in THA.,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,  Focus on (+) subgroup analysis,Claim benefit based on (+) subgroup analysis,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Iliopsoas tendon impingement is one possible reason for persistent 
groin pain and diminished functional outcome after THA. So far, estimation by 
eye and palpation is the standard procedure to intraoperatively assess the 
distance of the cup to the anterior rim. However, novel technologies such as 
imageless navigation enable intraoperative measurements of the cup in relation 
to the psoas tendon and bony landmarks.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether psoas impingement (1) can be reduced using 
imageless navigation compared with the standard technique and (2) is associated 
with specific patient characteristics. Furthermore, we investigated (3) if 
anterior cup protrusion (overhang) is associated with lower outcome scores for 
pain and function.
METHODS: The current study is a reanalysis of data from a randomized controlled 
trial evaluating navigation for THA; 135 patients were randomized for surgery 
with or without the use of imageless navigation. The risk for anterior 
protrusion of the cup above the acetabular rim and thus potential psoas 
impingement, defined as an overhang of the cup above the anterior acetabular rim 
as measured on postoperative CT, was either controlled with the help of 
navigation or standard control by eye and palpation intraoperatively. 
Postoperatively, the anterior protrusion of the cup above the acetabular rim was 
measured on three-dimensional (3-D) CT by a blinded, external institute. In 
addition to patient-related outcome measures, the Harris hip score, Hip 
disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and EuroQol were obtained 1 year 
postoperatively. Altogether 123 data sets were available for primary analysis 
and 115 were available for 1-year followup.
RESULTS: There was no difference, with the numbers available, between the 
navigated and the control groups in terms of the mean distance of the cup below 
the anterosuperior acetabular rim (3.9 mm; -5.3 to 12.6 mm versus 4.4 mm; -7.9 
to 13.7 mm; p = 0.72) or the anteroinferior acetabular rim (4.7 mm; -6.2 to 14.8 
mm versus 4.2 mm; -7.1 to 16.3 mm; p = 0.29). There was no difference, with the 
numbers available, in terms of the proportion of cups with anterior overhang 
(7%, four of 57 versus, 15%, 10 of 66; p = 0.16), respectively. After 
controlling for potential confounding variables such as cup inclination, cup 
size, patient age, BMI, stage of arthritis, and length of skin incision, we 
found cup anteversion (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% CI, 0.81-0.93; p < 0.001) 
and female sex (HR, 3.88; 95% CI, 1.01-14.93; p = 0.049) were associated with a 
propensity to potential psoas impingement. With the numbers available, there 
were no differences observed in clinical scores between groups with and without 
anterior cup protrusion.
CONCLUSIONS: We found no differences between imageless navigation and estimation 
by eye and palpation in preventing potential psoas impingement. Despite the 
comparable clinical outcome for patients with and without cup protrusion, the 
orthopaedic surgeon should be especially aware of propensity for psoas 
impingement in women.",no_spin,<|user|>,,"[{'token': 27, 'token_string': '<', 'logits': -1.0482336282730103, 'probability': 0.3505564033985138}, {'token': 91, 'token_string': '|', 'logits': -0.00973277073353529, 'probability': 0.9903144240379333}, {'token': 882, 'token_string': 'user', 'logits': -0.663282573223114, 'probability': 0.5151575207710266}, {'token': 91, 'token_string': '|', 'logits': -0.004232734441757202, 'probability': 0.9957762360572815}, {'token': 29, 'token_string': '>', 'logits': -0.07198919355869293, 'probability': 0.9305409789085388}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': -0.0521547831594944, 'probability': 0.949181854724884}]"

there is insufficient data comparing different bands in the long term. We 
carried out a prospective randomized study to compare two different bands.
METHODS: Between January 1, 2009 and January 31, 2010, 103 morbidly obese 
patients were randomized between SAGB and MiniMizer Extra adjustable gastric 
bands. The SAGB was used in 49 and MiniMizer Extra in 54 patients. Weight loss, 
comorbidities, long-term complications, and quality of life were evaluated after 
5В years.
RESULTS: Patient baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. The 
mean patient age was 45.9В В±В 11.7В years, and mean preoperative BMI was 
47.5В В±В 7.3В kg/m2. A total of 90 of 103 patients (87.3В %) completed the 5-year 
follow-up. The mean excess weight loss was 44.1 and 50.3В % in SAGB and MiniMizer 
groups, respectively (pВ =В 0.14). A proportion of patients who reached a 
BMIВ <В 35В kg/m2 was significantly larger in MiniMizer Extra group (52.9 vs 
25.5В %; pВ =В 0.01). Complications developed in 15 patients (14.5В %) and consisted 
of 5 band erosions, 4 port-related complications, 3 band slippages, and 3 band 
intolerances. All five band erosions developed in MiniMizer Extra group, but the 
difference was not significant (pВ =В 0.058). No difference was found regarding 
postoperative complications, resolution of comorbidities, and quality of life

Design: A randomised controlled trial of 503 participants followed for six months.

Setting: Participants were recruited from two tertiary acute care settings in Kingston, ON, Canada.

Participants: The broad inclusion criteria were patients aged і16 presenting for acute medical assessment and treatment of a simple grade 1 or 2 ankle sprain. Exclusions were patients with multiple injuries, other conditions limiting mobility, and ankle injuries that required immobilisation and those unable to accommodate the time intensive study protocol.

Intervention: Participants received either usual care, consisting of written instructions regarding protection, rest, cryotherapy, compression, elevation, and graduated weight bearing activities, or usual care enhanced with a supervised programme of physiotherapy.

Main outcome measures: The primary outcome of efficacy was the proportion of participants reporting excellent recovery assessed with the foot and ankle outcome score (FAOS). Excellent recovery was defined as a score і450/500 at three months. A difference of at least 15% increase in the absolute proportion of participants with excellent recovery was deemed clinically important. Secondary analyses included the assessment of excellent recovery at one and six months; change from baseline using continuous scores at one, three, and six months; and clinical and biomechanical measures of ankle function, assessed at one, three, and six months.

Results: The absolute proportion of patients achieving excellent recovery at three months was not significantly different between the physiotherapy (98/229, 43%) and usual care (79/214, 37%) arms (absolute difference 6%, 95% confidence interval -3% to 15%).

Participants: The broad inclusion criteria were patients aged і16 presenting for acute medical assessment and treatment of a simple grade 1 or 2 ankle sprain. Exclusions were patients with multiple injuries, other conditions limiting mobility, and ankle injuries that required immobilisation and those unable to accommodate the time intensive study protocol.

Intervention: Participants received either usual care, consisting of written instructions regarding protection, rest, cryotherapy, compression, elevation, and graduated weight bearing activities, or usual care enhanced with a supervised programme of physiotherapy.

Main outcome measures: The primary outcome of efficacy was the proportion of participants reporting excellent recovery assessed with the foot and ankle outcome score (FAOS). Excellent recovery was defined as a score і450/500 at three months. A difference of at least 15% increase in the absolute proportion of participants with excellent recovery was deemed clinically important. Secondary analyses included the assessment of excellent recovery at one and six months; change from baseline using continuous scores at one, three, and six months; and clinical and biomechanical measures of ankle function, assessed at one, three, and six months.

Results: The absolute proportion of patients achieving excellent recovery at three months was not significantly different between the physiotherapy (98/229, 43%) and usual care (79/214, 37%) arms (absolute difference 6%, 95% confidence interval -3% to 15%). These results remained similar when the FAOS was analysed as a continuous change score.

Conclusions: Supervised physiotherapy was not more effective than usual care in achieving excellent recovery in patients with simple grade 1 and 2 ankle sprains.",spin,<|user|>,,"[{'token': 27, 'token_string': '<', 'logits': -1.0551011562347412, 'probability': 0.34815722703933716}, {'token': 91, 'token_string': '|', 'logits': -0.01621018536388874, 'probability': 0.9839205145835876}, {'token': 882, 'token_string': 'user', 'logits': -0.4201400578022003, 'probability': 0.656954824924469}, {'token': 91, 'token_string': '|', 'logits': -0.003921676892787218, 'probability': 0.996086061000824}, {'token': 29, 'token_string': '>', 'logits': -0.08539096266031265, 'probability': 0.9181533455848694}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': -0.06421341747045517, 'probability': 0.9378048181533813}]"

PURPOSE: To compare the long-term results of patellar instability after TTT with

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: A total of 34 patients (36 knees) were randomized to 2 groups. The 
first group underwent lateral release (LR) and TTT for confirmed maltracking of 
the patella (control group). The second group underwent MPFL reconstruction in 
addition to TTT and LR (reconstruction group). The primary outcomes were 
validated questionnaires (Kujala score, Tegner activity score) and a visual

clinical assessment, redislocation rates, reoperation rates, time to return to 
activities, patient satisfaction, and quantitative computed tomography (CT) at 1

PURPOSE: To compare the clinical and anatomic outcomes of the interference screw

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: A total of 80 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair

the tenodesis method: the IS and SA groups. The primary outcome was the anatomic 
status of tenodesis estimated using magnetic resonance imaging or

joint precede radiographic abnormalities of posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) 
by as much as decades. A growing body of evidence strongly suggests that the 
progression from anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury to PTOA is 
multifactorial, involving the interplay between biomechanical disturbances and 
biochemical homeostasis of articular cartilage.
PURPOSE: The purposes of this randomized study using an acute ACL injury model 
were to (1) evaluate the natural progression of inflammatory and 
chondrodegenerative biomarkers, (2) evaluate the relationship between subjective 
reports of pain and inflammatory and chondrodegenerative biomarkers, and (3) 
determine if postinjury arthrocentesis and corticosteroid injection offer the 
ability to alter this biochemical cascade.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: A total of 49 patients were randomized to 4 groups: group 1 
(corticosteroid at 4 days after ACL injury, placebo injection of saline at 2 
weeks), group 2 (placebo at 4 days after ACL injury, corticosteroid at 2 weeks), 
group 3 (corticosteroid at both time intervals), or a placebo group (saline 
injections at both time intervals). Patient-reported outcome measures and 
synovial biomarkers were collected at approximately 4 days, 11 days, and 5 weeks 
after injury. The change between the time points was assessed for all variables 
using Wilcoxon tests, and the relationship between changes in outcome scores and 
biomarkers were assessed by calculating Spearman ПЃ. Outcomes and biomarkers were 
also compared between the 4 groups using Kruskal-Wallis tests.
RESULTS: No adverse events or infections were observed in any study patients. 
With the exception of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) and tumor necrosis 
factor-inducible gene 6 (TSG-6), chondrodegenerative markers worsened over the 
first 5 weeks while all patient-reported outcomes improved during this time, 
regardless of treatment group. Patient-reported outcomes did not differ between 
patients receiving corticosteroid injections and the placebo group. However, 
increases in C-telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II), associated with 
collagen type II breakdown, were significantly greater in the placebo group 
(1.32 В± 1.10 ng/mL) than in either of the groups that received the 
corticosteroid injection within the first several days after injury (group 1: 
0.23 В± 0.27 ng/mL [ P = .01]; group 3: 0.19 В± 0.34 ng/mL [ P = .01]).
CONCLUSION: PTOA begins at the time of injury and results early on in dramatic 
matrix changes in the knee. However, it is encouraging that early intervention 
with an anti-inflammatory agent was able to affect biomarkers of chondral 
degeneration. Should early intervention lead to meaningful changes in either the 
onset or severity of symptomatic PTOA, the current treatment paradigm for 
patients with ACL injury may have to be restructured to include early aspiration 
and intra-articular intervention.",no_spin,<|user|>,,"[{'token': 27, 'token_string': '<', 'logits': -1.0342040061950684, 'probability': 0.3555092215538025}, {'token': 91, 'token_string': '|', 'logits': -0.011142765171825886, 'probability': 0.9889190793037415}, {'token': 882, 'token_string': 'user', 'logits': -0.6150733232498169, 'probability': 0.5406013131141663}, {'token': 91, 'token_string': '|', 'logits': -0.004992162808775902, 'probability': 0.9950202107429504}, {'token': 29, 'token_string': '>', 'logits': -0.08152738958597183, 'probability': 0.9217074513435364}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': -0.05665271356701851, 'probability': 0.9449222087860107}]"

treatment focuses on management of respiratory distress and hypoxia. High-flow 
warm humidified oxygen (HFWHO) is increasingly used, but has not been rigorously 
studied in randomised trials. We aimed to examine whether HFWHO provided 
enhanced respiratory support, thereby shortening time to weaning off oxygen.
METHODS: In this open, phase 4, randomised controlled trial, we recruited 
children aged less than 24 months with moderate bronchiolitis attending the 
emergency department of the John Hunter Hospital or the medical unit of the John 
Hunter Children's Hospital in New South Wales, Australia. Patients were randomly 
allocated (1:1) via opaque sealed envelopes to HFWHO (maximum flow of 1 L/kg per 
min to a limit of 20 L/min using 1:1 air-oxygen ratio, resulting in a maximum 
FiO2 of 0В·6) or standard therapy (cold wall oxygen 100% via infant nasal 
cannulae at low flow to a maximum of 2 L/min) using a block size of four and 
stratifying for gestational age at birth. The primary outcome was time from 
randomisation to last use of oxygen therapy. All randomised children were 
included in the primary and secondary safety analyses. This trial is registered 
with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number 
ACTRN12612000685819.
FINDINGS: From July 16, 2012, to May 1, 2015, we randomly assigned 202 children 
to either HFWHO (101 children) or standard therapy (101 children). Median time 
to weaning was 24 h (95% CI 18-28) for standard therapy and 20 h (95% CI 17-34) 
for HFWHO (hazard ratio [HR] for difference in survival distributions 0В·9 [95% 
CI 0В·7-1В·2]; log rank p=0В·61). Fewer children experienced treatment failure on 
HFWHO (14 [14%]) compared with standard therapy (33 [33%]; p=0В·0016); of these 
children, those on HFWHO were supported for longer than were those on standard 
therapy before treatment failure (HR 0В·3; 95% CI 0В·2-0В·6; p<0В·0001). 20 (61%) of 
33 children who experienced treatment failure on standard therapy were rescued 
with HFWHO. 12 (12%) of children on standard therapy required transfer to the 
intensive care unit compared with 14 (14%) of those on HFWHO (difference -1%; 
95% CI -7 to 16; p=0В·41). Four adverse events occurred (oxygen desaturation and 
condensation inhalation in the HFWHO group, and two incidences of oxygen tubing 
disconnection in the standard therapy group); none resulted in withdrawal from 
the trial. No oxygen-related serious adverse events occurred. Secondary 
effectiveness outcomes are reported in the Results section.
INTERPRETATION: HFWHO did not significantly reduce time on oxygen compared with 
standard therapy, suggesting that early use of HFWHO does not modify the 
underlying disease process in moderately severe bronchiolitis. HFWHO might have 
a role as a rescue therapy to reduce the proportion of children requiring

Materials and methods: We compared isocaloric diets containing 30% of energy either as AP or PP, using newly developed PP-enriched foods, both combined with 30% energy as fat and 40% as carbohydrates in 44 patients with T2DM over 6 weeks in a randomized parallel-group study. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamps and cardiovascular variables were measured.

Results: Uric acid decreased in both groups, but significantly more in the AP than the PP group. There were no significant differences in other variables, although glycated haemoglobin levels, diastolic blood pressure and fasting non-esterified fatty acid levels improved significantly in the PP but not in the AP group. Insulin sensitivity (M-value), C-reactive protein and fasting glucose improved significantly in the AP but not in the PP group. Total and LDL cholesterol levels and systolic blood pressure decreased significantly in both groups, and the urinary albumin excretion rate decreased from baseline in participants with microalbuminuria.

techniques for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Controversy has arisen as each 
conceptually differs in how the knee is balanced through bone and soft tissue 
management. The objective of the present study was to compare both the frequency 
of condylar liftoff and the location of femorotibial contact from extension 
through midflexion between patients undergoing GB or MR TKA.
METHODS: A total of 24 knees (23 patients) were randomly assigned at referral to 
either a surgeon performing MR or GB TKA with the same single radius, 
posterior-stabilized implant (12 per cohort). At 1-year postoperation, patients 
underwent biplanar radiographic imaging at 0В°, 20В°, 40В°, and 60В° of flexion. 
Condylar liftoff, contact location, and magnitude of excursion on each condyle 
were measured. Preoperative and postoperative clinical outcome scores were also 
collected.
RESULTS: There was no difference (PВ = .41) in the frequency of liftoff between 
cohorts. The MR cohort had more posterior contact on the medial condyle (P < 
.01) and more anterior contact on the lateral condyle (P < .01) throughout 
flexion. Motion patterns were similar between cohorts, with similar medial (PВ = 
.48) and lateral (PВ = .44) excursion, which was equal in magnitude between 
condyles for both MR (PВ = .48) and GB (PВ = .73). There was no difference in

1:00:44, PВ =В 0.340). Closure of the enterotomy (GJA) was 07:41В min in the 
S-group versus 08:13В min in the V-group (PВ =В 0.005). Extra stitches (GJA) 
were performed in 33 patients (16.5%): 3 (h) and 20 (c) in the V-group and 1 
(h) and 9 (c) in the S-group. Four patients in the V-group suffered from 
postoperative intraluminal bleeding (3 self-limiting, 1 underwent endoscopic 
clipping). In the S-group, 1 patient suffered from leakage at the vertical 
transected staple line of the stomach.

unpredictable. To overcome the shortcomings of the microfracture technique,

HYPOTHESIS: The quality of cartilage repair and clinical outcomes would be 
superior in patients undergoing high tibial osteotomy (HTO) with microfracture 
and collagen augmentation compared to those undergoing HTO with microfracture 
alone without collagen augmentation for the treatment of medial compartment 
osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.
METHODS: Twenty-eight patients undergoing HTO were randomized into 2 groups: 
microfracture alone (group 1, n = 14) or microfracture with collagen 
augmentation (group 2, n = 14). At 1 year postoperatively, second-look 
arthroscopic surgery and biopsy of repaired cartilage were performed at the time 
of HTO plate removal. Biopsy specimens were graded using the International 
Cartilage Repair Society Visual Assessment Scale II (ICRS II). In addition, 
imaging outcomes in terms of the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage 
repair tissue (MOCART) score were assessed based on magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI). Finally, clinical outcomes in terms of the visual analog scale (VAS) for 
pain score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International 
Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and Tegner activity scale score were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: The mean ICRS II score in group 2 was significantly higher than that in 
group 1 (1053.2 vs 885.4, respectively; P = .002). Group 2 showed greater 
improvement in tissue morphology, cell morphology, surface architecture, 
middle/deep zone assessment, and overall assessment compared with group 1 ( P < 
.050 for all comparisons). Imaging outcomes based on the MOCART score were 
superior in group 2 compared to those in group 1 on MRI at 1 year 
postoperatively (64.6 vs 45.4, respectively; P = .001). The degree of defect 
repair was better in group 2 than in group 1 ( P = .040). Clinical outcomes in 
terms of the VAS for pain score, KOOS, IKDC score, and Tegner activity scale 
score were improved in both groups without between-group differences ( P > .100 
for all comparisons).
CONCLUSION: The quality of cartilage repair after microfracture with collagen 
augmentation was superior to that after microfracture alone in patients 
undergoing HTO. Clinical results after 1 year did not reflect this difference in 
tissue repair. Therefore, a longer follow-up of the cohort is needed to answer

Biological analysis of PRP has demonstrated an anti-inflammatory effect on the intra-articular environment.

Purpose: To compare the clinical and biological effects of an intra-articular injection of PRP with those of an intra-articular injection of HA in patients with mild to moderate knee OA.

Study design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods: A total of 111 patients with symptomatic unilateral knee OA received a series of either leukocyte-poor PRP or HA injections under ultrasound guidance. Clinical data were collected before treatment and at 4 time points across a 1-year period. Synovial fluid was also collected for analysis of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers before treatment and at 12 and 24 weeks after treatment. Several measures were used to assess results: (1) Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale; (2) International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee evaluation, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, and Lysholm knee score; and (3) difference in intra-articular biochemical marker concentrations.

Results: There were 49 patients randomized to treatment with PRP and 50 randomized to treatment with HA. No difference was seen between the groups in the primary outcome measure (WOMAC pain score). In the secondary outcome measure, linear contrasts identified a significantly higher IKDC score in the PRP group compared with the HA group at 24 weeks (mean ± standard error [SE], 65.5 ± 3.6 vs 55.8 ± 3.8, respectively; P = .013) and at final follow-up (52 weeks) (57.6 ± 3.37 vs 46.6 ± 3.76, respectively; P = .003). Linear contrasts also identified a statistically lower VAS score in the PRP group versus the HA group at 24 weeks (mean ± SE, 34.6 ± 3.24 vs 48.6 ± 3.7, respectively; P = .0096) and 52 weeks (44 ± 4.6 vs 57.3 ± 3.8, respectively; P = .0039). An examination of fixed effects showed that patients with mild OA and a lower body mass index had a statistically significant improvement in outcomes.

Conclusion: We found no difference between HA and PRP at any time point in the primary outcome measure: the patient-reported WOMAC pain score.

significantly. Liposomal bupivacaine (LB) is an extended-release delivery of a 
phospholipid bilayer encapsulating bupivacaine that can result in drug delivery 
up to 72 hours. Prior studies in lower extremity surgery demonstrated efficacy 
of LB in comparison to a single-shot peripheral nerve block; however, no study 
has investigated LB in a total shoulder arthroplasty population. Therefore, this 
study compared LB vs. an indwelling interscalene nerve block (IINB).
METHODS: This is a prospective, randomized study of 83 consecutive shoulder 
arthroplasty patients; 36 patients received LB and a ""bridge"" of 30 mL of 0.5% 
bupivacaine, and 47 patients received an IINB. The primary outcome was 
postoperative visual analog scale pain levels. Secondary outcomes included 
opiate consumption measured with oral morphine equivalents, length of hospital 
stay, and postoperative complications. Continuous variables were compared using 
an analysis of variance with significance set at P < .05.
RESULTS: Visual analog scale pain scores were statistically higher in the LB 
cohort immediately postoperatively in the postanesthesia care unit (7.25 vs. 
1.91; P = .000) as well as for the remainder of postoperative day 0 (4.99 vs. 
3.20; P = .005) but not for the remainder of admission. Opiate consumption was 
significantly higher among the LB cohort in the postanesthesia care unit (31.79 
vs. 7.47; P = .000), on postoperative day 0 (32.64 vs. 15.04; P = .000), and for 
the total hospital admission (189.50 vs. 91.70, P = .000). Complication numbers 
and length of stay were not statistically different.

28479257,Liposomal bupivacaine versus indwelling interscalene nerve block for postoperative pain control in shoulder arthroplasty: a prospective randomized controlled trial.,Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery,,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Pain management strategies following shoulder arthroplasty vary 
significantly. Liposomal bupivacaine (LB) is an extended-release delivery of a 
phospholipid bilayer encapsulating bupivacaine that can result in drug delivery 
up to 72 hours. Prior studies in lower extremity surgery demonstrated efficacy 
of LB in comparison to a single-shot peripheral nerve block; however, no study 
has investigated LB in a total shoulder arthroplasty population. Therefore, this 
study compared LB vs. an indwelling interscalene nerve block (IINB).
METHODS: This is a prospective, randomized study of 83 consecutive shoulder 
arthroplasty patients; 36 patients received LB and a ""bridge"" of 30вЂ‰mL of 0.5% 
bupivacaine, and 47 patients received an IINB. Postoperative visual analog scale 
pain levels, opiate consumption measured with oral morphine equivalents, length 
of hospital stay, and postoperative complications were recorded. Continuous 
variables were compared using an analysis of variance with significance set at 
PвЂ‰<вЂ‰.05.
RESULTS: Visual analog scale pain scores were statistically higher in the LB 
cohort immediately postoperatively in the postanesthesia care unit (7.25 vs. 
1.91; PвЂ‰=вЂ‰.000) as well as for the remainder of postoperative day 0 (4.99 vs. 
3.20; PвЂ‰=вЂ‰.005) but not for the remainder of admission. Opiate consumption was 
significantly higher among the LB cohort in the postanesthesia care unit (31.79 
vs. 7.47; PвЂ‰=вЂ‰.000), on postoperative day 0 (32.64 vs. 15.04; PвЂ‰=вЂ‰.000), and for 
the total hospital admission (189.50 vs. 91.70, PвЂ‰=вЂ‰.000). Complication numbers 
and length of stay were not statistically different.

Methods: Sixty morbid obese patients (BMI і 35) were evaluated before and after 12 weeks of bariatric surgery in order to compare the impact of two different exercise programs on body composition and functional capacity outcomes. Participants were divided into three groups: aerobic (A), aerobic-strength (AS), and control (C) group. Aerobic capacity was assessed with 12-min walk-run test (12MWRT). One-repetition maximum (1RM) test was performed to evaluation upper limb muscle strength. Lower extremity functional capacity was assessed by sit-to-stand test.

Results: Weight, percent body fat (PBF), and fat mass (FM) reduced greater in the trial groups in comparison to the C group (P < 0.05).

failure criteria at follow-up visits: fever; increase in erythema (>25%), 
swelling, or tenderness (days 3-4); no decrease in erythema, swelling, or 
tenderness (days 8-10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness 
(days 14-21). A clinically significant difference was defined as greater than

28648708,Randomized Prospective Trial Comparing the Use of Intravenous versus Oral Acetaminophen in Total Joint Arthroplasty.,The Journal of Arthroplasty,  Other,,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Background: Multimodal pain management has had a significant effect on improving total joint arthroplasty recovery and patient satisfaction. There is literature supporting that intravenous (IV) acetaminophen reduces postoperative pain and narcotic use in the total joint population. However, there are no studies comparing the effectiveness of IV vs oral (PO) acetaminophen as part of a standard multimodal perioperative pain regimen.

Methods: One hundred twenty patients undergoing hip and knee arthroplasty surgeries performed by one joint arthroplasty surgeon were prospectively randomized into 2 groups. Group 1 (63 patients) received IV and group 2 (57 patients) received PO acetaminophen in addition to a standard multimodal perioperative pain regimen. Each group received 1 gram of acetaminophen preoperatively and then every 6 hours for 24 hours. Total narcotic use and visual analog scale (VAS) scores were collected every 4 hours postoperatively.

Results: The 24-hour average hydromorphone equivalents given were not different between groups (3.71 vs 3.48) at 24 hours (P = .76), or at any of the individual 4-hour intervals. The 24-hour average visual analog scale scores in group 1 (IV) was 3.00 and in group 2 (PO) was 3.40 (P = .06). None of the 4-hour intervals were significantly different except the first interval (0-4 hour postoperatively), which favored the IV group (P = .03).

care-centered program (Next Steps) in low-income children.
METHODS: Five hundred forty-nine Hispanic and black children (BMIвЂ‰в‰ҐвЂ‰85th

RESULTS: For age group 6-8, MEND/CATCH6-12 resulted in greater improvement in

temperature management (TTM) at 33В°C to 36В°C in unconscious patients with 
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest for at least 24 hours, but the optimal duration 
of TTM is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether TTM at 33В°C for 48 hours results in better 
neurologic outcomes compared with currently recommended, standard, 24-hour TTM.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was an international, 
investigator-initiated, blinded-outcome-assessor, parallel, pragmatic, 
multicenter, randomized clinical superiority trial in 10 intensive care units 
(ICUs) at 10 university hospitals in 6 European countries. Three hundred 
fifty-five adult, unconscious patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were 
enrolled from February 16, 2013, to June 1, 2016, with final follow-up on 
December 27, 2016.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to TTM (33вЂ‰В±вЂ‰1В°C) for 48 hours (nвЂ‰=вЂ‰176) 
or 24 hours (nвЂ‰=вЂ‰179), followed by gradual rewarming of 0.5В°C per hour until

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was 6-month neurologic outcome, 
with a Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) score of 1 or 2 used to define 
favorable outcome. Secondary outcomes included 6-month mortality, including time 
to death, the occurrence of adverse events, and intensive care unit resource 
use.
RESULTS: In 355 patients who were randomized (mean age, 60 years; 295 [83%] 
men), 351 (99%) completed the trial. Of these patients, 69% (120/175) in the

the 24-hour group (difference, 4.9%; 95% CI, -5% to 14.8%; relative risk [RR], 
1.08; 95% CI, 0.93-1.25; PвЂ‰=вЂ‰.33). Six-month mortality was 27% (48/175) in the 
48-hour group and 34% (60/177) in the 24-hour group (difference, -6.5%; 95% CI, 
-16.1% to 3.1%; RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.59-1.11; PвЂ‰=вЂ‰.19). There was no significant 
difference in the time to mortality between the 48-hour group and the 24-hour 
group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.54-1.15; PвЂ‰=вЂ‰.22). Adverse events were more 
common in the 48-hour group (97%) than in the 24-hour group (91%) (difference,

significantly higher Constant strength subscale score was observed in the PRP 
group (3.3 points; 95% CI, 1.0-5.7; P = .006). There was no evidence for any 
group differences in MRI scores or retear rates, with 66.7% of PRP patients and 
64.3% of control patients rated as Sugaya grade 1. Two control patients had 
symptomatic retears (both full thickness) within the first 16 weeks after 
surgery compared with 2 PRP patients, who suffered symptomatic retears (both 
partial thickness) between 16 weeks and a mean 3.5-year follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Significant postoperative clinical improvements and high levels of 
patient satisfaction were observed in patients at the midterm review after 
supraspinatus repair. While pain-free, maximal abduction strength was greater in 
the midterm after PRP treatment, repeated applications of PRP delivered at 7 and 
14 days after surgery provided no additional benefit to tendon integrity.",no_spin,<|user|>,,"[{'token': 27, 'token_string': '<', 'logits': -1.1417243480682373, 'probability': 0.31926801800727844}, {'token': 91, 'token_string': '|', 'logits': -0.01333861704915762, 'probability': 0.9867499470710754}, {'token': 882, 'token_string': 'user', 'logits': -0.551830530166626, 'probability': 0.5758946537971497}, {'token': 91, 'token_string': '|', 'logits': -0.0049957213923335075, 'probability': 0.9950167536735535}, {'token': 29, 'token_string': '>', 'logits': -0.07135803252458572, 'probability': 0.9311284422874451}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': -0.06855470687150955, 'probability': 0.9337424039840698}]"

33332160,Platelet-rich plasma for arthroscopic repair of medium to large rotator cuff tears: a randomized controlled trial.,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,,Claim benefit based on (+) secondary endpoint,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether leukocyte-poor (LP) or leukocyte-rich (LR) 
varieties of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) as an adjuvant to arthroscopic rotator 
cuff repair (ARCR) result in improved tendon healing rates.
PURPOSE: To perform a network meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials 
in the literature to ascertain whether there is evidence to support the use of 
LP- or LR-PRP as an adjunct to ARCR.
METHODS: The literature search was based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Randomized 
controlled trials comparing LP- or LR-PRP with a control alongside ARCR were 
included. Clinical outcomes, including retears and functional outcomes, were 
compared using a frequentist approach to network meta-analysis, with statistical 
analysis performed using R. The treatment options were ranked using the P-score.
RESULTS: There were 13 studies (868 patients) included, with 9 studies comparing 
LP-PRP with a control and 4 studies comparing LR-PRP with a control. LP-PRP was 
found to significantly reduce the rate of retear and/or incomplete tendon 
healing after fixation, even among medium-large tears; it also improved outcomes 
on the visual analog scale for pain, Constant score, and University of 
California Los Angeles score. LP-PRP had the highest P-score for all treatment 
groups. LR-PRP did not result in any significant improvements over the control 
group, except for visual analog scale score for pain. However, post hoc analysis 
revealed that LP-PRP did not lead to significant improvements over LR-PRP in any 
category.
CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrates that LP-PRP reduces the rate of 
retear and/or incomplete tendon healing after ARCR and improves patient-reported 
outcomes as compared with a control. However, it is still unclear whether LP-PRP 
improves the tendon healing rate when compared with LR-PRP.",no_spin,"    The answer is yes, the abstract contains spin.",yes,"[{'token': 262, 'token_string': '   ', 'logits': -1.0532394647598267, 'probability': 0.3488059639930725}, {'token': 578, 'token_string': ' The', 'logits': -0.5731110572814941, 'probability': 0.5637688040733337}, {'token': 4320, 'token_string': ' answer', 'logits': -0.5998679399490356, 'probability': 0.5488840937614441}, {'token': 374, 'token_string': ' is', 'logits': -0.0027769359294325113, 'probability': 0.9972268342971802}, {'token': 10035, 'token_string': ' yes', 'logits': -0.04618888348340988, 'probability': 0.954861581325531}, {'token': 11, 'token_string': ',', 'logits': -0.2536478340625763, 'probability': 0.7759650349617004}, {'token': 279, 'token_string': ' the', 'logits': -0.6030861139297485, 'probability': 0.5471205711364746}, {'token': 8278, 'token_string': ' abstract', 'logits': -0.3874977231025696, 'probability': 0.6787531971931458}, {'token': 5727, 'token_string': ' contains', 'logits': -0.0022509971167892218, 'probability': 0.9977515339851379}, {'token': 12903, 'token_string': ' spin', 'logits': -0.0007743220776319504, 'probability': 0.9992260336875916}, {'token': 13, 'token_string': '.', 'logits': -0.04556570574641228, 'probability': 0.9554568529129028}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': -0.4321598410606384, 'probability': 0.6491056084632874}]"
