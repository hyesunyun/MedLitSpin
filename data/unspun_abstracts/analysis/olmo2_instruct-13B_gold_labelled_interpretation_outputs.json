        "abstract": "Purpose\nTo determine if anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is superior to anatomic single-bundle reconstruction in restoring the stabilities and functions of the knee joint.\nMethods\nA prospective randomized clinical study was done to compare the results of 32 cases of anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction and 34 cases of anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction with average follow-up of 16.3 \u0412\u00b1 3.1\u0412\u00a0months. Tunnel placements of all the cases were measured on 3D CT. Clinical results were collected after reconstruction; graft's appearance, meniscus status and cartilage state under arthroscopy were compared and analysed too.\nResults\nTunnel placements, confirmed with 3D CT, were in the anatomic positions as described in literature both in SB and DB group. No differences were found between SB and DB groups in clinical outcome scores, pivot shift test and KT 1000\u0412\u00a0measurements (average side-to-side difference for anterior tibial translation was 0.7\u0412\u00a0mm in SB group and 1.0\u0412\u00a0mm in DB group). More than 70 % of the single-bundle graft and AM bundle graft in DB group appeared excellent, but only 44.1 % of PL bundle grafts in DB group were excellent and 11.8 % were in poor state. No new menisci tear was found either in SB or DB group, however, in DB group cartilage damages in medial patella-femoral joint occurred in 38.2 % cases. This rate was significantly higher than in the SB group which is only 9.3 %.\nConclusion\nBoth single- and double-bundle anatomic ACL reconstruction can restore the knee's stability and functions very well. However, more incidences of poor PL status and medial patellar-femoral cartilage damage may occur in double-bundle ACL reconstruction.",

Subjects were randomized to receive a 20 mL/kg infusion of either 5% \ndextrose in normal saline solution or normal saline solution. Serum ketone \nlevels were measured before and at 1- and 2-hour intervals after the initial \nstudy fluid bolus administration. Primary outcome was the proportion of children \nhospitalized.

The proportion of \nchildren hospitalized did not differ between groups (35% in the 5% dextrose in \nnormal saline solution group versus 44% in the normal saline solution group; \nrisk difference 9%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -5% to 22%). Compared with \nchildren who received normal saline solution, those who received 5% dextrose in \nnormal saline solution had a greater reduction in mean serum ketone levels at \nboth 1 hour (mean \u041e\u201d 1.2 versus 0.1 mmol/L; mean difference 1.1 mmol/L; 95% CI \n0.4 to 1.9 mmol/L) and 2 hours (mean \u041e\u201d 1.9 versus 0.3 mmol/L; mean difference \n1.6 mmol/L; 95% CI 0.9 to 2.3 mmol/L).\nCONCLUSION: Administration of a dextrose-containing bolus compared with normal \nsaline did not lead to a lower rate of hospitalization for children with \ngastroenteritis and dehydration.

Secondary outcome was change in serum ketone levels over time.\nRESULTS: One hundred eighty-eight children were enrolled. The proportion of \nchildren hospitalized did not differ between groups (35% in the 5% dextrose in \nnormal saline solution group versus 44% in the normal saline solution group; \nrisk difference 9%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -5% to 22%). Children who received 5% dextrose in \nnormal saline solution had a reduction in mean serum ketone levels at \nboth 1 hour (mean \u0394 1.2 versus 0.1 mmol/L; mean difference 1.1 mmol/L; 95% CI \n0.4 to 1.9 mmol/L) and 2 hours (mean \u0394 1.9 versus 0.3 mmol/L; mean difference \n1.6 mmol/L; 95% CI 0.9 to 2.3 mmol/L).\nCONCLUSION: 5% dextrose in normal saline solution was not more effective than normal saline solution on hospitalization rates in children with gastroenteritis and dehydration.",

Patient pain levels were measured using the visual analog scale (VAS) at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h post-operatively. Additionally, the number of boluses and total amount of fentanyl dispensed by patient-controlled analgesia administration during the 24-h post-operative period were evaluated.\n\nResults: VAS scores did not differ significantly between groups I and II during the 24-h post-operative period. Mean fentanyl bolus consumption was significantly less in group I compared with group II (p = 0.015).\n\nConclusion: Arthroscopy-guided suprascapular nerve block was not more effective than placebo in reducing post-operative pain in patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of arthroscopy-guided direct suprascapular nerve block performed after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.\n\nMethods: In the present prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical study, 30 patients were divided into two groups: 15 patients (group I) were treated with arthroscopy-guided suprascapular nerve block using 10 mL 0.5 % ropivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine, and 15 patients (group II) were treated with placebo using 10 mL 0.9 % saline after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Patient pain levels were measured using the visual analog scale (VAS) at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h post-operatively. Additionally, the number of boluses and total amount of fentanyl dispensed by patient-controlled analgesia administration during the 24-h post-operative period were evaluated.\n\nResults: VAS scores did not differ significantly between groups I and II during the 24-h post-operative period, but mean fentanyl bolus consumption was significantly less in group I compared with group II (p = 0.015).\n\nConclusion: Arthroscopy-guided suprascapular nerve block at the end of a rotator cuff repair was safe and less time-consuming than expected. Although this procedure did not significantly reduce the post-operative pain, the post-operative need for fentanyl boluses as analgesia was reduced significantly, and it would be beneficial if this procedure involved a sensory branch of axillary nerve block or was performed at the beginning of the arthroscopic procedure.",

The primary outcome was overall coronal mechanical alignment. Secondary outcomes included femoral coronal alignment, femoral axial alignment, tibial coronal alignment, and tibial sagittal alignment. In the PSG cohort, surgical navigation was used as an intraoperative control. When the suggested cut deviated more than 3\u00b0 from target, the use of PSG was abandoned and marked as an outlier.

Deviation of more than 3\u00b0 from the target in any plane was defined as an outlier.\n\nResults: The PSG and conventional cohorts showed similar numbers of outliers in overall coronal alignment (25% versus 28%; p = 0.69). There were more outliers in tibial coronal (15% versus 3%; p = 0.03) and sagittal (21% versus 3%; p = 0.002) alignment in the PSG group than in the conventional group. The PSG group showed similar outlier rates for femoral coronal alignment (7% versus 14%; p = 0.24) and femoral axial alignment (23% versus 17%; p = 0.50). PSGs were abandoned in 14 patients (22%) and modified in 18 (28%).\n\nConclusions: PSGs were not more effective than conventional instrumentation for overall coronal mechanical alignment in patients undergoing TKA.",

Inclusion criteria were patients undergoing chest, \nabdominal, or pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan with intravenous contrast, \nolder than 18 years, and at least one contrast-induced nephropathy risk factor. \nExclusion criteria were end-stage renal disease, pregnancy, N-acetylcysteine \nallergy, or clinical instability. Intervention for the treatment group was \nN-acetylcysteine 3 g in 500 mL normal saline solution as an intravenous bolus \nand then 200 mg/hour (67 mL/hour) for up to 24 hours; and for the placebo group \nwas 500 mL normal saline solution and then 67 mL/hour for up to 24 hours. The \nprimary outcome was contrast-induced nephropathy, defined as an increase in \ncreatinine level of 25% or 0.5 mg/dL, measured 48 to 72 hours after CT.\nRESULTS: The data safety and monitoring board terminated the study early for \nfutility. Of 399 patients enrolled, 357 (89%) completed follow-up and were \nincluded. The N-acetylcysteine plus saline solution group contrast-induced \nnephropathy rate was 14 of 185 (7.6%) versus 12 of 172 (7.0%) in the normal \nsaline solution only group (absolute risk difference 0.6%; 95% confidence \ninterval -4.8% to 6.0%).\nCONCLUSION: N-acetylcysteine plus normal saline solution was not more effective than normal saline solution alone in the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy in patients undergoing contrast-enhanced CT.",

Inclusion criteria were patients undergoing chest, \nabdominal, or pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan with intravenous contrast, \nolder than 18 years, and at least one contrast-induced nephropathy risk factor. \nExclusion criteria were end-stage renal disease, pregnancy, N-acetylcysteine \nallergy, or clinical instability. Intervention for the treatment group was \nN-acetylcysteine 3 g in 500 mL normal saline solution as an intravenous bolus \nand then 200 mg/hour (67 mL/hour) for up to 24 hours; and for the placebo group \nwas 500 mL normal saline solution and then 67 mL/hour for up to 24 hours. The \nprimary outcome was contrast-induced nephropathy, defined as an increase in \ncreatinine level of 25% or 0.5 mg/dL, measured 48 to 72 hours after CT.\nRESULTS: The data safety and monitoring board terminated the study early for \nfutility. Of 399 patients enrolled, 357 (89%) completed follow-up and were \nincluded. The N-acetylcysteine plus saline solution group contrast-induced \nnephropathy rate was 14 of 185 (7.6%) versus 12 of 172 (7.0%) in the normal \nsaline solution only group (absolute risk difference 0.6%; 95% confidence \ninterval -4.8% to 6.0%). The contrast-induced nephropathy rate in patients \nreceiving less than 1 L intravenous fluids in the emergency department (ED) was \n19 of 147 (12.9%) versus 7 of 210 (3.3%) for greater than 1 L intravenous fluids \n(difference 9.6%; 95% confidence interval 3.7% to 15.5%), a 69% risk reduction \n(odds ratio 0.41; 95% confidence interval 0.21 to 0.80) per liter of intravenous \nfluids.\nCONCLUSION: We did not find evidence of a benefit for N-acetylcysteine \nadministration to our ED patients undergoing contrast-enhanced CT. However, we \ndid find a significant association between volume of intravenous fluids \nadministered and reduction in contrast-induced nephropathy.",

A total of 151 patients were randomly assigned to the tenotomy group (77 patients) or the tenodesis group (74 patients). Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was performed in all the patients.

No significant differences in the clinical results for the constant scores, the forearm supination and elbow flexion strength indices, Popeye sign, cramping pain and satisfaction level were found between the groups. However, tenotomy required a shorter surgical time (40.4 \u00b1 4.0 vs. 50.4 \u00b1 5.9 min, P < 0.001) and resulted in faster pain relief (3.1 \u00b1 1.8 vs. 4.8 \u00b1 1.9, P < 0.001).\n\nConclusion: Both tenotomy and tenodesis are effective and equal for the treatment of long head biceps lesions. However, because tenotomy requires a shorter surgical time and results in faster pain relief, tenotomy may be more suitable for the treatment of long head biceps lesions in patients older than 55 years of age with reparable rotator cuff tears.",

Serum-procalcitonin (PCT) can be used to \nguide treatment when bacterial infection is suspected. Its role in pediatric \nLRTI is unclear.\nMETHODS: Between 01/2009 and 02/2010 we randomized previously healthy patients 1 \nmonth to 18 years old presenting with LRTI to the emergency departments of two \npediatric hospitals in Switzerland to receive antibiotics either according to a \nPCT guidance algorithm established for adult LRTI or standard care clinical \nguidelines. In intention-to-treat analyses, antibiotic prescribing rate, \nduration of antibiotic treatment, and number of days with impairment of daily \nactivities within 14 days of randomization were compared between the two groups.\nRESULTS: In total 337 children, mean age 3.8 years (range 0.1-18), were \nincluded. Antibiotic prescribing rates were not significantly different in PCT \nguided patients compared to controls (OR 1.26; 95% CI 0.81, 1.95). Duration \nof antibiotic exposure was reduced from 6.3 to 4.5 days under PCT guidance (-1.8 \ndays; 95% CI -3.1, -0.5; P = 0.039) for all LRTI and from 9.1 to 5.7 days for \npneumonia (-3.4 days 95% CI -4.9, -1.7; P<0.001). There was no apparent \ndifference in impairment of daily activities between PCT guided and control \npatients.\nCONCLUSION: PCT guidance was not more effective than standard care clinical \nguidelines in reducing antibiotic prescribing rate in children and adolescents \nwith lower respiratory tract infection.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Antibiotics are overused in children and adolescents with lower \nrespiratory tract infection (LRTI). Serum-procalcitonin (PCT) can be used to \nguide treatment when bacterial infection is suspected. Its role in pediatric \nLRTI is unclear.\nMETHODS: Between 01/2009 and 02/2010 we randomized previously healthy patients 1 \nmonth to 18 years old presenting with LRTI to the emergency departments of two \npediatric hospitals in Switzerland to receive antibiotics either according to a \nPCT guidance algorithm established for adult LRTI or standard care clinical \nguidelines. In intention-to-treat analyses, antibiotic prescribing rate, \nduration of antibiotic treatment, and number of days with impairment of daily \nactivities within 14 days of randomization were compared between the two groups.\nRESULTS: In total 337 children, mean age 3.8 years (range 0.1-18), were \nincluded. Antibiotic prescribing rates were not significantly different in PCT \nguided patients compared to controls (OR 1.26; 95% CI 0.81, 1.95). Mean duration \nof antibiotic exposure was reduced from 6.3 to 4.5 days under PCT guidance (-1.8 \ndays; 95% CI -3.1, -0.5; P = 0.039) for all LRTI and from 9.1 to 5.7 days for \npneumonia (-3.4 days 95% CI -4.9, -1.7; P<0.001). There was no apparent \ndifference in impairment of daily activities between PCT guided and control \npatients.\nCONCLUSION: PCT guidance reduced antibiotic exposure by reducing the duration of \nantibiotic treatment, while not affecting the antibiotic prescribing rate. The \nlatter may be explained by the low baseline prescribing rate in Switzerland for \npediatric LRTI and the choice of an inappropriately low PCT cut-off level for \nthis population.",

However, there are unanswered questions about the performance of hemiarthroplasty over the longer term compared with internal fixation.\n\nQuestions/purposes: We sought to compare hemiarthroplasty with internal fixation in terms of (1) outcomes scores for pain, hip function, and quality of life at a minimum of 5 years after surgery in a randomized trial. A secondary purpose was to compare (2) patient survival and (3) frequency of reoperation in the two groups.\n\nMethods: A total of 222 consecutive patients older than 60 years, including those cognitively impaired, with FNF were randomized to either internal fixation with two parallel screws or bipolar hemiarthroplasty. At a minimum followup of 4.9 years (mean, 5.9 years; range, 4.9-7.2 years), 68 of the 70 surviving patients were examined by a study nurse and study physiotherapist blinded to initial treatment. Questionnaires on hip function (Harris hip score), quality of life (Eq5D), and activity of daily living function (Barthel ADL) were administered. The Barthel ADL index score was split into good function (score 95 or 100) and reduced function (score below 95).\n\nResults: The mean survival of the groups was similar with 66.4% (73 of 110) of the patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty and 70.5% (79 of 112) of the patients undergoing internal fixation having died since surgery (p = 0.51). Only 12 of 31 living patients in the internal fixation group had retained their native hips at a mean of 6 years. Between 2 and 6 years, there were two new major reoperations (both in the internal fixation group, for avascular necrosis and deep wound infection). The mean Harris hip score was 66 (SD 19) and 67 (SD 20) in the internal fixation and hemiarthroplasty groups, respectively (p = 0.96). The mean Eq5D index was 0.50 (SD 0.40) in the internal fixation group and 0.34 (SD 0.36) in the hemiarthroplasty group (p = 0.10). Function in terms of ADLs was comparable between the groups; of the patients in the internal fixation group, 42% reported good function on the Barthel ADL index, and the corresponding number in the hemiarthroplasty group was 51% (p = 0.44).\n\nConclusions: Hemiarthroplasty has predictable and good long-term results after FNF and is the treatment of choice compared with internal fixation. Further studies will evaluate if total hip arthroplasty has advantages over hemiarthroplasty in patients with fracture with long life expectancy.",

        "abstract": "Background: The infrapatellar fat pad is one of the structures that obscures exposure in minimally invasive total knee arthroplasty (MIS TKA). Most MIS TKA surgeons (and many surgeons who use other approaches as well) excise the fat pad for better exposure of the knee. There is still controversy about the result of fat pad excision on patella baja, pain, and function.\n\nQuestions/purposes: In the setting of a randomized controlled trial, we sought to determine whether infrapatellar fat pad excision during MIS TKA causes (1) patellar tendon shortening (as measured by patella baja); (2) increased anterior knee pain; (3) decreases in the Knee Society Score or functional subscore; or (4) more patella-related complications.\n\nMethods: We randomized 90 patients undergoing MIS TKA at one institution into two groups. In one group, 45 patients underwent MIS TKA with complete infrapatellar fat pad excision and in the other group, 45 patients received MIS TKA without infrapatellar fat pad excision. The patella was selectively resurfaced in these patients; there was no difference between the groups in terms of the percentage of patients whose patellae were resurfaced. We measured patellar tendon shortening, knee flexion, anterior knee pain, Knee Society Score (KSS), functional subscore, and patellar complications at preoperative and postoperative periods of 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year; complete followup data were available on 86% of patients (77 of 90) who were enrolled.\n\nResults: At the final followup, no significant differences were observed in patellar tendon shortening, KSS, functional subscore, or knee flexion in either group. However, patients with their infrapatellar fat pad excised experienced more anterior knee pain (8.3% versus 0%; p = 0.03; 95% confidence interval, -0.007 to 0.174) at the end of the study. No patellar complications were found in either group.\n\nConclusions: Infrapatellar fat pad excision in MIS TKA resulted in an increasing small percentage of patients with anterior knee pain after surgery. Surgeons should keep the fat pad if excellent exposure can be achieved but resect it if needed to improve exposure during TKA.",

All patients were blinded to their \ntreatment with placebo saline catheters. Blinded coinvestigators collected data \nconcerning side effect profiles (nausea, hypotension), analgesic efficacy (VAS \npain scores, narcotic usage), and functional recovery (timed up and go test, \nquadriceps strength, WOMAC scores, Knee Society scores, early postoperative \nambulatory ability, in-hospital falls). All complications and adverse events \nwere recorded.\nRESULTS: The frequency of nausea and hypertension was not different between the \nstudy groups. During the first 12 and 24 postoperative hours, the mean maximum \nVAS pain scores were higher in the ropivacaine group than in the epidural group \n(first 12 hours: 3.93 versus 1.14, respectively, p < 0.0001; 12-24 hours: 3.52 \nversus 1.93, respectively, p = 0.008). After 24 hours, pain scores were similar \nbetween groups. Narcotic consumption was higher in the ropivacaine \ngroup on the day of surgery, but overall in-hospital narcotic usage was similar \nbetween groups. There were no differences in functional \nrecovery between groups at any time point. Patients in the epidural group \nwere more likely to have knee buckling (32.7% versus 6.7%, p = 0.002) and \ndelayed ambulation (16.3% versus 0.0%, p = 0.006) than patients in the \nropivacaine group. No infections occurred in \neither group, and the frequency of complications was not different between \ngroups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine was not more effective on analgesic efficacy than epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB in patients undergoing TKA.\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level I, therapeutic study.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pain management after TKA remains challenging and the efficacy of \ncontinuously infused intraarticular anesthetics remains a controversial topic.\nQUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We compared the side effect profile, analgesic efficacy, and \nfunctional recovery between patients receiving a continuous intraarticular \ninfusion of ropivacaine and patients receiving an epidural plus femoral nerve \nblock (FNB) after TKA.\nMETHODS: Ninety-four patients undergoing unilateral TKA were prospectively \nrandomized to receive a spinal-epidural analgesic infusion plus a \nsingle-injection FNB or a spinal anesthetic plus a continuous postoperative \nintraarticular infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine. All patients were blinded to their \ntreatment with placebo saline catheters. Blinded coinvestigators collected data \nconcerning side effect profiles (nausea, hypotension), analgesic efficacy (VAS \npain scores, narcotic usage), and functional recovery (timed up and go test, \nquadriceps strength, WOMAC scores, Knee Society scores, early postoperative \nambulatory ability, in-hospital falls). All complications and adverse events \nwere recorded.\nRESULTS: The frequency of nausea and hypertension was not different between the \nstudy groups. During the first 12 and 24 postoperative hours, the mean maximum \nVAS pain scores were higher in the ropivacaine group than in the epidural group \n(first 12 hours: 3.93 versus 1.14, respectively, p\u0412\u00a0<\u0412\u00a00.0001; 12-24 hours: 3.52 \nversus 1.93, respectively, p\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a00.008). After 24 hours, pain scores were similar \nbetween groups. Narcotic consumption was significantly higher in the ropivacaine \ngroup on the day of surgery, but overall in-hospital narcotic usage was similar \nbetween groups. There were no clinically important differences in functional \nrecovery between groups at any time point, but patients in the epidural group \nwere more likely to have knee buckling (32.7% versus 6.7%, p\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a00.002) and \ndelayed ambulation (16.3% versus 0.0%, p\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a00.006) than patients in the \nropivacaine group, though not in-hospital falls. No infections occurred in \neither group, and the frequency of complications was not different between \ngroups.\nCONCLUSIONS: A continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine can be \nrecommended as a safe, effective alternative to epidural analgesia plus \nsingle-injection FNB after TKA. Improved analgesic efficacy in the group that \nreceived epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB must be weighed against \nthe disadvantage of a higher likelihood of knee buckling and delayed ambulation \nwith that treatment approach.\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level I, therapeutic study.

Our objective was to evaluate the \neffectiveness of story booklets compared to standard information sheets for \nparents of children attending the emergency department (ED) with a child with \ncroup.\nMETHODS: Parents were randomized to receive story booklets (n=208) or standard \ninformation sheets (n=205) during their ED visit. The primary outcome was change \nin anxiety between triage to ED discharge as measured by the State-Trait Anxiety \nInventory. Follow-up telephone interviews were conducted at 1 and 3 days after \ndischarge, then every other day until 9 days (or until resolution of symptoms), \nand at 1 year. Secondary outcomes included: expected future anxiety, event \nimpact, parental knowledge, satisfaction, decision regret, healthcare \nutilization, time to symptom resolution.\nRESULTS: There was no significant difference in the primary outcome of change in \nparental anxiety between recruitment and ED discharge (change of 5 points for \nthe story group vs. 6 points for the comparison group, p=0.78). The story group \nshowed significantly greater decision regret regarding their decision to go to \nthe ED (p<0.001): 6.7% of the story group vs. 1.5% of the comparison group \nstrongly disagreed with the statement \"I would go for the same choice if I had \nto do it over again\".

        "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: Increasingly, low-income inner-city patients with diabetes \nutilize emergency departments (EDs) for acute and chronic care. We seek to \ndetermine whether a scalable, low-cost, unidirectional, text message-based \nmobile health intervention (TExT-MED) improves clinical outcomes, increases \nhealthy behaviors, and decreases ED utilization in a safety net population.\nMETHODS: We conducted an randomized controlled trial of 128 adult patients with \npoorly controlled diabetes (glycosylated hemoglobin [Hb A1C] level \u0432\u2030\u04908%) in an \nurban, public ED. The TExT-MED group received 2 daily text messages for 6 months \nin English or Spanish. The primary outcome was change in Hb A1C level. Secondary \noutcomes included changes in medication adherence, self-efficacy, performance of \nself-care tasks, quality of life, diabetes-specific knowledge, ED utilization, \nand patient satisfaction.\nRESULTS: Hb A1C level decreased by 1.05% in the TExT-MED group compared with \n0.60% in the controls (\u041e\u201d0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.27 to 1.17) at 6 \nmonths. Secondary outcomes favored the TExT-MED group, with the most sizable \nchange observed in self-reported medication adherence (as measured by the \nMorisky Medication Adherence Scale, an 8-point validated scale with higher \nscores representing better adherence), which improved from 4.5 to 5.4 in the \nTExT-MED group compared with a net decrease of -0.1 in the controls (\u041e\u201d1.1 [95% \nCI 0.1 to 2.1]). Effects were larger among Spanish speakers for both medication \nadherence (1.1 versus -0.3; \u041e\u201d1.4; 95% CI 0.2 to 2.7) and Hb A1C (-1.2% versus \n-0.4%) in the TExT-MED group. The proportion of patients who used emergency \nservices trended lower in the TExT-MED group (35.9% versus 51.6%; \u041e\u201d15.7%; 95% CI \n9.4% to 22%). Overall, 93.6% of respondents enjoyed TExT-MED and 100% would \nrecommend it to family/friends.\nCONCLUSION: The TExT-MED program did not result in a statistically significant \nimprovement in Hb A1C. However, trends toward improvement in the primary outcome \nof Hb A1C and other secondary outcomes, including quality of life, were \nobserved, the most pronounced being improved medication adherence. TExT-MED also \ndecreased ED utilization. These findings were magnified in the Spanish-speaking \nsubgroup. Technologies such as TExT-MED represent highly scalable, low-cost, and \nwidely accessible solutions for safety-net ED populations.",

We seek to \ndetermine whether a scalable, low-cost, unidirectional, text message-based \nmobile health intervention (TExT-MED) improves clinical outcomes, increases \nhealthy behaviors, and decreases ED utilization in a safety net population.\nMETHODS: We conducted an randomized controlled trial of 128 adult patients with \npoorly controlled diabetes (glycosylated hemoglobin [Hb A1C] level \u22658%) in an \nurban, public ED. The TExT-MED group received 2 daily text messages for 6 months \nin English or Spanish. The primary outcome was change in Hb A1C level. Secondary \noutcomes included changes in medication adherence, self-efficacy, performance of \nself-care tasks, quality of life, diabetes-specific knowledge, ED utilization, \nand patient satisfaction.\nRESULTS: Hb A1C level decreased by 1.05% in the TExT-MED group compared with \n0.60% in the controls (\u03940.45; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.27 to 1.17) at 6 \nmonths. Self-reported medication adherence (as measured by the Morisky Medication \nAdherence Scale, an 8-point validated scale with higher scores representing \nbetter adherence) improved from 4.5 to 5.4 in the TExT-MED group compared with \na net decrease of -0.1 in the controls (\u03941.1 [95% CI 0.1 to 2.1]). The \nproportion of patients who used emergency services was 35.9% in the TExT-MED \ngroup versus 51.6% in controls (\u039415.7%; 95% CI 9.4% to 22%). Overall, 93.6% of \nrespondents enjoyed TExT-MED and 100% would recommend it to family/friends.\nCONCLUSION: The TExT-MED program was not more effective on Hb A1C than control \nin patients with poorly controlled diabetes.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Posterior-cruciate-ligament-retaining (PCR) and \nposterior-cruciate-ligament-stabilized (PS) arthroplasties are two major common \npractices in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The hypothesis of the present study \nwas that compared with the PCR technique, the PS technique is associated with a \nhigher amount of postoperative blood loss and greater need for blood transfusion \nin cemented TKA.\nMETHODS: In this prospective, randomized study, 100 patients diagnosed with \nprimary knee osteoarthritis were randomly assigned to either the PCR group \n(Group I) or the PS group (Group II). The exclusion criteria were \nrheumatological joint disease, previous knee surgery, anticoagulant therapy and \nhypertension. There were no significant differences in age, body mass index and \ngender, between the groups. The haemoglobin and haematocrit levels of each \npatient were recorded preoperatively and on postoperative days 1, 3 and 5. The \npostoperative suction drainage and blood transfusion volumes were also recorded.\nRESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in haemoglobin or \nhaematocrit levels between the groups on postoperative days 1, 3 and 5. There \nwere also no statistically significant differences in the total measured blood \nloss volume, postoperative drainage amounts or transfusion rates between the \ngroups.\nCONCLUSION: Use of the PS technique during cemented TKA does not appear to \ninfluence the amount of perioperative blood loss or the need for postoperative \nblood transfusion in general. The clinical relevance of this study is that the \ndifference in blood loss between the PCR and PS techniques does not need to be \nconsidered by surgeons when performing TKA.",

The hypothesis of the present study \nwas that compared with the PCR technique, the PS technique is associated with a \nhigher amount of postoperative blood loss and greater need for blood transfusion \nin cemented TKA.\nMETHODS: In this prospective, randomized study, 100 patients diagnosed with \nprimary knee osteoarthritis were randomly assigned to either the PCR group \n(Group I) or the PS group (Group II). The exclusion criteria were \nrheumatological joint disease, previous knee surgery, anticoagulant therapy and \nhypertension. There were no significant differences in age, body mass index and \ngender, between the groups. The haemoglobin and haematocrit levels of each \npatient were recorded preoperatively and on postoperative days 1, 3 and 5. The \npostoperative suction drainage and blood transfusion volumes were also recorded.\nRESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in haemoglobin or \nhaematocrit levels between the groups on postoperative days 1, 3 and 5. There \nwere also no statistically significant differences in the total measured blood \nloss volume, postoperative drainage amounts or transfusion rates between the \ngroups.\nCONCLUSION: The PS technique was not more effective than the PCR technique in \nreducing postoperative blood loss or blood transfusion requirements in patients \nwith primary knee osteoarthritis undergoing cemented TKA.",

Pain scores of the bupivacaine group were significantly lower than those of the control group the first 12hours postoperatively (all, P<0.001). A significantly lower dose of meperidine was used in the study group than in the control group the first 24hours postoperatively (median, 25 vs. 45mg, P<0.001). Nineteen patients in the study group required meperidine the first day after surgery, as compared to 45 patients in the control group.

All the patients were treated with the same anaesthesia method, surgical team, surgical technique, prosthesis type, and rehabilitation process. American Knee Society Score values and knee flexion degrees were recorded. Isokinetic muscle strength measurements of both knees in flexion and extension were taken using 60\u0412\u00b0 and 180\u0412\u00b0/s angular velocity. The peak torque and total work values, isokinetic muscle strength differences, and total work difference values were calculated for surgically repaired and healthy knees.\nResults:\u0412\u00a0No significant difference in the mean American Knee Society Score values and knee flexion degrees was observed between the two groups. However, using isokinetic evaluation, a significant difference was found in the isokinetic muscle strength differences and total work difference of the flexor muscle between the two groups when patients were tested at 180\u0412\u00b0/s. Less loss of strength was detected in the isokinetic muscle strength differences of the flexor muscle in Group 2 (-4.2%) than in Group 1 (-23.1%).\nConclusion:\u0412\u00a0For patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty, post-operative flexor muscle strength is improved if the knee is flexed during wound closure.",

The control group received physiotherapy and the experimental group received countertraction and physiotherapy. The total treatment time was 20 minutes a day for 5 days per week for 2 weeks. The outcome measures used were goniometer measurements, VAS, and the Oxford Shoulder Score.\n\nResults: Improvements were seen in the scores for shoulder flexion (94.1\u040e \u00b1 19.79\u040e at baseline increased to 161.9\u040e \u00b1 13.05\u040e after intervention), abduction ROM (90.4\u040e \u00b1 21.18\u040e at baseline increased to 154.8\u040e \u00b1 13.21\u040e after intervention), and pain (8.00 \u00b1 0.78 at baseline decreased to 3.48 \u00b1 0.71 after intervention) in the experimental group. Sixty percent of the participants (n = 30) were improved to the fourth stage of satisfactory joint function according to the Oxford Shoulder Score in the experimental group compared with 18% (n = 9) in the control group (p < 0.001).\n\nConclusions: Incorporating shoulder countertraction along with physiotherapy improves shoulder function compared with physiotherapy alone for the treatment of a frozen shoulder.

For secondary outcomes, shoulder flexion improved from 94.1\u00b0 \u00b1 19.79\u00b0 at baseline to 161.9\u00b0 \u00b1 13.05\u00b0 after intervention in the experimental group. Shoulder abduction ROM improved from 90.4\u00b0 \u00b1 21.18\u00b0 at baseline to 154.8\u00b0 \u00b1 13.21\u00b0 after intervention in the experimental group. Pain scores decreased from 8.00 \u00b1 0.78 at baseline to 3.48 \u00b1 0.71 after intervention in the experimental group.\n\nConclusions: Shoulder countertraction along with physiotherapy was more effective than physiotherapy alone on shoulder function in patients with frozen shoulder.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: To compare the clinical outcome between the use of knotless sutures versus knot-tying sutures in arthroscopic Bankart repairs.\n\nMethods: Between January 2007 and January 2011, 87 patients who underwent arthroscopic Bankart repair with the use of knot-tying suture anchors or knotless suture anchors were evaluated, with 45 patients in the knot-tying suture group and 42 patients in the knotless group. Patients were assigned to either group, with odd-numbered patients going to the knot-tying suture arm and even-numbered patients assigned to the knotless arm. Outcomes included the Constant score, the visual analog scale (VAS) score, patient satisfaction score, and range of motion in forward flexion and external rotation with the arm in adduction. Redislocations or subluxations with the 2 techniques was also studied.\n\nResults: Both groups showed a statistically significant improvement between the preoperative and postoperative VAS scores and Constant scores. In the knot-tying suture group, the VAS score improved from 2.5 \u00b1 2.3 to 0.7 \u00b1 0.5 (P < .05) and the Constant score improved from 64 \u00b1 7 to 92 \u00b1 10 (P < .05). In the knotless group, the VAS score improved from 2.8 \u00b1 2.5 to 0.9 \u00b1 0.6 (P < .05), and the Constant score improved from 62 \u00b1 6 to 89 \u00b1 9 (P < .05). The patient satisfaction scores were 6.9 and 7.1 for the knot tying and knotless groups, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found when comparing the outcomes between the 2 groups. The change in the range of forward flexion and external rotation was also similar in the 2 groups. There was also no difference in recurrence or redislocation rates.\n\nConclusions: Both the knot-tying and knotless suture anchors groups showed statistically significant and similar improvement in VAS and Constant scores. Both anchors provided reasonable outcomes. The knotless suture anchor is a good alternative to knot-tying suture anchors so that arthroscopic Bankart repairs can be performed without knot tying.",

Patients were assigned to either group, with odd-numbered patients going to the knot-tying suture arm and even-numbered patients assigned to the knotless arm. The primary outcome was the Constant score. Secondary outcomes included the visual analog scale (VAS) score, patient satisfaction score, range of motion in forward flexion and external rotation with the arm in adduction, and redislocations or subluxations.\n\nResults: No statistically significant differences were found when comparing the Constant scores between the 2 groups. The knot-tying suture group had a postoperative Constant score of 92 \u00b1 10 and the knotless group had a postoperative Constant score of 89 \u00b1 9. For secondary outcomes, the postoperative VAS scores were 0.7 \u00b1 0.5 and 0.9 \u00b1 0.6 for the knot-tying and knotless groups, respectively. The patient satisfaction scores were 6.9 and 7.1 for the knot tying and knotless groups, respectively. The change in the range of forward flexion and external rotation was similar in the 2 groups. There was no difference in recurrence or redislocation rates between groups.\n\nConclusions: Knotless suture anchors were not more effective than knot-tying suture anchors on the Constant score in patients undergoing arthroscopic Bankart repairs.",

Patients with large bony lesions or polytrauma were excluded. The two groups were similar at baseline. Both groups were immobilized for 4 weeks with identical therapy protocols thereafter. Blinded assessments were completed by independent observers for a minimum of 12 months (mean, 25 months; range, 12-43 months).

The primary \noutcome was the Simple Shoulder Test (SST). Secondary outcomes included American \nShoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, Constant score, University of \nCalifornia-Los Angeles (UCLA) score, and Short Form-12 (SF-12) health assessment \nalong with physical examination including range of motion and dynamometer \nstrength testing. Intraoperative data including tear size, repair configuration, \nand concomitant procedures were recorded. Follow-up examination was performed at \nregular intervals up to 2 years. Preoperative imaging was reviewed to classify \nthe acromial morphologic type, acromial angle, and lateral acromial angulation.\nRESULTS: A total of 114 patients were initially enrolled in the study, and 95 \n(83%; 43 nonacromioplasty, 52 acromioplasty) were available for a minimum 2-year \nfollow-up. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics, \nincluding number of tendons torn, repair configuration, concomitant procedures, \nand acromion type and angles. There were no significant differences in functional \noutcomes between nonacromioplasty and acromioplasty groups at any time point.\nCONCLUSION: Acromioplasty was not more effective than nonacromioplasty in \npatients undergoing arthroscopic repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears.",

The Simple \nShoulder Test (SST), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, Constant \nscore, University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) score, and Short Form-12 \n(SF-12) health assessment were collected along with physical examination \nincluding range of motion and dynamometer strength testing. Intraoperative data \nincluding tear size, repair configuration, and concomitant procedures were \nrecorded. Follow-up examination was performed at regular intervals up to 2 \nyears. Preoperative imaging was reviewed to classify the acromial morphologic \ntype, acromial angle, and lateral acromial angulation.\nRESULTS: A total of 114 patients were initially enrolled in the study, and 95 \n(83%; 43 nonacromioplasty, 52 acromioplasty) were available for a minimum 2-year \nfollow-up. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics, \nincluding number of tendons torn, repair configuration, concomitant procedures, \nand acromion type and angles. Within groups, there was a significant (P < .001) \nimprovement in all functional outcome scores from preoperatively to all \nfollow-up time points, including 2 years, for the nonacromioplasty and \nacromioplasty groups (ASES score: 55.1-91.5, 48.8-89.0; Constant score: \n48.3-75.0, 51.9-78.7, respectively). There were no significant differences in \nfunctional outcomes between nonacromioplasty and acromioplasty groups or between \nsubjects with different acromial features at any time point.\nCONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrate no difference in clinical \noutcomes after rotator cuff repair with or without acromioplasty at 2 years \npostoperatively.",

Eligible patients with \nED nausea and vomiting were randomized to receive 4 mg intravenous ondansetron, \n20 mg intravenous metoclopramide, or saline solution placebo. Primary outcome \nwas mean change in visual analog scale (VAS) rating of nausea severity from \nenrollment to 30 minutes after study drug administration. Secondary outcomes \nincluded patient satisfaction, need for rescue antiemetic treatment, and adverse \nevents.\nRESULTS: Of 270 recruited patients, 258 (95.6%) were available for analysis. Of \nthese patients, 87 (33.7%) received ondansetron; 88 (34.1%), metoclopramide; and \n83 (32.2%), placebo. Baseline characteristics between treatment groups and \nrecruitment site were similar. Mean decrease in VAS score was 27 mm (95% \nconfidence interval [CI] 22 to 33 mm) for ondansetron, 28 mm (95% CI 22 to 34 \nmm) for metoclopramide, and 23 mm (95% CI 16 to 30 mm) for placebo. Satisfaction \nwith treatment was reported by 54.1% (95% CI 43.5% to 64.5%), 61.6% (95% CI \n51.0% to 71.4%), and 59.5% (95% CI 48.4% to 69.9%) for ondansetron, \nmetoclopramide, and placebo, respectively; rescue medication was required by \n34.5% (95% CI 25.0% to 45.1%), 17.9% (95% CI 10.8% to 27.2%), and 36.3% (95% CI \n26.3% to 47.2%), respectively. Nine minor adverse events were reported.\nCONCLUSION: Reductions in nausea severity for this adult ED nausea and vomiting \npopulation were similar for 4 mg intravenous ondansetron, 20 mg intravenous \nmetoclopramide, and placebo. There was a trend toward greater reductions in VAS \nratings and a lesser requirement for rescue medication in the antiemetic drug \ngroups, but differences from the placebo group did not reach significance. The \nmajority of patients in all groups were satisfied with treatment.",

Average pain scores during the first 21days after surgery were similar in the two groups. There was no significant difference in the need for adjuvant analgesics, patient satisfaction level, the time to achieve rehabilitation goals, and length of hospital stay.

Forty-six patients scheduled for TKA were randomized into two groups: concomitant administration of FNB and SNB or FNB and LIA. Average pain scores during the first 21days after surgery were similar in the two groups and remained at low level. There was no significant difference in the need for adjuvant analgesics, patient satisfaction level, the time to achieve rehabilitation goals, and length of hospital stay. The LIA offers a potentially safer alternative to SNB as an adjunct to FNB.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of different loads of knee extensor open \nkinetic chain resistance training on anterior knee laxity and function in the \nACL-injured (ACLI) knee.\nMETHODS: Fifty-eight ACLI subjects were randomised to one of three (12-week \nduration) training groups. The STAND group trained according to a standardised \nrehabilitation protocol. Subjects in the LOW and HIGH group trained as did the \nSTAND group but with the addition of seated knee extensor open kinetic chain \nresistance training at loads of 2 sets of 20 repetition maximum (RM) and 20 sets \nof 2RM, respectively. Anterior knee laxity and measurements of physical and \nsubjective function were performed at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks. Thirty-six \nsubjects were tested at both baseline and 12 weeks (STAND n = 13, LOW n = 11, \nHIGH n = 12).\nRESULTS: The LOW group demonstrated a reduction in 133 N anterior knee laxity \nbetween baseline and 12 weeks testing when compared to the HIGH and the STAND \ngroups (p = 0.009). Specifically, the trained-untrained knee laxity decreased an \naverage of approximately 5 mm in the LOW group while remaining the same in the \nother two groups.\nCONCLUSION: Twelve weeks of knee extensor open kinetic chain resistance training \nat loads of 2 sets of 20RM led to a reduction in anterior knee laxity in the \nACLI knee. This reduction in laxity does not appear to offer any significant \nshort-term functional advantages when compared to a standard rehabilitation \nprotocol. These results indicate that knee laxity can be decreased with \nresistance training of the thigh muscles.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of different loads of knee extensor open \nkinetic chain resistance training on anterior knee laxity and function in the \nACL-injured (ACLI) knee.\nMETHODS: Fifty-eight ACLI subjects were randomised to one of three (12-week \nduration) training groups. The STAND group trained according to a standardised \nrehabilitation protocol. Subjects in the LOW and HIGH group trained as did the \nSTAND group but with the addition of seated knee extensor open kinetic chain \nresistance training at loads of 2 sets of 20 repetition maximum (RM) and 20 sets \nof 2RM, respectively. Anterior knee laxity and measurements of physical and \nsubjective function were performed at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks. Thirty-six \nsubjects were tested at both baseline and 12 weeks (STAND n = 13, LOW n = 11, \nHIGH n = 12).\nRESULTS: The LOW group demonstrated a reduction in 133 N anterior knee laxity \nbetween baseline and 12 weeks testing when compared to the HIGH and the STAND \ngroups (p = 0.009). The trained-untrained knee laxity decreased an average of \napproximately 5 mm in the LOW group while remaining the same in the other two \ngroups. No significant differences were found between groups for physical and \nsubjective function measures.\nCONCLUSION: The LOW training was not more effective than the STAND protocol on \nfunction in patients with ACL-injured knees.",

In the TENS group, electrical \nstimulation of the common fibular nerve, which produced a brisk dorsiflexion of \nthe ankle, was performed for the operated leg during surgery. In the control \ngroup, no electrical stimulation was applied. The primary outcome was the incidence of DVT assessed by ultrasonography on post-operative day (POD) 1. Secondary outcomes included serum D-dimer and soluble fibrin monomer complex (SFMC) levels measured before surgery, immediately after surgery, and POD 1.\nRESULTS: The incidence of DVT was 11% (5/45 cases) in the TENS group and 31% (14/45 cases) in the control group (p = 0.02). Immediately after surgery, D-dimer and SFMC levels were lower in the TENS group compared with control (p < 0.05). There were no adverse effects related to TENS.\nCONCLUSIONS: TENS was more effective than no intervention in preventing DVT in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Restoration of biomechanics is a major goal in THA. Imageless \nnavigation enables intraoperative control of leg length equalization and offset \nreconstruction. However, the effect of navigation compared with intraoperative \nfluoroscopy is unclear.\nQUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether intraoperative use of imageless navigation \n(1) improves the relative accuracy of leg length and global and femoral offset \nrestoration; (2) increases the absolute precision of leg length and global and \nfemoral offset equalization; and (3) reduces outliers in a reconstruction zone \nof \u0412\u00b1 5 mm for leg length and global and femoral offset restoration compared with \nintraoperative fluoroscopy during minimally invasive (MIS) THA with the patient \nin a lateral decubitus position.\nMETHODS: In this prospective study a consecutive series of 125 patients were \nrandomized to either navigation-guided or fluoroscopy-controlled THA using \nsealed, opaque envelopes. All patients received the same cementless prosthetic \ncomponents through an anterolateral MIS approach while they were in a lateral \ndecubitus position. Leg length, global or total offset (representing the \ncombination of femoral and acetabular offset), and femoral offset differences \nwere restored using either navigation or fluoroscopy. Postoperatively, residual \nleg length and global and femoral offset discrepancies were analyzed on \nmagnification-corrected radiographs of the pelvis by an independent and blinded \nexaminer using digital planning software. Accuracy was defined as the relative \npostoperative difference between the surgically treated and the unaffected \ncontralateral side for leg length and offset, respectively; precision was \ndefined as the absolute postoperative deviation of leg length and global and \nfemoral offset regardless of lengthening or shortening of leg length and offset \nthroughout the THA. All analyses were performed per intention-to-treat.\nRESULTS: Analyzing the relative accuracy of leg length restoration we found a \nmean difference of 0.2 mm (95% CI, -1.0 to +1.4 mm; p = 0.729) between \nfluoroscopy and navigation, 0.2 mm (95 % CI, -0.9 to +1.3 mm; p = 0.740) for \nglobal offset and 1.7 mm (95 % CI, +0.4 to +2.9 mm; p = 0.008) for femoral \noffset. For the absolute precision of leg length and global and femoral offset \nequalization, there was a mean difference of 1.7 \u0412\u00b1 0.3 mm (p < 0.001) between \nfluoroscopy and navigation. The biomechanical reconstruction with a residual leg \nlength and global and femoral offset discrepancy less than 5 mm and less than 8 \nmm, respectively, succeeded in 93% and 98%, respectively, in the navigation \ngroup and in 54% and 95%, respectively, in the fluoroscopy group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative fluoroscopy and imageless navigation seem equivalent \nin accuracy and precision to reconstruct leg length and global and femoral \noffset during MIS THA with the patient in the lateral decubitus position.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Restoration of biomechanics is a major goal in THA. Imageless \nnavigation enables intraoperative control of leg length equalization and offset \nreconstruction. However, the effect of navigation compared with intraoperative \nfluoroscopy is unclear.\nQUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether intraoperative use of imageless navigation \ncompared with intraoperative fluoroscopy during minimally invasive (MIS) THA \nwith the patient in a lateral decubitus position (1) improves the relative \naccuracy of leg length and global and femoral offset restoration; (2) increases \nthe absolute precision of leg length and global and femoral offset equalization; \nand (3) reduces outliers in a reconstruction zone of \u00b1 5 mm for leg length and \nglobal and femoral offset restoration.\nMETHODS: In this prospective study a consecutive series of 125 patients were \nrandomized to either navigation-guided or fluoroscopy-controlled THA using \nsealed, opaque envelopes. All patients received the same cementless prosthetic \ncomponents through an anterolateral MIS approach while they were in a lateral \ndecubitus position. The primary outcome was relative accuracy of leg length \nrestoration. Secondary outcomes included global offset accuracy, femoral offset \naccuracy, absolute precision of leg length and offset equalization, and outliers \nin reconstruction zones. Postoperatively, residual leg length and global and \nfemoral offset discrepancies were analyzed on magnification-corrected \nradiographs of the pelvis by an independent and blinded examiner using digital \nplanning software. Accuracy was defined as the relative postoperative difference \nbetween the surgically treated and the unaffected contralateral side for leg \nlength and offset, respectively; precision was defined as the absolute \npostoperative deviation of leg length and global and femoral offset regardless \nof lengthening or shortening of leg length and offset throughout the THA. All \nanalyses were performed per intention-to-treat.\nRESULTS: For the primary outcome of relative accuracy of leg length restoration, \nthere was a mean difference of 0.2 mm (95% CI, -1.0 to +1.4 mm; p = 0.729) \nbetween fluoroscopy and navigation. For secondary outcomes, global offset showed \na mean difference of 0.2 mm (95% CI, -0.9 to +1.3 mm; p = 0.740) and femoral \noffset showed a mean difference of 1.7 mm (95% CI, +0.4 to +2.9 mm; p = 0.008). \nFor the absolute precision of leg length and global and femoral offset \nequalization, there was a mean difference of 1.7 \u00b1 0.3 mm (p < 0.001) between \nfluoroscopy and navigation. The biomechanical reconstruction with a residual leg \nlength and global and femoral offset discrepancy less than 5 mm and less than 8 \nmm, respectively, succeeded in 93% and 98%, respectively, in the navigation \ngroup and in 54% and 95%, respectively, in the fluoroscopy group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Imageless navigation was not more effective than intraoperative \nfluoroscopy for leg length restoration in patients undergoing MIS THA with the \npatient in the lateral decubitus position.",

        "abstract": "Objective\nIntravenous morphine has been used as a common method of pain control in emergency care. Nebulized\u0412\u00a0fentanyl\u0412\u00a0is also an effective temporary substitute. This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of nebulized fentanyl with intravenous (IV) morphine on management of acute limb pain.\nMethods\nThis was a placebo-controlled, double-blind\u0412\u00a0randomized clinical trial. Ninety emergency department patients with moderate to severe pain aged 15 to 50 years were blocked randomized and enrolled in this study. Forty-seven patients in the experimental group received nebulized fentanyl (4\u0412\u00a0\u041e\u0458g/kg) and IV normal saline as placebo, and the remaining 43 patients in the control group received IV morphine (0.1 mg/kg) and nebulized normal saline as placebo. All participants' pain scores were assessed by Numerical Rating Scale before and after intervention at 5-, 10-, 15-, 30-, 45-, and 60-minute intervals. Patients' vital sign and possible\u0412\u00a0adverse effects\u0412\u00a0were recorded respectively. Finally, all participants were assessed for their satisfaction.\nResults\nThe mean initial pain score in the experimental group was 8.7 and 8.4 in the control group (P\u0412\u00a0= .1). Pain relief in both groups after 5 and 10 minutes were similar (P\u0412\u00a0= .72). Although the pain relief was significantly greater with fentanyl at 15 minutes, this difference is not clinically significant. Pain management in both groups was successful and was more than 3 scores reduction in Numerical Rating Scale. Patient satisfaction in both groups was similar. No adverse effects were reported in the experimental group.\nConclusion\nThis study suggests that nebulized fentanyl is a rapid, safe, and effective method for temporary control of acute limb pain in emergency department patients.",

        "abstract": "Objective\nIntravenous morphine has been used as a common method of pain control in emergency care. Nebulized fentanyl is also an effective temporary substitute. This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of nebulized fentanyl with intravenous (IV) morphine on management of acute limb pain.\nMethods\nThis was a placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized clinical trial. Ninety emergency department patients with moderate to severe pain aged 15 to 50 years were blocked randomized and enrolled in this study. Forty-seven patients in the experimental group received nebulized fentanyl (4 \u03bcg/kg) and IV normal saline as placebo, and the remaining 43 patients in the control group received IV morphine (0.1 mg/kg) and nebulized normal saline as placebo. The primary outcome was pain relief measured by Numerical Rating Scale. All participants' pain scores were assessed by Numerical Rating Scale before and after intervention at 5-, 10-, 15-, 30-, 45-, and 60-minute intervals. Patients' vital signs and possible adverse effects were recorded respectively. Patient satisfaction was also assessed.\nResults\nThe mean initial pain score in the experimental group was 8.7 and 8.4 in the control group (P = .1). Pain relief in both groups after 5 and 10 minutes were similar (P = .72). Pain relief was significantly greater with fentanyl at 15 minutes, but this difference was not clinically significant. Pain reduction was more than 3 scores in Numerical Rating Scale in both groups. Patient satisfaction in both groups was similar. No adverse effects were reported in the experimental group.\nConclusion\nNebulized fentanyl was not more effective than IV morphine in patients with acute limb pain.",

The primary \nendpoint was defined as meeting predetermined discharge eligibility criteria \nwithin 6 hours of study drug administration. Discharge criteria included \nimprovement of edema, stable vital signs, absence of stridor, absence of dyspnea \nor use of accessory muscles during respiration, absence of drooling, and ability \nto drink without difficulty.\nRESULTS: An interim analysis showed that a high percentage of subjects met the \nprimary endpoint, and the study was halted. Overall, 79 subjects were randomized \nand 76 had data for analysis. Most had mild (45%) or moderate (42%) ACEIA. The \ndischarge eligibility endpoint was met by 72% of the placebo group and 85%, 89%, \nand 89% of the ecallantide 10-, 30-, and 60-mg groups, respectively. This \ndifference in meeting discharge eligibility endpoint criteria between treatment \ngroups was not statistically significant. The incidence of treatment-emergent \nadverse events was similar between placebo and active-treatment groups.\nCONCLUSION: The addition of ecallantide to standard therapy does not appear to \nimprove angioedema compared with placebo in ED patients with ACEIA. Our data \nsuggest that most ED patients presenting with mild to moderate ACEIA are likely \nto meet our discharge eligibility criteria within 6 hours of treatment, \nregardless of intervention. Further studies to assess the utility of ecallantide \nin patients with more severe angioedema may be useful. No new safety signals \nrelated to ecallantide administration were identified.",

This study assesses the accuracy of EMS providers' GCS scoring, as well as the improvement in GCS score assessment with the use of a scoring aid.\nMethods: This randomized, controlled study was conducted in the emergency department (ED) of an urban academic trauma center. Emergency medical technicians or paramedics who transported a patient to the ED were randomly assigned one of 9 written scenarios, either with or without a GCS scoring aid. The primary outcome was accuracy of GCS scoring compared to expert consensus. Scenarios were created by consensus of expert attending emergency medicine, EMS, and neurocritical care physicians, with universal consensus agreement on GCS scores. \u03c7\u00b2 and Student's t tests were used to compare groups.\nResults: Of 180 participants, 178 completed the study. Overall, 73 of 178 participants (41%) gave a GCS score that matched the expert consensus score. GCS score was correct in 22 of 88 (25%) cases without the scoring aid and in 51 of 90 (57%) cases with the scoring aid. Most (69%) of the total GCS scores fell within 1 point of the expert consensus GCS score. Subcomponent accuracy was eye 62%, verbal 70%, and motor 51%.\nConclusion: The GCS scoring aid was not more effective than no scoring aid in improving accuracy of EMS GCS score assessments in this study population.",

        "abstract": "Study objective:\u0412\u00a0Emergency medical services (EMS) personnel frequently use the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) to assess injured and critically ill patients. This study assesses the accuracy of EMS providers' GCS scoring, as well as the improvement in GCS score assessment with the use of a scoring aid.\nMethods:\u0412\u00a0This randomized, controlled study was conducted in the emergency department (ED) of an urban academic trauma center. Emergency medical technicians or paramedics who transported a patient to the ED were randomly assigned one of 9 written scenarios, either with or without a GCS scoring aid. Scenarios were created by consensus of expert attending emergency medicine, EMS, and neurocritical care physicians, with universal consensus agreement on GCS scores. \u041f\u2021(2) And Student's t tests were used to compare groups.\nResults:\u0412\u00a0Of 180 participants, 178 completed the study. Overall, 73 of 178 participants (41%) gave a GCS score that matched the expert consensus score. GCS score was correct in 22 of 88 (25%) cases without the scoring aid. GCS was correct in 51 of 90 (57%) cases with the scoring aid. Most (69%) of the total GCS scores fell within 1 point of the expert consensus GCS score. Differences in accuracy were most pronounced in scenarios with a correct GCS score of 12 or below. Subcomponent accuracy was eye 62%, verbal 70%, and motor 51%.\nConclusion:\u0412\u00a0In this study, 60% of EMS participants provided inaccurate GCS score estimates. Use of a GCS scoring aid improved accuracy of EMS GCS score assessments.",

(DePuy Int, Warsaw, IN, USA) \nhumeral head resurfacing implants (HHRIs).\nMETHODS: The study randomly allocated 32 patients (13 women), mean age 63 years \n(range, 39-82 years), with shoulder osteoarthritis to a Copeland (n = 14) or \nGlobal C.A.P. (n = 18) HHRI. Patients were monitored for 2 years with \nradiostereometry, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, Constant Shoulder Score \n(CSS), and the Western Ontario Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder Index (WOOS). LGHO \nwas measured preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively.\nRESULTS: At 2 years, total translation (TT) was 0.48 mm (standard deviation \n[SD], 0.21 mm) for the Copeland and 0.82 mm (SD, 0.46 mm) for the Global C.A.P. \n(P = .06). Five HHRI were revised, and in the interval before the last follow-up \n(revision or 2 years), TT of 0.58 mm (SD, 0.61 mm) for revised HHRI was higher \n(P = .02) than TT of 0.22 mm (SD, 0.17 mm) in nonrevised HHRI. A comparison of \nTT at the last follow-up (revision or 2 years) found no difference between the \nHHRIs (P = .12). Periprosthetic BMD decreased initially but increased \ncontinuously after 6 months for both HHRIs. At 2 years, BMD was 48% higher \naround the Copeland HHRI (P = .005). The mean difference in LGHO was \nsignificantly higher for the Copeland than for the Global C.A.P. HHRI (P = .02). \nClinical results evaluated with CSS and WOOS improved over time for both implant \ngroups (P < .01), with no differences between the groups.\nCONCLUSION: Both implants had only little migration and good clinical results. \nPeriprosthetic BMD and LGHO both increased for the Copeland HHRI more than for \nthe Global C.A.P HHRI.",

To test this hypothesis, the clinical effect of the combined treatment with hyaluronic acid injection alone in patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis as compared in this prospective single-blinded randomized trial.\n\nMethods: This study included 70 patients. Group 1 (n = 35) received intraarticular hyaluronic acid injections only, whereas group 2 (n = 35) received intraarticular hyaluronic acid injections combined with a single local injection of corticosteroid-lidocaine. Injections were administered to the most painful areas of the anterior or posterior medial condyle of the femur or tibia. The outcome was measured by independent assessors (blinded to treatment) using a linear VAS pain scale and WOMAC and HSS knee scores. Assessments were performed at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, 12, 26, and 52 weeks.\n\nResults: During the first 3 weeks, group 2 patients showed significantly better all scores than did group 1 patients (p < 0.01). However, no significant differences were detected at 6, 12, 26 or 52 weeks (n.s.).\n\nConclusion: The combined treatment was not more effective than intraarticular hyaluronic acid alone in patients with knee osteoarthritis.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: A local injection of corticosteroid-lidocaine into the periarticular soft tissue structures is used commonly for rapid pain relief. It is hypothesized that knee pain associated with knee osteoarthritis would be relieved quickly and effectively in patients receiving intraarticular hyaluronic acid combined with a periarticular lidocaine-corticosteroid injection. To test this hypothesis, the clinical effect of the combined treatment with hyaluronic acid injection alone in patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis as compared in this prospective single-blinded randomized trial.\n\nMethods: This study included 70 patients. Group 1 (n = 35) received intraarticular hyaluronic acid injections only, whereas group 2 (n = 35) received intraarticular hyaluronic acid injections combined with a single local injection of corticosteroid-lidocaine. Injections were administered to the most painful areas of the anterior or posterior medial condyle of the femur or tibia. The outcome was measured by independent assessors (blinded to treatment) using a linear VAS pain scale and WOMAC and HSS knee scores. Assessments were performed at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, 12, 26, and 52 weeks.\n\nResults: During the first 3 weeks, group 2 patients showed significantly better all scores than did group 1 patients (p < 0.01). However, no significant differences were detected at 6, 12, 26 or 52 weeks (n.s.).\n\nConclusion: The combined treatment may lead to earlier pain relief compared with intraarticular hyaluronic acid alone in patients with knee osteoarthritis and can be considered a useful adjunctive treatment modality. This combined method may provide early return to patient's daily activity.",

This study was completed in 2 large academic \nEDs. Bupivacaine or normal saline solution was delivered intranasally (0.3 mL \nper side) with the Tx360 device. Pain and nausea were measured at 0, 5, and 15 \nminutes by a 100-mm visual analog scale. The primary endpoint was a 50% \nreduction in pain at 15 minutes. Telephone follow-up assessed 24-hour pain and \nnausea through a 0- to 10-point verbal scale and adverse effects.\nRESULTS: The median reported baseline pain in the bupivacaine group was 80 mm \n(IQR 66 mm - 93 mm) and 78.5 mm (IQR 64 mm to 91.75 mm) in the normal saline \nsolution group. A 50% reduction in pain was achieved in 48.8% of the bupivacaine \ngroup (20/41 patients) versus 41.3% in the normal saline solution group (19/46 \npatients), for an absolute risk difference of 7.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] \n-13% to 27.1%). As a secondary outcome, at 24 hours, more patients in the \nbupivacaine group were headache free (24.7% difference; 95% CI 2.6% to 43.6%) \nand more were nausea free (16.9% difference; 95% CI 0.8% to 32.5%).\nCONCLUSION: For patients with acute anterior headache, sphenopalatine ganglion \nblock with the Tx360 device with bupivacaine did not result in a significant \nincrease in the proportion of patients achieving a greater than or equal to 50% \nreduction in headache severity at 15 minutes compared with saline solution \napplied in the same manner.",

This study was completed in 2 large academic \nEDs. Bupivacaine or normal saline solution was delivered intranasally (0.3 mL \nper side) with the Tx360 device. Pain and nausea were measured at 0, 5, and 15 \nminutes by a 100-mm visual analog scale. The primary endpoint was a 50% \nreduction in pain at 15 minutes. Telephone follow-up assessed 24-hour pain and \nnausea through a 0- to 10-point verbal scale and adverse effects.\nRESULTS: The median reported baseline pain in the bupivacaine group was 80 mm \n(IQR 66 mm - 93 mm) and 78.5 mm (IQR 64 mm to 91.75 mm) in the normal saline \nsolution group. A 50% reduction in pain was achieved in 48.8% of the bupivacaine \ngroup (20/41 patients) versus 41.3% in the normal saline solution group (19/46 \npatients), for an absolute risk difference of 7.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] \n-13% to 27.1%). At 24 hours, 24.7% more patients in the bupivacaine group were \nheadache free (95% CI 2.6% to 43.6%) and 16.9% more were nausea free (95% CI \n0.8% to 32.5%).\nCONCLUSION: Sphenopalatine ganglion block with bupivacaine was not more effective \non 50% reduction in pain at 15 minutes than normal saline solution in patients \nwith acute anterior headache.",

All patients had either a full-thickness or \nhigh-grade (>50%) RC tear, ACJ tenderness, arthritic change visible on plain \nradiographs, and a positive ACJ lidocaine injection test the day before surgery. \nPatients were randomized into 2 groups: DCR and RC repair (DCR+RCR group) and RC \nrepair only (isolated RCR).

A convenience sample of patients aged 18 to 59 years with acute abdominal, flank, low back, or extremity pain were enrolled. Subjects were consented and randomized to intravenous LDK (0.3mg/kg) or intravenous MOR (0.1mg/kg). Our primary outcome was the maximum change in NRS scores. Secondary outcomes included time to achieve maximum reduction in NRS pain scores, vital signs, adverse events, and provider and nurse satisfaction scores. A sample size of 20 subjects per group was calculated based on an 80% power to detect a 2-point change in NRS scores between treatment groups with estimated SDs of 2 and an \u03b1 of .05, using a repeated-measures linear model.\n\nResults: Forty-five subjects were enrolled (MOR 21, LDK 24). Demographic variables and baseline NRS scores (7.1 vs 7.1) were similar. Ketamine was not superior to MOR in the maximum change of NRS pain scores, MOR=5 (confidence interval, 6.6-3.5) and LDK=4.9 (confidence interval, 5.8-4). The time to achieve maximum reduction in NRS pain scores was at 5 minutes for LDK and 100 minutes for MOR. Vital signs, adverse events, provider, and nurse satisfaction scores were similar between groups.\n\nConclusion: Low-dose ketamine was not more effective on maximum change in NRS pain scores than morphine in patients with acute pain in the emergency department.",

Earlier transfusion with higher blood product ratios (plasma, platelets, and red blood cells), defined as damage control resuscitation, has been associated with improved outcomes; however, there have been no large multicenter clinical trials.\n\nObjective: To determine the effectiveness and safety of transfusing patients with severe trauma and major bleeding using plasma, platelets, and red blood cells in a 1:1:1 ratio compared with a 1:1:2 ratio.\n\nDesign, setting, and participants: Pragmatic, phase 3, multisite, randomized clinical trial of 680 severely injured patients who arrived at 1 of 12 level I trauma centers in North America directly from the scene and were predicted to require massive transfusion between August 2012 and December 2013.\n\nInterventions: Blood product ratios of 1:1:1 (338 patients) vs 1:1:2 (342 patients) during active resuscitation in addition to all local standard-of-care interventions (uncontrolled).\n\nMain outcomes and measures: Primary outcomes were 24-hour and 30-day all-cause mortality. Prespecified ancillary outcomes included time to hemostasis, blood product volumes transfused, complications, incidence of surgical procedures, and functional status.\n\nResults: No significant differences were detected in mortality at 24 hours (12.7% in 1:1:1 group vs 17.0% in 1:1:2 group; difference, -4.2% [95% CI, -9.6% to 1.1%]; P = .12) or at 30 days (22.4% vs 26.1%, respectively; difference, -3.7% [95% CI, -10.2% to 2.7%]; P = .26). Exsanguination occurred in 9.2% of the 1:1:1 group vs 14.6% in the 1:1:2 group (difference, -5.4% [95% CI, -10.4% to -0.5%]; P = .03). Hemostasis was achieved in 86% of the 1:1:1 group vs 78% in the 1:1:2 group (P = .006). The 1:1:1 group received more plasma (median of 7 U vs 5 U, P < .001) and platelets (12 U vs 6 U, P < .001) and similar amounts of red blood cells (9 U) over the first 24 hours. No differences between the 2 groups were found for the 23 prespecified complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure, venous thromboembolism, sepsis, and transfusion-related complications.\n\nConclusions and relevance: The 1:1:1 ratio was not more effective on 24-hour and 30-day mortality than the 1:1:2 ratio in patients with severe trauma and major bleeding.",

Earlier transfusion with higher blood product ratios (plasma, platelets, and red blood cells), defined as damage control resuscitation, has been associated with improved outcomes; however, there have been no large multicenter clinical trials.\n\nObjective: To determine the effectiveness and safety of transfusing patients with severe trauma and major bleeding using plasma, platelets, and red blood cells in a 1:1:1 ratio compared with a 1:1:2 ratio.\n\nDesign, setting, and participants: Pragmatic, phase 3, multisite, randomized clinical trial of 680 severely injured patients who arrived at 1 of 12 level I trauma centers in North America directly from the scene and were predicted to require massive transfusion between August 2012 and December 2013.\n\nInterventions: Blood product ratios of 1:1:1 (338 patients) vs 1:1:2 (342 patients) during active resuscitation in addition to all local standard-of-care interventions (uncontrolled).\n\nMain outcomes and measures: Primary outcomes were 24-hour and 30-day all-cause mortality. Prespecified ancillary outcomes included time to hemostasis, blood product volumes transfused, complications, incidence of surgical procedures, and functional status.\n\nResults: No significant differences were detected in mortality at 24 hours (12.7% in 1:1:1 group vs 17.0% in 1:1:2 group; difference, -4.2% [95% CI, -9.6% to 1.1%]; P = .12) or at 30 days (22.4% vs 26.1%, respectively; difference, -3.7% [95% CI, -10.2% to 2.7%]; P = .26). Exsanguination, which was the predominant cause of death within the first 24 hours, was significantly decreased in the 1:1:1 group (9.2% vs 14.6% in 1:1:2 group; difference, -5.4% [95% CI, -10.4% to -0.5%]; P = .03). More patients in the 1:1:1 group achieved hemostasis than in the 1:1:2 group (86% vs 78%, respectively; P = .006). Despite the 1:1:1 group receiving more plasma (median of 7 U vs 5 U, P < .001) and platelets (12 U vs 6 U, P < .001) and similar amounts of red blood cells (9 U) over the first 24 hours, no differences between the 2 groups were found for the 23 prespecified complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure, venous thromboembolism, sepsis, and transfusion-related complications.\n\nConclusions and relevance: Among patients with severe trauma and major bleeding, early administration of plasma, platelets, and red blood cells in a 1:1:1 ratio compared with a 1:1:2 ratio did not result in significant differences in mortality at 24 hours or at 30 days. However, more patients in the 1:1:1 group achieved hemostasis and fewer experienced death due to exsanguination by 24 hours. Even though there was an increased use of plasma and platelets transfused in the 1:1:1 group, no other safety differences were identified between the 2 groups.",

Delayed initiation of neuroprotective agents has hindered earlier phase 3 trials of neuroprotective agents.\n\nMethods: We randomly assigned patients with suspected stroke to receive either intravenous magnesium sulfate or placebo, beginning within 2 hours after symptom onset. A loading dose was initiated by paramedics before the patient arrived at the hospital, and a 24-hour maintenance infusion was started on the patient's arrival at the hospital. The primary outcome was the degree of disability at 90 days, as measured by scores on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater disability).\n\nResults: Among the 1700 enrolled patients (857 in the magnesium group and 843 in the placebo group), the mean (\u00b1SD) age was 69\u00b113 years, 42.6% were women, and the mean pretreatment score on the Los Angeles Motor Scale of stroke severity (range, 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater motor deficits) was 3.7\u00b11.3. The final diagnosis of the qualifying event was cerebral ischemia in 73.3% of patients, intracranial hemorrhage in 22.8%, and a stroke-mimicking condition in 3.9%.

There was no significant shift in the distribution of 90-day disability outcomes on the global modified Rankin scale between patients in the magnesium group and those in the placebo group (P=0.28 by the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test); mean scores at 90 days did not differ between the magnesium group and the placebo group (2.7 in each group, P=1.00). No significant between-group differences were noted with respect to mortality (15.4% in the magnesium group and 15.5% in the placebo group, P=0.95) or all serious adverse events.\n\nConclusions: Prehospital initiation of magnesium sulfate therapy was safe and allowed the start of therapy within 2 hours after the onset of stroke symptoms, but it did not improve disability outcomes at 90 days.",

There was no significant shift in the distribution of 90-day disability outcomes on the global modified Rankin scale between patients in the magnesium group and those in the placebo group (P=0.28 by the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test); mean scores at 90 days were 2.7 in the magnesium group and 2.7 in the placebo group (P=1.00). Mortality was 15.4% in the magnesium group and 15.5% in the placebo group (P=0.95). No significant between-group differences were noted with respect to all serious adverse events.\n\nConclusions: Magnesium sulfate was not more effective than placebo in patients with suspected stroke.",

To increase the likelihood that good alignment will be achieved during surgery, smart tools such as robotics or patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) have been introduced.\nQuestions/purposes:\u0412\u00a0We hypothesized that UKA performed with PSI would result in improved level gait as ascertained with three-dimensional analysis, implant positioning, and patient-reported outcomes measured by a validated scoring system when compared with conventional instrumentation 3 months and 1 year after surgery.\nMethods:\u0412\u00a0We randomized 60 patients into two groups using either the PSI technique or a conventional technique. All patients were operated on using the same technique and the same cemented metal-backed implant. Mean age of the patients was 63 \u0412\u00b1 4 years (range, 54-72 years) and mean body mass index was 28 \u0412\u00b1 3 kg/m(2). Patients were evaluated preoperatively, at 3 months, and 1 year after surgery by an independent observer blind to the type of technique. Gait parameters were assessed with three-dimensional analysis during level walking preoperatively and at 1 year, frontal and sagittal position of the implant was evaluated on full-length radiographs at 3 months, and subjective functional outcome and quality of life using routine questionnaires (SF-12, new Knee Society Score [KSS], Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) at 3 months and 1 year. This study had 80% power to detect a 15% difference in walking speed at the p < 0.05 level.\nResults:\u0412\u00a0One year after surgery, there were no differences between the two groups in the analyzed gait spatiotemporal parameters, respectively, for PSI UKA and conventional UKA : double limb support 31% (25%-54%) versus 30% (23%-56%; p = 0.67) and walking speed (1.59 m/s [0.86-1.87 m/s] versus 1.57 m/s [0.71-1.96 m/s]; p = 0.41). No difference was observed between the two groups in terms of lower limb alignment (PSI group 178\u0412\u00b0 \u0412\u00b1 3\u0412\u00b0, conventional group 178\u0412\u00b0 \u0412\u00b1 4\u0412\u00b0; p = 0.24) or implant positioning on mediolateral and anteroposterior radiographs. There were no differences in the functional score between the PSI and conventional TKA groups at 3 months and 1 year after surgery: KSS objective knee scores (PSI: 85 \u0412\u00b1 8 points at 3 months, 87 \u0412\u00b1 5 points at 1 year and conventional instrumentation: 82 \u0412\u00b1 8 points at 3 months 83 \u0412\u00b1 6 points at 1 year; p = 0.10) and functional activity scores were similar in both group (PSI: 71 \u0412\u00b1 12 points at 3 months and 74 \u0412\u00b1 7 points at 1 year versus conventional group: 73 \u0412\u00b1 11 points at 3 months and 75 \u0412\u00b1 6 at 1 year; p = 0.9).\nConclusions:\u0412\u00a0Our observations suggest that PSI may confer small, if any, advantage in alignment, pain, or function after UKA. This argument can therefore not be used to justify the extra cost and uncertainty related to this technique.",

Patients were randomized to receive ketamine \nat 0.3 mg/kg or morphine at 0.1 mg/kg by intravenous push during 3 to 5 minutes. \nEvaluations occurred at 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. Primary outcome was \nreduction in pain at 30 minutes. Secondary outcome was the incidence of rescue \nanalgesia at 30 and 60 minutes.\nRESULTS: Forty-five patients per group were enrolled in the study. The primary \nchange in mean pain scores was not significantly different in the ketamine and \nmorphine groups: 8.6 versus 8.5 at baseline (mean difference 0.1; 95% confidence \ninterval -0.46 to 0.77) and 4.1 versus 3.9 at 30 minutes (mean difference 0.2; \n95% confidence interval -1.19 to 1.46; P=.97). There was no difference in the \nincidence of rescue fentanyl analgesia at 30 or 60 minutes. No statistically \nsignificant or clinically concerning changes in vital signs were observed. No \nserious adverse events occurred in either group. Patients in the ketamine group \nreported increased minor adverse effects at 15 minutes post-drug administration.\nCONCLUSION: Subdissociative intravenous ketamine was not more effective than \nmorphine for reduction in pain at 30 minutes in ED patients with moderate to \nsevere acute pain.",

Patients were randomized to receive ketamine \nat 0.3 mg/kg or morphine at 0.1 mg/kg by intravenous push during 3 to 5 minutes. \nEvaluations occurred at 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. Primary outcome was \nreduction in pain at 30 minutes. Secondary outcome was the incidence of rescue \nanalgesia at 30 and 60 minutes.\nRESULTS: Forty-five patients per group were enrolled in the study. The primary \nchange in mean pain scores was not significantly different in the ketamine and \nmorphine groups: 8.6 versus 8.5 at baseline (mean difference 0.1; 95% confidence \ninterval -0.46 to 0.77) and 4.1 versus 3.9 at 30 minutes (mean difference 0.2; \n95% confidence interval -1.19 to 1.46; P=.97). There was no difference in the \nincidence of rescue fentanyl analgesia at 30 or 60 minutes. No statistically \nsignificant or clinically concerning changes in vital signs were observed. No \nserious adverse events occurred in either group. Patients in the ketamine group \nreported increased minor adverse effects at 15 minutes post-drug administration.\nCONCLUSION: Subdissociative intravenous ketamine administered at 0.3 mg/kg \nprovides analgesic effectiveness and apparent safety comparable to that of \nintravenous morphine for short-term treatment of acute pain in the ED.",

Febrile children were randomly assigned to the intervention (clinical \ndecision model; n = 219) or the control group (usual care; n = 220). The \nclinical decision model included clinical symptoms, vital signs, and C-reactive \nprotein and provided high/low-risks for \"pneumonia\" and \"other SBI\". Nurses were \nguided by the intervention to initiate additional tests for high-risk children. \nThe clinical decision model was evaluated by 1) \narea-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic-curve (AUC) to indicate \ndiscriminative ability and 2) feasibility, to measure nurses' compliance to \nmodel recommendations. Primary patient outcome was defined as correct SBI \ndiagnoses. Secondary process outcomes were defined as length of stay; diagnostic \ntests; antibiotic treatment; hospital admission; revisits and medical costs.\nRESULTS: The decision model had discriminative ability for both pneumonia \n(n = 33; AUC 0.83 (95% CI 0.75-0.90)) and other SBI (n = 22; AUC 0.81 (95% CI \n0.72-0.90)). Compliance to model recommendations was 86%. No differences \nin correct SBI determination were observed. Application of the clinical decision \nmodel resulted in less full-blood counts (14% vs. 22%, p-value < 0.05) and more \nurine-dipstick testing (71% vs. 61%, p-value < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: The clinical decision model was not more effective than usual care \nfor correct SBI diagnoses in febrile children attending the emergency department.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of a clinical decision model for febrile \nchildren at risk for serious bacterial infections (SBI) attending the emergency \ndepartment (ED).\nMETHODS: Randomized controlled trial with 439 febrile children, aged 1 month-16 \nyears, attending the pediatric ED of a Dutch university hospital during \n2010-2012. Febrile children were randomly assigned to the intervention (clinical \ndecision model; n = 219) or the control group (usual care; n = 220). The \nclinical decision model included clinical symptoms, vital signs, and C-reactive \nprotein and provided high/low-risks for \"pneumonia\" and \"other SBI\". Nurses were \nguided by the intervention to initiate additional tests for high-risk children. \nThe clinical decision model was evaluated by 1) \narea-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic-curve (AUC) to indicate \ndiscriminative ability and 2) feasibility, to measure nurses' compliance to \nmodel recommendations. Primary patient outcome was defined as correct SBI \ndiagnoses. Secondary process outcomes were defined as length of stay; diagnostic \ntests; antibiotic treatment; hospital admission; revisits and medical costs.\nRESULTS: The decision model had good discriminative ability for both pneumonia \n(n = 33; AUC 0.83 (95% CI 0.75-0.90)) and other SBI (n = 22; AUC 0.81 (95% CI \n0.72-0.90)). Compliance to model recommendations was high (86%). No differences \nin correct SBI determination were observed. Application of the clinical decision \nmodel resulted in less full-blood-counts (14% vs. 22%, p-value < 0.05) and more \nurine-dipstick testing (71% vs. 61%, p-value < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: In contrast to our expectations no substantial impact on patient \noutcome was perceived. The clinical decision model preserved, however, good \ndiscriminatory ability to detect SBI, achieved good compliance among nurses and \nresulted in a more standardized diagnostic approach towards febrile children, \nwith less full blood-counts and more rightfully urine-dipstick testing.",

        "abstract": "New insert types have been developed to improve clinical and functional outcome in mobile bearing (MB-TKA) and fixed bearing total knee arthroplasty (FB-TKA). A prospective single blinded randomised controlled clinical trial was performed to evaluate 2 types of MB-TKA inserts and 2 types of FB-TKA inserts of the Genesis II prosthesis (Smith & Nephew) in 146 patients with 5-years follow-up. A significant difference (P=.042) between the MB-TKA inserts was found in KSS function scores, but clinical significance is expected to be limited. Goniometry, temporal gait parameters and QoL were similar in all groups. Survival was significantly better (P=.047) for FB-TKA. The comparable outcome and higher revision rate in MB-TKA indicate that FB-TKA may be preferential for the Genesis II implant system.",

Recent studies have \ndescribed a positive effect of lateralization of the center of rotation, \nespecially on postoperative rotational function. The goal of this study is to \ncompare the outcome of non-lateralized versus lateralized RSA with particular \nregard to rotational function in patients with CTA.\nMETHODS: Thirty-four patients underwent implantation of RSA either with \nlateralization (n\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a017) or without lateralization (n\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a017) by use of a 1-cm \nautologous bone graft (\"bony increased offset\") of the humeral head for CTA. \nClinical outcomes were measured with the Constant score; the Disabilities of the \nArm, Shoulder and Hand score; and the Activities of Daily Living \nRequiring\u0412\u00a0External Rotation score, as well as measurement of external rotation \nand determination of the external rotation lag sign with the arm at the side and \nat 90\u0412\u00b0 of abduction, at 1 year postoperatively and at final follow-up. Computed \ntomography scan evaluation was performed in all patients preoperatively and at 1 \nyear postoperatively to assess preoperative fatty infiltration of the rotator \ncuff and bony integration of the graft postoperatively.\nRESULTS: At final follow-up, all patients showed significantly increased \nfunctional results. There were no significant differences in the evaluated \nparameters. If patients with degenerative changes of the teres minor were \nexcluded, the lateralized group showed significantly increased external \nrotation. Bony integration of the graft could be verified on postoperative \ncomputed tomography scans in all patients.\nCONCLUSION: RSA with bony lateralization shows a trend toward improved external \nrotation in lateralized RSA, with a statistically significant improvement in \nexternal rotation in patients with an intact teres minor.",

It also \nevaluates the need for additional doses of analgesics in the first 24 hours of \ndischarge from emergency department (ED).\nMETHODS: Adult (>18 years old) patients with soft tissue injuries were enrolled \nin a teaching urban ED. Subjects were randomly allocated to receive a single \ndose of oral oxycodone (5 mg) or oral naproxen (250 mg). Pain scores and drugs' \nadverse effects were assessed before, 30 minutes, and 60 minutes after \nmedication.\nOUTCOME: efficacy in pain control (reduction in pain scale >2 points) and safety \n(rate of side effects). The need for additional pain medication after discharge \nwas assessed by follow-up phone call 24 hours after discharge.\nRESULTS: A total of 150 patients were enrolled. Pain scores were similar in \noxycodone vs naproxen groups before (6.21 \u0412\u00b1 0.9 in vs 6.0 \u0412\u00b1 1.0), 30 minutes \n(4.5 \u0412\u00b1 1.4 vs 4.4 \u0412\u00b1 1.2), and 60 minutes (2.5 \u0412\u00b1 1.3 in vs 2.6 \u0412\u00b1 1.3) after \nmedication, respectively. Twelve (16.0%) patients in oral oxycodone group and 5 \n(6.6%) patients in naproxen group needed more analgesics in first 24 hours after \nED discharge. Adverse effects were more common in oxycodone group (statistically \nsignificant difference). The most common adverse effects in oxycodone group were \nnausea, (13.3%); vomiting, (8.0%); dizziness, (5.3%); drowsiness, 3 (4.0%); and \npruritis, (2.7%).\nCONCLUSION: Oral oxycodone is as effective as naproxen in soft tissue injury \npain control but has a less favorable safety profile.",

Subjects were randomly allocated to receive a single \ndose of oral oxycodone (5 mg) or oral naproxen (250 mg). Pain scores and drugs' \nadverse effects were assessed before, 30 minutes, and 60 minutes after \nmedication.\nOUTCOME: efficacy in pain control (reduction in pain scale >2 points) and safety \n(rate of side effects). The need for additional pain medication after discharge \nwas assessed by follow-up phone call 24 hours after discharge.\nRESULTS: A total of 150 patients were enrolled. Pain scores were similar in \noxycodone vs naproxen groups before (6.21 \u0412\u00b1 0.9 in vs 6.0 \u0412\u00b1 1.0), 30 minutes \n(4.5 \u0412\u00b1 1.4 vs 4.4 \u0412\u00b1 1.2), and 60 minutes (2.5 \u0412\u00b1 1.3 in vs 2.6 \u0412\u00b1 1.3) after \nmedication, respectively. Twelve (16.0%) patients in oral oxycodone group and 5 \n(6.6%) patients in naproxen group needed more analgesics in first 24 hours after \nED discharge. Adverse effects were more common in oxycodone group. The most common adverse effects in oxycodone group were \nnausea, (13.3%); vomiting, (8.0%); dizziness, (5.3%); drowsiness, 3 (4.0%); and \npruritis, (2.7%).\nCONCLUSION: Oral oxycodone was not more effective than naproxen in patients with soft tissue injury.",

Neurological adverse events included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, \nhemicraniectomy, neurological deterioration and neurological death. \nCardiopulmonary adverse events included pulmonary edema/congestive heart \nfailure, acute coronary syndromes, atrial fibrillation, pneumonia and pulmonary \nthromboembolism.\nRESULTS: Among 830 patients, the rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in the first \n24h was 2.9% (24/830) and was more common in the ALB treated subjects \n(RR = 2.4, CI95 1.01-5.8). The rate of pulmonary edema/CHF in the first 48h was \n7.9% (59/830) and was more common among ALB treated subjects (RR = 10.7, CI95 \n4.3-26.6).

We sought to describe the neurological and \ncardiopulmonary adverse events in the ALIAS Part 2 Multicenter Trial.\nMETHODS: Ischemic stroke patients, aged 18-83 and a baseline NIHSS \u0432\u2030\u0490 6, were \nrandomized to treatment with ALB or saline control within 5 hours of stroke \nonset. Neurological adverse events included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, \nhemicraniectomy, neurological deterioration and neurological death. \nCardiopulmonary adverse events included pulmonary edema/congestive heart \nfailure, acute coronary syndromes, atrial fibrillation, pneumonia and pulmonary \nthromboembolism.\nRESULTS: Among 830 patients, neurological and cardiopulmonary adverse events \nwere not differentially associated with poor outcome between ALB and saline \ncontrol subjects. The rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in the first \n24h was low overall (2.9%, 24/830) but more common in the ALB treated subjects \n(RR = 2.4, CI95 1.01-5.8). The rate of pulmonary edema/CHF in the first 48h was \n7.9% (59/830) and was more common among ALB treated subjects (RR = 10.7, CI95 \n4.3-26.6); this complication was expected and was satisfactorily managed with \nmandated diuretic administration and intravenous fluid guidelines. Troponin \nelevations in the first 48h were common, occurring without ECG change or cardiac \nsymptoms in 52 subjects (12.5%).\nCONCLUSIONS: ALB therapy was associated with an increase in symptomatic ICH and \npulmonary edema/congestive heart failure but this did not affect final outcomes. \nTroponin elevation occurs routinely in the first 48 hours after acute ischemic \nstroke.",

The primary outcome was ultrasound-assessed repair \nintegrity at 6 months after repair. Secondary outcomes included pain scores, \nshoulder range of motion, and shoulder strength.

It was found that patients taking zolpidem achieved greater improvement in quality of life and reported better satisfaction. Patients in the intervention group had lower pain score and took less antiemetics. Moreover, a significant correlation between sleep quality and ROM was detected.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Arthroscopy has become a standard method of treatment for a variety \nof intra-articular hip disorders. While most arthroscopic hip procedures are \nperformed as outpatient surgeries, patients can still experience significant \npostoperative pain and opioid-associated side effects.\nPURPOSE: The potential benefits of a preoperative femoral nerve block (FNB) in \nhip arthroscopy were explored in a previous retrospective review. The study \nobjective was to confirm these findings in a prospective randomized study.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\nMETHODS: Fifty patients undergoing hip arthroscopy were included in this \nprospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial that was patient-, \noperator-, and assessor-blinded. Patients received either a preoperative \nultrasound-guided FNB with 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine (FNB group) or normal \nsaline (control group). Nerve blockade was confirmed via standardized sensory \ntesting before the induction of general anesthesia. The primary endpoint was \ncumulative consumption of oral morphine equivalent at 24 hours after discharge. \nSecondary endpoints included opioid use at various time points, pain scores, \nQuality of Recovery (QoR-27) score, incidence of nausea and vomiting, time to \ndischarge, block-related complications, falls at 24 hours, and patient \nsatisfaction.\nRESULTS: Fifty patients completed the study, including 27 in the FNB group and \n23 in the control group. Most patient characteristics were statistically similar \nbetween groups except for operative time, which was longer in the control group. \nCumulative oral morphine consumption was lower in the FNB group at 48 hours; \nthere was no difference at 24 hours or 7 days postoperatively. Pain scores were \nsignificantly lower up to 6 hours postoperatively in the FNB group compared with \ncontrol; however, rebound pain was observed at 24 hours after discharge in \npatients who received FNB. There was no difference in most secondary outcomes. \nImportantly, a total of 6 patients in the FNB group reported falls (without \ninjury) within the first 24 hours postoperatively compared with none in the \ncontrol group. Patient satisfaction with pain control was high in both groups at \nall time points.\nCONCLUSION: Preoperative FNB may improve early pain control after hip \narthroscopy. However, given the observed risk of falls, the routine use of FNB \nfor outpatient hip arthroscopy cannot be recommended.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Arthroscopy has become a standard method of treatment for a variety \nof intra-articular hip disorders. While most arthroscopic hip procedures are \nperformed as outpatient surgeries, patients can still experience significant \npostoperative pain and opioid-associated side effects.\nPURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of preoperative femoral nerve block (FNB) compared to placebo in patients undergoing hip arthroscopy.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\nMETHODS: Fifty patients undergoing hip arthroscopy were included in this \nprospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial that was patient-, \noperator-, and assessor-blinded. Patients received either a preoperative \nultrasound-guided FNB with 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine (FNB group) or normal \nsaline (control group). Nerve blockade was confirmed via standardized sensory \ntesting before the induction of general anesthesia. The primary endpoint was \ncumulative consumption of oral morphine equivalent at 24 hours after discharge. \nSecondary endpoints included opioid use at various time points, pain scores, \nQuality of Recovery (QoR-27) score, incidence of nausea and vomiting, time to \ndischarge, block-related complications, falls at 24 hours, and patient \nsatisfaction.\nRESULTS: Fifty patients completed the study, including 27 in the FNB group and \n23 in the control group. Most patient characteristics were statistically similar \nbetween groups except for operative time, which was longer in the control group. \nThere was no difference in cumulative oral morphine consumption at 24 hours between groups. Cumulative oral morphine consumption was lower in the FNB group at 48 hours; \nthere was no difference at 7 days postoperatively. Pain scores were \nsignificantly lower up to 6 hours postoperatively in the FNB group compared with \ncontrol; however, rebound pain was observed at 24 hours after discharge in \npatients who received FNB. There was no difference in most secondary outcomes. \nA total of 6 patients in the FNB group reported falls (without \ninjury) within the first 24 hours postoperatively compared with none in the \ncontrol group. Patient satisfaction with pain control was high in both groups at \nall time points.\nCONCLUSION: Preoperative FNB was not more effective than placebo on cumulative oral morphine consumption at 24 hours in patients undergoing hip arthroscopy.",

However, incidence \nof mortality and morbidity remains high in this patient group. Rapid targeted \nbrain hypothermia induction, together with prompt correction of the underlying \ncause may improve outcomes in these patients. This study investigates the \nefficacy of Rhinochill, an intranasal cooling device over Blanketrol, a surface \ncooling device in inducing TH in cardiac arrest patients within the cardiac \ncatheter laboratory.\nMETHODS: 70 patients were randomized to TH induction with either Rhinochill or \nBlanketrol. Primary outcome measures were time to reach tympanic \u0432\u2030\u00a434 \u0412\u00b0C from \nrandomisation as a surrogate for brain temperature and oesophageal \u0432\u2030\u00a434 \u0412\u00b0C from \nrandomisation as a measurement of core body temperature. Secondary outcomes \nincluded first hour temperature drop, length of stay in intensive care unit, \nhospital stay, neurological recovery and all-cause mortality at hospital \ndischarge.\nRESULTS: There was no difference in time to reach \u0432\u2030\u00a434 \u0412\u00b0C between Rhinochill and \nBlanketrol (Tympanic \u0432\u2030\u00a434 \u0412\u00b0C, 75 vs. 107 mins; p=0.101; Oesophageal \u0432\u2030\u00a434 \u0412\u00b0C, 85 \nvs. 115 mins; p=0.151). Tympanic temperature dropped significantly with \nRhinochill in the first hour (1.75 vs. 0.94 \u0412\u00b0C; p<0.001). No difference was \ndetected in any other secondary outcome measures. Catheter laboratory-based TH \ninduction resulted in a survival to hospital discharge of 67.1%.\nCONCLUSION: In this study, Rhinochill was not found to be more efficient than \nBlanketrol for TH induction, although there was a non-significant trend in \nfavour of Rhinochill that potentially warrants further investigation with a \nlarger trial.",

        "abstract": "Background: Olecranon bursitis might be a minor problem in the outpatient clinic but relatively be common to occur. However, there are few well-designed studies comparing approaches to treatment.\n\nQuestions/purposes: (1) Which treatment (compression bandaging with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], aspiration, or aspiration with steroid injections) is associated with the highest likelihood of resolution of nonseptic olecranon bursitis? (2) Which treatment is associated with earliest resolution of symptoms? (3) What factors are associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks?\n\nMethods: We enrolled 133 patients from two centers; after applying prespecified exclusions (septic bursitis or concomitant inflammatory arthritis, intraarticular elbow pathology, recent aspiration or steroid injection done elsewhere, and refusal to participate), 90 patients were randomly allocated to receive compression bandaging with NSAIDs (C), aspiration (A), or aspiration with steroid injection (AS) groups (30 patients in each). The groups were similar at baseline in terms of age and gender. Seven patients (four from Group A and three from Group AS) were lost to followup. All patients were followed up weekly for 4 weeks, and the same treatment procedure was repeated if the bursitis recurred with any substantial fluid collection. At 4 weeks, the state of resolution and pain visual analog scale (VAS) were evaluated. Failed resolution was defined as presence of persistent olecranon bursal fluid collection at Week 4 after the initiation of the treatment; on the contrary, if bursal fluid collection was clinically reduced or completely disappeared by the end of Week 4, the treatment was considered successful. We compared the proportion of resolution by Week 4 and the median times to resolution among the treatment groups. In addition, we evaluated whether the resolution affected pain VAS and what factors were associated with the resolution.\n\nResults: There were no differences in the proportion of patients whose bursitis resolved by Week 4 among the three treatment groups (Group C: 25 of 30 [83%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.27-1.72], p = 0.580; Group A: 17 of 26 [65%], relative risk of resolution failure: 2.19 [95% CI, 0.98-4.87], p = 0.083; Group AS: 23 of 27 [85%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.59 [95% CI, 0.22-1.63], p = 0.398) (p = 0.073). Steroid injection after aspiration (Group AS) was associated with the earliest resolution (2.3 weeks [range, 1-4 weeks]) when compared with aspiration alone (Group A; 3.1 weeks [range, 2-4 weeks]) and compression bandaging with NSAIDs (Group C; 3.2 weeks [range, 2-4 weeks]), p = 0.015). Longer duration of symptoms before treatment was the only factor associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks (failed resolution: 6 weeks [range, 2-9 weeks]; successful resolution: 4 weeks [range, 0.4-6 weeks]; p = 0.008).\n\nConclusions: With the numbers available, there were no differences in efficacy when compression bandaging with NSAIDs, aspiration, and aspiration with steroid injection were compared. However, we were powered only to detect a 30% difference, meaning that if there were a smaller difference in efficacy among the groups, we might not have detected it in a study of this size. Our data can be used as pilot data to power future prospective (and likely multicenter) trials. Because olecranon bursitis can recur, and because treatments like aspiration and aspiration with steroid injection can cause complications, unless future trials demonstrate clear efficacy advantages of aspiration and/or injection both at short and longer terms, we suggest that compression bandaging and a short course of NSAIDs may offer the most appropriate balance of safety and efficacy.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: The aim of the present study was to examine changes in radiological variables in a prospective randomized study comparing opening wedge (OW) and closing wedge (CW) techniques of high tibial osteotomy (HTO). Our hypothesis was that there would be no differences in joint line angles or correction accuracy between the two groups, that patellar height would increase after CW HTO and decrease after OW HTO, and that leg length and posterior tibial slope would decrease after CW HTO and increase after OW HTO.\n\nMethods: Radiological data were collected from 70 patients participating in an ongoing prospective randomized clinical trial comparing OW and CW HTOs. Digital standing hip-knee-ankle (HKA) radiographs as well as lateral radiographs in 30\u040e of flexion were obtained preoperatively and at 6 months for each patient. Joint line angles, HKA angle, leg length, Insall-Salvati index, Miura-Kawamura index and posterior tibial slope were measured using medical planning software. The complete preoperative radiological examinations of the first 50 patients were used in a study of intra- and inter-rater reliability of the measurements.\n\nResults: The mean posterior slope was reduced by 2.5\u040e in CW HTO, whereas it remained unchanged in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Mean leg length decreased 5.7 mm in CW HTO and increased 3.1 mm in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Changes in joint line angles, patellar height indexes and the correction accuracy showed no significant differences comparing the two techniques. Frontal plane reliability measurement intra- and inter-rater intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) varied from 0.81 to 0.99. Sagittal plane intra- and inter-rater ICC varied from 0.60 to 0.87. Posterior tibial slope intra- and inter-rater ICC showed the lowest values (0.70 and 0.60, respectively) corresponding to a smallest real difference of 4.5\u040e and 5.5\u040e, respectively.\n\nConclusions: Posterior tibial slope and leg length changes were significantly different in CW compared to OW HTOs. We recommend that possible alterations in tibial slope and leg length are considered when the technique of HTO is to be chosen. Landmark-based medical planning software shows good reliability and can be used in preoperative planning and postoperative evaluations of HTOs.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: The aim of the present study was to examine changes in radiological variables in a prospective randomized study comparing opening wedge (OW) and closing wedge (CW) techniques of high tibial osteotomy (HTO). Our hypothesis was that there would be no differences in joint line angles or correction accuracy between the two groups, that patellar height would increase after CW HTO and decrease after OW HTO, and that leg length and posterior tibial slope would decrease after CW HTO and increase after OW HTO.\n\nMethods: Radiological data were collected from 70 patients participating in an ongoing prospective randomized clinical trial comparing OW and CW HTOs. Digital standing hip-knee-ankle (HKA) radiographs as well as lateral radiographs in 30\u00b0 of flexion were obtained preoperatively and at 6 months for each patient. Joint line angles, HKA angle, leg length, Insall-Salvati index, Miura-Kawamura index and posterior tibial slope were measured using medical planning software. The complete preoperative radiological examinations of the first 50 patients were used in a study of intra- and inter-rater reliability of the measurements.\n\nResults: The mean posterior slope was reduced by 2.5\u00b0 in CW HTO, whereas it remained unchanged in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Mean leg length decreased 5.7 mm in CW HTO and increased 3.1 mm in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Changes in joint line angles, patellar height indexes and the correction accuracy showed no significant differences comparing the two techniques. Frontal plane reliability measurement intra- and inter-rater intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) varied from 0.81 to 0.99. Sagittal plane intra- and inter-rater ICC varied from 0.60 to 0.87. Posterior tibial slope intra- and inter-rater ICC showed the lowest values (0.70 and 0.60, respectively) corresponding to a smallest real difference of 4.5\u00b0 and 5.5\u00b0, respectively.\n\nConclusions: Opening wedge HTO was not more effective than closing wedge HTO in patients undergoing high tibial osteotomy for radiological variables including joint line angles, correction accuracy, and patellar height indexes.",

The primary and secondary outcome measures were insulin sensitivity assessed using a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test and hepatic triglyceride content with magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Exploratory outcomes were cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity and MRI and dual x-ray absorptiometry-derived measures of adiposity.\n\nResults: The study had 96% retention and attendance was 61\u00b121% and 55\u00b124% in the high- and moderate-intensity ET arms. Intention-to-treat analyses revealed that, at follow-up, insulin sensitivity was not different between high-intensity (-1.0 mU kg(-1) min(-1); 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.6, +1.4 mU kg(-1) min(-1)) and moderate-intensity (+0.26 mU kg(-1) min(-1); 95% CI: -1.3, +1.8 mU kg(-1) min(-1)) ET arms compared with controls (interaction, P=0.97). Similarly, hepatic triglyceride at follow-up was not different in high-intensity (-1.7% fat/water (F/W); 95% CI: -7.0, +3.6% F/W) and moderate-intensity (-0.40% FW; 95% CI: -6.0, +5.3% F/W) ET compared with controls. Both high intensity (+4.4 ml per kg-FFM (fat-free mass) per minute; 95% CI: 1.7, 7.1 ml kg-FFM(-1) min(-1)) and moderate intensity (+4.4 ml kg-FFM(-1) min(-1); 95% CI: 1.6, 7.3 ml kg-FFM(-1) min(-1)) increased cardiorespiratory fitness, relative to controls (interaction P<0.001).\n\nConclusions: ET improves cardiorespiratory fitness among obese adolescents; however, owing to lack of compliance, the influence of exercise intensity on insulin sensitivity and hepatic triglycerides remains unclear.",

The primary outcome measure was insulin sensitivity assessed using a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. The secondary outcome measure was hepatic triglyceride content with magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Exploratory outcomes were cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity and MRI and dual x-ray absorptiometry-derived measures of adiposity.\n\nResults: The study had 96% retention and attendance was 61\u00b121% and 55\u00b124% in the high- and moderate-intensity ET arms. Intention-to-treat analyses revealed that, at follow-up, insulin sensitivity was not different between high-intensity (-1.0 mU kg(-1) min(-1); 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.6, +1.4 mU kg(-1) min(-1)) and moderate-intensity (+0.26 mU kg(-1) min(-1); 95% CI: -1.3, +1.8 mU kg(-1) min(-1)) ET arms compared with controls (interaction, P=0.97). Similarly, hepatic triglyceride at follow-up was not different in high-intensity (-1.7% fat/water (F/W); 95% CI: -7.0, +3.6% F/W) and moderate-intensity (-0.40% FW; 95% CI: -6.0, +5.3% F/W) ET compared with controls. Both high intensity (+4.4 ml per kg-FFM (fat-free mass) per minute; 95% CI: 1.7, 7.1 ml kg-FFM(-1) min(-1)) and moderate intensity (+4.4 ml kg-FFM(-1) min(-1); 95% CI: 1.6, 7.3 ml kg-FFM(-1) min(-1)) increased cardiorespiratory fitness, relative to controls (interaction P<0.001).\n\nConclusions: High-intensity ET was not more effective on insulin sensitivity than moderate-intensity ET in overweight adolescents.",

Patients were \nrandomized to either group 1 (PRP, n\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u203020) or group 2 (no PRP [control group], \nn\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u203020). Patients in group 1 received a perioperative PRP infiltration at the \nrotator cuff defect, whereas the control group did not. Patients were assessed \nclinically preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and 1 \nyear. The Constant score, Simple Shoulder Test, and QuickDASH (short version of \nDisabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire) were used as outcome \nmeasures. The evolution of the cuff defect was evaluated on sonography at 3 and \n6 months and with magnetic resonance imaging after 1 year.\nRESULTS: All patients improved significantly after surgery (P\u0432\u0402\u2030<\u0432\u0402\u2030.05). There was \nno difference in clinical outcome or rotator cuff healing between groups. We \nobserved a high rate of persistent rotator cuff defects after 1 year in both \ngroups. The presence of residual cuff defects did not influence the clinical \noutcome.\nCONCLUSION: Arthroscopic needling is an operation with a predictive, good \nclinical outcome. We found a high rate of persistent rotator cuff defects after \n1 year. This study could not identify any beneficial effect of the addition of \nPRP on rotator cuff healing.",

The aim of this study is to investigate the \neffectiveness of SRS reapplication after draping to reduce the incidence of SSI \nafter TJA.\nMETHODS: Six hundred patients undergoing primary TJA between 2010 and 2011 at a \nsingle institution were recruited and randomly assigned to one of 2 groups. The \npatients in the intervention group (n\u0412\u00a0= 300) received SPS that included alcohol \nand povidone-iodine before draping and an additional SPS by iodine povacrylex \nand isopropyl alcohol before application of the final adhesive drape, whereas \nthe patients in the control group (n\u0412\u00a0= 300) received a single SPS with alcohol \nand povidone-iodine before draping. Randomization was performed by an opaque \nenvelope, and the rates of SSI and blistering were compared between groups.\nRESULTS: Five seventy-seven patients completed the study and were included in \nthe final analysis. There was a significant reduction in the incidence of \nsuperficial SSI for the intervention group (1.8%, 5 of 283) compared to the \ncontrol group (6.5%, 19 of 294, P\u0412\u00a0= .02). There were 2 (0.7%, 2 of 294) deep \nincisional SSIs in the control group, and 2 (0.7%, 2 of 283) organ-space SSIs in \nthe intervention group (P\u0412\u00a0= 1.00). In addition, skin blistering was lower in the \nintervention group (3.5%, 10 of 283) vs the control group (6.5%, 19 of 294), but \nthis difference also did not reach statistical significance (P\u0412\u00a0= .13).\nCONCLUSION: Reapplication of an SPS after draping and before the application of \niodophor-impregnated incisive draping resulted in a significant reduction in the \nrate of SSI in patients undergoing elective TJA.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preventing surgical site infection (SSI) after total joint \narthroplasty (TJA) is a high priority and is partly linked to the efficacy of \nsurgical site preparation solutions (SPSs) in reducing the number of pathogens \non the skin before incision. The aim of this study is to investigate the \neffectiveness of SPS reapplication after draping to reduce the incidence of SSI \nafter TJA.\nMETHODS: Six hundred patients undergoing primary TJA between 2010 and 2011 at a \nsingle institution were recruited and randomly assigned to one of 2 groups. The \npatients in the intervention group (n = 300) received SPS that included alcohol \nand povidone-iodine before draping and an additional SPS by iodine povacrylex \nand isopropyl alcohol before application of the final adhesive drape, whereas \nthe patients in the control group (n = 300) received a single SPS with alcohol \nand povidone-iodine before draping. Randomization was performed by an opaque \nenvelope, and the rates of SSI and blistering were compared between groups. The \nprimary outcome was overall SSI rate.\nRESULTS: Five seventy-seven patients completed the study and were included in \nthe final analysis. Overall SSI occurred in 9 of 283 patients (3.2%) in the \nintervention group compared to 21 of 294 patients (7.1%) in the control group \n(P = .06). Superficial SSI occurred in 5 of 283 patients (1.8%) in the \nintervention group compared to 19 of 294 patients (6.5%) in the control group \n(P = .02). There were 2 (0.7%) deep incisional SSIs in the control group, and 2 \n(0.7%) organ-space SSIs in the intervention group (P = 1.00). Skin blistering \noccurred in 10 of 283 patients (3.5%) in the intervention group versus 19 of 294 \npatients (6.5%) in the control group (P = .13).\nCONCLUSION: The SPS reapplication was not more effective than single SPS \napplication in reducing overall SSI in patients undergoing elective TJA.",

Fat taste thresholds (lowest detectable fat concentration), fat perception (discrimination ability), preference, and anthropometry were assessed at baseline and week 6.\n\nResults: Consumption of a LF diet (n = 26) and PC diet (n = 27) reduced participants' weight (P < 0.001), with no significant differences between groups (LF, -2.9%, PC, -2.7%). Both diets resulted in a decrease in fat taste thresholds (P = 0.014), and the effect tended to be stronger in the LF diet vs. the PC diet (P = 0.060). The ability to perceive different fat concentrations in foods was increased after the LF diet only (P = 0.017); however, food preference did not change on either diet.\n\nConclusions: A PC and LF diet both increase fat taste sensitivity in people with overweight/obesity, with the strongest effect after the LF diet.",

This prospective \nrandomized study comparing navigation-assisted TKA and conventional TKA reported \nthe clinical and radiological outcomes at a follow-up of 9\u0412\u00a0years. The purpose of \nthis study was to compare the clinical and radiological outcomes for patients \nwho underwent navigation-assisted TKA or conventional TKA after long-term \nfollow-up.\nMETHODS: A total of 80 patients (88 knees) were available for physical and \nradiological examination 9\u0412\u00a0years after TKA. Clinical outcomes were evaluated \nusing HSS, WOMAC, and KS function and pain scores. And radiological outcomes of \nthe component loosening and its survivorship during 9-year follow-up were also \nevaluated.\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences in the field of clinical outcomes \nbetween the two groups. In terms of radiological outcomes, the navigation group \nhad fewer alignment outliers (7.3 vs 20\u0412\u00a0%, p\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a00.006). Although the clinical \noutcomes showed no differences between the two groups, the survival rate was \nslightly better in the navigation group than in the conventional group without \nstatistical significance (best-case scenario 100 vs 95.3\u0412\u00a0%, n.s., worst-case \nscenario 95.6 vs 88.4\u0412\u00a0%, n.s.).\nCONCLUSION: Navigation-assisted TKA produced better alignment outcomes and \nbetter survival rates than conventional instruments although some of the \ndifferences were not statistically significant.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Well balanced knees with good alignment are essential for a \nwell-functioning TKA with long survival of its implants. The purpose of \nthis study was to compare the clinical and radiological outcomes for patients \nwho underwent navigation-assisted TKA or conventional TKA after long-term \nfollow-up.\nMETHODS: A total of 80 patients (88 knees) were available for physical and \nradiological examination 9 years after TKA. Clinical outcomes were evaluated \nusing HSS, WOMAC, and KS function and pain scores. Radiological outcomes of \nthe component loosening and its survivorship during 9-year follow-up were also \nevaluated.\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences in clinical outcomes \nbetween the two groups. In terms of radiological outcomes, the navigation group \nhad fewer alignment outliers (7.3 vs 20%, p = 0.006). The survival rate \nshowed no statistically significant difference between groups (best-case scenario 100 vs 95.3%, n.s., worst-case \nscenario 95.6 vs 88.4%, n.s.).\nCONCLUSION: Navigation-assisted TKA was not more effective than conventional TKA in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.",

We examined whether a novel suspended release local anesthetic, liposomal bupivacaine (LB) would improve pain control and decrease opioid consumption after TKA compared to a standard periarticular injection in opioid-dependent patients.\n\nMethods: Thirty-eight patients undergoing TKA were randomly assigned to receive either a periarticular injection (PAI) with LB (n = 20) or with a standard PAI (including a combination of ropivacaine, clonidine, Toradol, Epinepherine, and saline; n = 18) as part of a multimodal pain management approach.

However, when examining pain levels separately for each day, pain visual analog scale scores were reported higher in post operative day 1 in the LB group (P = .033).\n\nConclusions: LB was not found to be superior to standard PAI in opioid-dependent patients undergoing TKA.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The rotator cuff tendon is known to exert a shear force between the \nsuperficial and deep layers. Owing to this characteristic, separate repair of \ndelaminated rotator cuff tears has been introduced for the restoration of the \nphysiological biomechanics of the rotator cuff. However, whether conventional en \nmasse repair or separate repair is superior is controversial in terms of \noutcomes.\nPURPOSE: To compare clinical outcomes between conventional en masse repair and \nseparate double-layer double-row repair for the treatment of delaminated rotator \ncuff tears.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled study; Level of evidence, 2.\nMETHODS: Between August 2007 and March 2014, a total of 82 patients who \nunderwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of a delaminated tear were enrolled \nand randomized into 2 groups. In group 1 (n = 48), arthroscopic conventional en \nmasse repair was performed. In group 2 (n = 34), separate double-layer \ndouble-row repair was performed. The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, \nConstant score, Simple Shoulder Test score, visual analog scale (VAS) score \nfor pain, and range of motion (ROM) were assessed before surgery; at 3, 6, and 12 \nmonths after surgery; and at the last follow-up visit. Magnetic resonance \nimaging (MRI) was performed at 12 months postoperatively to examine the retear \nrate and pattern.\nRESULTS: There was no significant difference between groups in the preoperative \ndemographic data, including patient age, sex, symptom duration, tear size, and \nfunctional scores (P > .05).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The rotator cuff tendon is known to exert a shear force between the \nsuperficial and deep layers. Owing to this characteristic, separate repair of \ndelaminated rotator cuff tears has been introduced for the restoration of the \nphysiological biomechanics of the rotator cuff. However, whether conventional en \nmasse repair or separate repair is superior is controversial in terms of \noutcomes.\nPURPOSE: To compare clinical outcomes between conventional en masse repair and \nseparate double-layer double-row repair for the treatment of delaminated rotator \ncuff tears.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled study; Level of evidence, 2.\nMETHODS: Between August 2007 and March 2014, a total of 82 patients who \nunderwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of a delaminated tear were enrolled \nand randomized into 2 groups. In group 1 (n = 48), arthroscopic conventional en \nmasse repair was performed. In group 2 (n = 34), separate double-layer \ndouble-row repair was performed. The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, \nConstant score, Simple Shoulder Test score, and visual analog scale (VAS) score \nfor pain and range of motion (ROM) were assessed before surgery; at 3, 6, and 12 \nmonths after surgery; and at the last follow-up visit. Magnetic resonance \nimaging (MRI) was performed at 12 months postoperatively to examine the retear \nrate and pattern.\nRESULTS: There was no significant difference between groups in the preoperative \ndemographic data, including patient age, sex, symptom duration, tear size, and \nfunctional scores (P > .05). The mean follow-up period was 25.9 \u0412\u00b1 1.2 months. \nSignificant improvements in functional and pain scores were observed in both \ngroups at the last follow-up visit. However, no significant differences in \nfunctional scores and ROM were found between the 2 groups at each time point, \nexcept that group 2 had significantly lower VAS pain scores (P < .05) at 3, 6, \nand 12 months postoperatively. Eight (17%) of 48 patients in group 1 and 6 (18%) \nof 34 patients in group 2 showed retears on MRI at 12-month follow-up (P > .05).\nCONCLUSION: Both conventional en masse repair and separate double-layer \ndouble-row repair were effective in improving clinical outcomes in the treatment \nof delaminated rotator cuff tears. Lower pain scores were seen in patients who \nunderwent separate double-layer double-row repair.",

Patients \nwith isolated subscapularis tears or osteoarthritis were excluded. Finally, 86 \npatients (Deb in 28, BTo in 27, and BTd in 31) were analyzed (mean follow-up, \n22.1 \u00b1 7.72 months; mean age, 58.98 \u00b1 7.8 years). Pain; functional, clinical, \nand radiologic outcomes; and the strength index of elbow flexion and forearm \nsupination were analyzed.\nRESULTS: Pain, range of motion, and functional scores improved postoperatively \nin all 3 groups, with no significant differences across groups. At the 6-month \nfollow-up, 8 patients reported cramping pain (5 Deb patients, 2 BTo patients, \nand 1 BTd patient), but the pain improved in most patients over time (with \ncramping pain reported by zero Deb patients, 1 BTo patient, and 1 BTd patient at \nfinal follow-up). Bicipital groove tenderness improved in the BTo group \npostoperatively (P = .006). The Popeye deformity was noted in 10 patients \n(37.0%) in the BTo group, 8 (25.8%) in the BTd group, and 2 (7.1%) in the Deb \ngroup (P = .029). On radiologic examination, the presence of tenodesis of the \nbiceps tendons on the bicipital groove showed low agreement with the presence of \nthe Popeye deformity (observed in 13 of 20 patients with the deformity, 65%). \nOn strength index analysis, the BTo group showed lower forearm supination \nstrength (0.877 \u00b1 0.44) compared with that in the other groups (1.29 \u00b1 0.525 in \nthe Deb group and 1.12 \u00b1 0.451 in the BTd group, P = .049).\nCONCLUSIONS: Simple debridement was not more effective than biceps tenotomy or \nbiceps tenodesis in patients with concomitant superior labrum-biceps complex \nlesions and rotator cuff tears.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To compare the clinical outcomes in patients with concomitant superior \nlabrum-biceps complex (SLBC) lesions and rotator cuff tears who underwent \narthroscopic rotator cuff repair, according to 3 different treatment methods \n(simple debridement, biceps tenotomy, or biceps tenodesis) for the SLBC lesions.\nMETHODS: One hundred twenty patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff \nrepair with SLBC lesions (biceps partial tears <50%, partial pulley lesions, and \ntype II SLAP lesions) were enrolled in this prospective comparative study and \nrandomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups (simple debridement [Deb], biceps \ntenotomy only [BTo], or biceps tenodesis with one suture anchor [BTd]). Patients \nwith isolated subscapularis tears or osteoarthritis were excluded. Finally, 86 \npatients (Deb in 28, BTo in 27, and BTd in 31) were analyzed (mean follow-up, \n22.1 \u0412\u00b1 7.72 months; mean age, 58.98 \u0412\u00b1 7.8 years). Pain; functional, clinical, \nand radiologic outcomes; and the strength index of elbow flexion and forearm \nsupination were analyzed.\nRESULTS: Pain, range of motion, and functional scores significantly improved \npostoperatively in all 3 groups, with no significant differences across groups. \nAt the 6-month follow-up, 8 patients reported cramping pain (5 Deb patients, 2 \nBTo patients, and 1 BTd patient), but the pain improved in most patients over \ntime (with cramping pain reported by zero Deb patients, 1 BTo patient, and 1 BTd \npatient at final follow-up). Bicipital groove tenderness significantly improved \nin the BTo group postoperatively (P\u0412\u00a0= .006). The Popeye deformity was noted in \n10 patients (37.0%) in the BTo group, 8 (25.8%) in the BTd group, and only 2 \n(7.1%) in the Deb group (P\u0412\u00a0= .029). On radiologic examination, the presence of \ntenodesis of the biceps tendons on the bicipital groove showed low agreement \nwith the presence of the Popeye deformity (observed in 13 of 20 patients with \nthe deformity, 65%). On strength index analysis, the BTo group showed lower \nforearm supination strength (0.877 \u0412\u00b1 0.44) compared with that in the other \ngroups (1.29 \u0412\u00b1 0.525 in the Deb group and 1.12 \u0412\u00b1 0.451 in the BTd group, P\u0412\u00a0= \n.049).\nCONCLUSIONS: All 3 treatments improved pain and function. Simple debridement \nshowed the lowest risk of the Popeye deformity and preserved forearm supination \nstrength. Biceps tenotomy and tenodesis may be preferable for selected patients: \nbiceps tenotomy for patients with definite bicipital groove tenderness and \nbiceps tenodesis for patients, especially male patients, with bicipital groove \ntenderness who want to preserve supination strength.",

This study evaluates the effects of a perioperative \ncorticosteroid regimen on IL-6 formation, thrombogenesis, fibrinolysis, and \nclinical outcomes in patients undergoing unilateral, uncemented, total hip \narthroplasty.\nMETHODS: Twenty-seven patients (14 placebo and 13 study) were enrolled in this \nrandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The primary outcome was IL-6 \nlevels. The study group received 20 mg of prednisone orally followed by 2 doses \nof intravenous hydrocortisone, each 8 hours apart. Blood was drawn at several \ntime points for IL-6, prothrombin fragment 1.2, and plasmin-alpha-2-antiplasmin \ncomplex, a marker of fibrinolysis. In-hospital visual analog pain (visual analog \nscale) scores, patient-controlled analgesia use, and ability to climb stairs \nwere recorded.\nRESULTS: Mean serum IL-6 levels at 6 and 24 hours postoperatively were \nsignificantly lower for the study group, whereas serum prothrombin fragment 1.2 \nand plasmin-alpha-2-antiplasmin were not statistically different at any study \ntime point. Average pain scores were similar (P > .05), patient-controlled \nanalgesia use was lower in the study group (P = .02). At 3 months, 4 patients \nin the placebo and 1 patient in the study group had difficulty going up and \ndown staircases (P = .08).\nCONCLUSION: Corticosteroids were not more effective than placebo on \nthrombogenic markers in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty.",

In \naddition, the change in knee society score at 12 weeks postoperatively was \ncompared between the groups.\nRESULTS: There were no significant difference in demographic factors, wound \ncomplications, knee scores at 12 weeks and infection rate 24 months after \nsurgery in either group. Average blood loss was 1856ml and 1533ml for the drain \nand no drain groups, respectively (P value=0.0470). The need for transfusion was \n0.37 unit/patient for the drain group compared to 0.15 unit/patient for the no-drain group (P value=0.0432).\nCONCLUSION: Suction drains were not more effective than no drains in reducing total blood loss in patients undergoing revision knee arthroplasty.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether there are middle-term differences in knee function and pain in patients undergoing fixed- and mobile-bearing total knee arthroplasty (TKA).\n\nMethods: Eligible patients were randomized into two groups: the first group received TKA implantation with a fixed tibial platform (group A); the second group received TKA with a mobile tibial platform (group B). Patients were followed up (2 years), and their symptoms and limitations in daily living activities were evaluated using the Knee Outcome Survey-Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADLS), in addition to pain evaluation assessed using the pain visual analogue scale (VAS).\n\nResults: There were no significant differences in function and symptoms in the ADLS and VAS between the study groups.\n\nConclusion: The type of platform used in TKA (fixed vs. mobile) does not change the symptoms, function or pain of patients 2 years post-surgery. Although mobile TKAs may have better short-term results, at medium- and long-term follow-up they do not present important clinical differences compared with fixed-platform TKAs. This information is important so that surgeons can choose the most suitable implant for each patient.",

Patients were followed up (2 years), and their symptoms and limitations in daily living activities were evaluated using the Knee Outcome Survey-Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADLS), in addition to pain evaluation assessed using the pain visual analogue scale (VAS).\n\nResults: There were no significant differences in function and symptoms in the ADLS and VAS between the study groups.\n\nConclusion: Mobile-bearing TKA was not more effective than fixed-bearing TKA in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.",

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination of intravenous (IV) and topical tranexamic acid (TXA) in revision THA.\n\nMethods: Eighty-four consecutive patients undergoing revision THA were randomized into combined group and IV-TXA group. Patients in the combined group were given intravenously 15 mg/kg TXA as a preoperative, and topical TXA solution was applied at a concentration of 3 g TXA per 100-mL saline during the different procedure points. Patients in the IV-TXA group were given intravenously 15 mg/kg TXA alone.\n\nResults: The mean total blood loss, drainage volume, and maximum hemoglobin drop were significantly lower in the combined group than the IV-TXA group (P < .001, P < .001, P < .001, respectively). Compared with the IV-TXA group, the amount of blood transfusions and number of blood transfusions required were decreased dramatically in the combined group (P = .027, P < .001, respectively). One deep vein thrombosis and 4 calf muscular vein thrombosis in the combined group and 3 calf muscular vein thrombosis in the IV-TXA were detected by the Doppler ultrasound. No pulmonary embolism was observed and no significant differences were found in other complications between the 2 groups.\n\nConclusion: This study showed that combined administration of IV and topical TXA in revision THA can effectively decrease total blood loss and number of blood transfusions required without increasing the risk of deep vein thrombosis or/and pulmonary embolism compared with IV-TXA alone.",

Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 1.5, \n3, 6, and 12 months after ACI and was evaluated by the magnetic resonance \nobservation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score and the Knee injury and \nOsteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS).\nRESULTS: MOCART scores showed improvements after 3 months, with slight dose \ndependence, and further improvement after 12 months, although without \nsignificant dose dependence. The mean MOCART scores after 3 months (0 = worst, \n100 = best) were 59.8, 64.5, and 64.7 for the low-, medium-, and high-dose \ngroups, respectively, and 62.9 for all patients; at 12 months, these were 74.1, \n74.5, and 68.8 for the respective dose groups and 72.4 for all patients.

However, a correlation with clinical outcomes or the failure \nrate at 1 year after ACI was not found. A longer follow-up will be required for \nmore definite conclusions on the clinical relevance of ACI cell density to be \ndrawn.\nREGISTRATION: NCT01225575 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier); 2009-016816-20 \n(EudraCT number).",

        "abstract": "Background: Tenotomy and tenodesis are common treatments for lesions in the long head of biceps tendon (LHBT); however, which treatment is superior is still controversial. This study compared the outcomes of tenotomy with outcomes of tenodesis for treatment of LHBT lesions with rotator cuff tears.\n\nMethods: The study enrolled 128 patients with LHBT lesions and small- to medium-sized rotator cuff tear. Arthroscopic LHBT tenotomy was done in 56 patients (group I), and LHBT tenodesis was done for 72 patients (group II) with rotator cuff repair. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Score, simple shoulder test, pain visual analog scale, range of motion, and cosmetic changes were assessed initially, at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively, and the last visit. The elbow motor power and magnetic resonance imaging were evaluated at 12 months.\n\nResults: Both groups showed improvement in functional scores after treatments, but no significant difference was found between the 2 groups at each assessment. The rate of Popeye deformity was 3 times higher in group I (P = .04). Group II showed greater forearm supination power than group I (P = .02). On magnetic resonance imaging, 45 patients (80.4%) in group I showed maintenance of the LHBT cut end within the bicipital groove, whereas 65 patients (90.3%) in group II showed maintenance of fixated LHBT.\n\nConclusion: For the treatment of LHBT lesions with rotator cuff tear, patients with tenotomy and tenodesis both showed significant improvements in functional scores. The incidence of Popeye deformity was about 3-times higher in tenotomy group. No significant differences in elbow motor power were observed except greater forearm supination power in the tenodesis group.",

        "abstract": "Background: Tenotomy and tenodesis are common treatments for lesions in the long head of biceps tendon (LHBT); however, which treatment is superior is still controversial. This study compared the outcomes of tenotomy with outcomes of tenodesis for treatment of LHBT lesions with rotator cuff tears.\n\nMethods: The study enrolled 128 patients with LHBT lesions and small- to medium-sized rotator cuff tear. Arthroscopic LHBT tenotomy was done in 56 patients (group I), and LHBT tenodesis was done for 72 patients (group II) with rotator cuff repair. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Score, simple shoulder test, pain visual analog scale, range of motion, cosmetic changes, elbow motor power, and magnetic resonance imaging were assessed initially, at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively, and the last visit.\n\nResults: No significant difference was found between the 2 groups in functional scores at each assessment. The rate of Popeye deformity was 3 times higher in group I (P = .04). Group II showed greater forearm supination power than group I (P = .02). On magnetic resonance imaging, 45 patients (80.4%) in group I showed maintenance of the LHBT cut end within the bicipital groove, whereas 65 patients (90.3%) in group II showed maintenance of fixated LHBT.\n\nConclusion: Tenotomy was not more effective than tenodesis in patients with LHBT lesions and rotator cuff tears.",

        "abstract": "Background: Opioid analgesics have been a standard modality for postoperative pain management after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) but are also associated with increased risk of nausea, pruritus, vomiting, respiratory depression, prolonged ileus, and cognitive dysfunction. There is still a need for a method of anesthesia that can deliver effective long-term postoperative pain relief without incurring the high cost and health burden of opioids and nerve blocks.\n\nQuestions/purposes: (1) Is liposomal bupivacaine-based periarticular injection (PAI) more effective than morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA? (2) Do patients treated with liposomal bupivacaine-based PAI experience fewer opioid-related adverse events compared with patients treated with morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA?\n\nMethods: This multicenter, blind trial randomized 119 patients undergoing TKA with spinal anesthesia to receive spinal anesthesia plus periarticular injection with liposomal bupivacaine (40 patients), spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine plus intrathecal morphine (41 patients) but no liposomal bupivacaine injection, or spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine (38 patients) and no liposomal bupivacaine injection. The two groups that did not receive periarticular liposomal bupivacaine did receive periarticular injection with ropivacaine, and all three groups had ketorolac (30 mg) plus epinephrine (1:1000) in the periarticular injections. Patients in all three groups received identical perioperative multimodal analgesic and antiemetic drugs. All patients were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized and no patients were lost to followup. The primary study endpoints were visual analog score (VAS) for pain and narcotic use during postoperative day 1. Secondary endpoints included side effects associated with narcotic administration during the hospital stay.\n\nResults: Mean VAS pain in the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group was lower than that for the ropivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (1.8 \u00b1 2.1 versus 3.3 \u00b1 2.3, p = 0.005, mean difference: 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-2.5) and 12 hours (1.5 \u00b1 2.0 versus 3.3 \u00b1 2.4, p < 0.001, mean difference: 1.8, 95% CI, 0.8-2.8) after surgery. The morphine spinal group had lower pain compared with the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (0.9 \u00b1 1.8 versus 1.8 \u00b1 2.1, p = 0.035, mean difference: 1.0, 95% CI, 0.1-1.8), but there was no difference at 12 hours (0.8 \u00b1 1.5 versus 1.5 \u00b1 2.0, p = 0.086, mean difference: 0.7, 95% CI, -0.1 to 1.5). The magnitude of the differences at 6 and 12 hours are near the lower end of minimal clinically important differences reported in the literature, and thus the improvement shown in this study may only represent a small clinical improvement. Both the liposomal bupivacaine group (13% [five of 40]) and the ropivacaine group (5% [two of 38]) had fewer incidents of itching (pruritus) than the spinal morphine group (38% [15 of 41]) (p = 0.001).\n\nConclusions: Liposomal bupivacaine-based periarticular injection was not more effective than morphine-based spinal anesthesia on visual analog score for pain and narcotic use during postoperative day 1 in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.",

        "abstract": "Background: Opioid analgesics have been a standard modality for postoperative pain management after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) but are also associated with increased risk of nausea, pruritus, vomiting, respiratory depression, prolonged ileus, and cognitive dysfunction. There is still a need for a method of anesthesia that can deliver effective long-term postoperative pain relief without incurring the high cost and health burden of opioids and nerve blocks.\n\nQuestions/purposes: (1) Is liposomal bupivacaine-based periarticular injection (PAI) more effective than morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA? (2) Do patients treated with liposomal bupivacaine-based PAI experience fewer opioid-related adverse events compared with patients treated with morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA?\n\nMethods: This multicenter, blind trial randomized 119 patients undergoing TKA with spinal anesthesia to receive spinal anesthesia plus periarticular injection with liposomal bupivacaine (40 patients), spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine plus intrathecal morphine (41 patients) but no liposomal bupivacaine injection, or spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine (38 patients) and no liposomal bupivacaine injection. The two groups that did not receive periarticular liposomal bupivacaine did receive periarticular injection with ropivacaine, and all three groups had ketorolac (30 mg) plus epinephrine (1:1000) in the periarticular injections. Patients in all three groups received identical perioperative multimodal analgesic and antiemetic drugs. All patients were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized and no patients were lost to followup. The primary study endpoints were visual analog score (VAS) for pain and narcotic use during postoperative day 1. Secondary endpoints included side effects associated with narcotic administration during the hospital stay.\n\nResults: Mean VAS pain in the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group was lower than that for the ropivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (1.8 \u00b1 2.1 versus 3.3 \u00b1 2.3, p = 0.005, mean difference: 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-2.5) and 12 hours (1.5 \u00b1 2.0 versus 3.3 \u00b1 2.4, p < 0.001, mean difference: 1.8, 95% CI, 0.8-2.8) after surgery. The morphine spinal group had lower pain compared with the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (0.9 \u00b1 1.8 versus 1.8 \u00b1 2.1, p = 0.035, mean difference: 1.0, 95% CI, 0.1-1.8), but there was no difference at 12 hours (0.8 \u00b1 1.5 versus 1.5 \u00b1 2.0, p = 0.086, mean difference: 0.7, 95% CI, -0.1 to 1.5). The magnitude of the differences at 6 and 12 hours are near the lower end of minimal clinically important differences reported in the literature, and thus the improvement shown in this study may only represent a small clinical improvement. Both the liposomal bupivacaine group (13% [five of 40]) and the ropivacaine group (5% [two of 38]) had fewer incidents of itching (pruritus) than the spinal morphine group (38% [15 of 41]) (p = 0.001).\n\nConclusions: This prospective multicenter three-arm blind randomized controlled trial showed potentially improved pain control at 6 and 12 hours in the liposomal bupivacaine and intrathecal morphine groups compared with the ropivacaine group at the cost of much higher incidences of pruritus (itching) in the intrathecal morphine group. Based on these results, we prefer the use of PAI with liposomal bupivacaine as an alternative to spinal anesthesia with intrathecal morphine as a result of similar postoperative pain control and the potential for reducing adverse events.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Most studies on grafts for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) \nreconstruction (ACLR) have been of autografts or nonirradiated allografts with a \nsingle-bundle (SB) technique. Outcome reports evaluating anatomic double-bundle \n(DB) ACLR with a hamstring tendon autograft versus irradiated allograft are \nrare.\nPURPOSE: To compare the clinical outcomes of arthroscopic anatomic DB ACLR with \na hamstring tendon autograft versus irradiated allograft.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.\nMETHODS: Between 2008 and 2009, a total of 107 patients undergoing arthroscopic \nDB ACLR were prospectively randomized consecutively into 1 of 2 groups \n(autograft [Auto] group and irradiated allograft [Ir-Allo] group). All the \nsurgical procedures were performed by the same senior surgeon using the DB \nreconstruction technique. All irradiated hamstring tendon allografts were \nsterilized with 2.5 Mrad of irradiation before distribution and were obtained \nfrom a single certified tissue bank. Graft fixation on the femoral side was by \nan Endobutton, and on the tibial side by a bioabsorbable interference screw \naugmented with a staple. The same rehabilitation protocol was applied to all \npatients. Before surgery and at a mean of 6.9 years of follow-up, patients were \nevaluated by the same observer according to objective and subjective clinical \nevaluations including detailed history, physical examination, radiography, \nfunctional knee ligament testing, KT-2000 arthrometer testing, Harner vertical \njump and Daniel 1-legged hop tests, Lysholm score, Tegner score, International \nKnee Documentation Committee (IKDC) standard evaluation form, and Cincinnati \nknee score.\nRESULTS: A total of 83 patients (Auto: n = 40 [mean age, 29.2 \u00b1 6.9 years]; \nIr-Allo: n = 43 [mean age, 28.6 \u00b1 7.2 years]) fulfilled follow-up and clinical \nevaluations. No significant differences were found between the 2 groups \naccording to the overall IKDC functional and subjective evaluations as well as \ntesting of activity levels. Differences were found when comparing the results at \nfinal follow-up according to the Lachman test, anterior drawer test, pivot-shift \ntest, and KT-2000 arthrometer measurements (P < .001). 87.5% of patients in the \nAuto group and 34.9% in the Ir-Allo group had a side-to-side difference <3 mm. \nThe rate of laxity (side-to-side difference >5 mm) with an irradiated allograft \n(30.2%) was higher than that with an autograft (7.5%) (P < .001). The failure \nrate in the Ir-Allo group (30.2%) was higher than that in the Auto group (7.5%) \n(P < .001). Anterior and rotational stability decreased in the Ir-Allo group; \npatients in the Ir-Allo group also had a shorter operation time. There were \n10.0% (4/40) of patients in the Auto group and 32.6% (19/43) of patients in the \nIr-Allo group who had arthritic progression (P < .05).\nCONCLUSION: Hamstring tendon autograft was not more effective than irradiated \nallograft on overall IKDC functional and subjective evaluations in patients \nundergoing arthroscopic anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament \nreconstruction.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Most studies on grafts for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) \nreconstruction (ACLR) have been of autografts or nonirradiated allografts with a \nsingle-bundle (SB) technique. Outcome reports evaluating anatomic double-bundle \n(DB) ACLR with a hamstring tendon autograft versus irradiated allograft are \nrare.\nPURPOSE: To compare the clinical outcomes of arthroscopic anatomic DB ACLR with \na hamstring tendon autograft versus irradiated allograft.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.\nMETHODS: Between 2008 and 2009, a total of 107 patients undergoing arthroscopic \nDB ACLR were prospectively randomized consecutively into 1 of 2 groups \n(autograft [Auto] group and irradiated allograft [Ir-Allo] group). All the \nsurgical procedures were performed by the same senior surgeon using the DB \nreconstruction technique. All irradiated hamstring tendon allografts were \nsterilized with 2.5 Mrad of irradiation before distribution and were obtained \nfrom a single certified tissue bank. Graft fixation on the femoral side was by \nan Endobutton, and on the tibial side by a bioabsorbable interference screw \naugmented with a staple. The same rehabilitation protocol was applied to all \npatients. Before surgery and at a mean of 6.9 years of follow-up, patients were \nevaluated by the same observer according to objective and subjective clinical \nevaluations including detailed history, physical examination, radiography, \nfunctional knee ligament testing, KT-2000 arthrometer testing, Harner vertical \njump and Daniel 1-legged hop tests, Lysholm score, Tegner score, International \nKnee Documentation Committee (IKDC) standard evaluation form, and Cincinnati \nknee score.\nRESULTS: A total of 83 patients (Auto: n = 40 [mean age, 29.2 \u0412\u00b1 6.9 years]; \nIr-Allo: n = 43 [mean age, 28.6 \u0412\u00b1 7.2 years]) fulfilled follow-up and clinical \nevaluations. No significant differences were found between the 2 groups \naccording to the overall IKDC functional and subjective evaluations as well as \ntesting of activity levels. Significant between-group differences were found \nwhen comparing the results at final follow-up according to the Lachman test, \nanterior drawer test, pivot-shift test, and KT-2000 arthrometer measurements (P \n< .001). Most importantly, 87.5% of patients in the Auto group and 34.9% in the \nIr-Allo group had a side-to-side difference <3 mm. The rate of laxity \n(side-to-side difference >5 mm) with an irradiated allograft (30.2%) was higher \nthan that with an autograft (7.5%) (P < .001). The failure rate in the Ir-Allo \ngroup (30.2%) was higher than that in the Auto group (7.5%) (P < .001). Anterior \nand rotational stability decreased significantly in the Ir-Allo group; patients \nin the Ir-Allo group also had a shorter operation time. There were 10.0% (4/40) \nof patients in the Auto group and 32.6% (19/43) of patients in the Ir-Allo group \nwho had arthritic progression (P < .05).\nCONCLUSION: There were no significant differences in postoperative activity \nlevels and functional outcomes between the Auto and Ir-Allo groups. However, a \nsignificant increase in anterior and rotational laxity in the Ir-Allo group was \nfound according to evaluations. We do not advocate an irradiated hamstring \ntendon allograft for DB ACLR.",

So far, estimation by \neye and palpation is the standard procedure to intraoperatively assess the \ndistance of the cup to the anterior rim.

The primary outcome was the \nrisk for anterior protrusion of the cup above the acetabular rim and thus \npotential psoas impingement, defined as an overhang of the cup above the \nanterior acetabular rim as measured on postoperative CT, which was either \ncontrolled with the help of navigation or standard control by eye and palpation \nintraoperatively. Postoperatively, the anterior protrusion of the cup above the \nacetabular rim was measured on three-dimensional (3-D) CT by a blinded, external \ninstitute. In addition to patient-related outcome measures, the Harris hip \nscore, Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and EuroQol were \nobtained 1 year postoperatively.

Participants were randomly divided into three groups: EXER, exercise program; EXER + CBT, exercise program plus support group sessions for lifestyle modification, with a CBT; and CONTROL, routine treatment. The primary outcome was weight change. They were compared on weight, functional capacity, and cardiometabolic profile.\n\nResults: The weight change (Kg) was -7.4 (-9.6 to 5,1); -4,2 (-6,8 to -1.6) and 2.9 (0.4 to 5.3) and the BMI change (kg/m2) was -2.7 (-3.6 to -1.8); -1.4 (-2.4 to -0.4) and 1.1 (0.1 to 2.1) for groups EXER, EXER + CBT, and CONTROL, respectively. Changes were significant when compared to the control group (p < 0.001), but there were no differences between the two intervention arms (p = 0.2). Functional capacity and cardiometabolic parameters improved in the intervention arms and worsened in the control group. The adherence to the exercise program in both groups was above 78 %.\n\nConclusion: The exercise program was more effective than routine treatment on weight change in morbidly obese individuals awaiting bariatric surgery.",

Participants were randomly divided into three groups: EXER, exercise program; EXER + CBT, exercise program plus support group sessions for lifestyle modification, with a CBT; and CONTROL, routine treatment. They were compared on weight, functional capacity, and cardiometabolic profile.\n\nResults: The weight change (Kg) was -7.4 (-9.6 to 5,1); -4,2 (-6,8 to -1.6) and 2.9 (0.4 to 5.3) and the BMI change (kg/m2) was -2.7 (-3.6 to -1.8); -1.4 (-2.4 to -0.4) and 1.1 (0.1 to 2.1) for groups EXER, EXER + CBT, and CONTROL, respectively. Changes were significant when compared to the control group (p < 0.001), but there were no differences between the two intervention arms (p = 0.2). Functional capacity and cardiometabolic parameters significantly improved in the intervention arms and worsened in the control group. The adherence to the exercise program in both groups was above 78 %.\n\nConclusion: A 4-month, twice-weekly supervised program of low-intensity physical activity that encourages individuals to adopt a more active lifestyle can positively interfere with weight loss and improvement in functional capacity and cardiometabolic parameters of morbidly obese individuals with and without the aid of support group sessions.",

One group received preemptive intra-articular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection, and the second group received preemptive periacetabular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection. Before closure all patients received an additional dose of 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% intra-articularly. Data were compared with respect to postoperative pain with visual analog scale (VAS) and analgesic consumption, documented in a pain diary for 2 weeks after surgery.\n\nResults: Twenty-one patients were treated with intra-articular injection, and 21 patients with peri-acetabular injection. There were no significant differences with regards to patient demographics or surgical procedures. VAS scores recorded during the first 30 minutes postoperatively and 18 hours after surgery were significantly lower in the periacetabular group compared with in the intra-articular group (0.667 \u00b1 1.49 vs 2.11 \u00b1 2.29; P < .045 and 2.62 \u00b1 2.2 vs 4.79 \u00b1 2.6; P < .009). There were no differences between the groups with regard to analgesic consumption.\n\nConclusions: Periacetabular injection of bupivacaine 0.5% was superior to intra-articular injection in pain reduction after hip arthroscopy at 30 minutes and 18 hours postoperatively. However, total analgesic consumption over the first 2 postoperative weeks and VAS pain measurements were not significantly affected.",

We \ncarried out a prospective randomized study to compare two different bands.\nMETHODS: Between January 1, 2009 and January 31, 2010, 103 morbidly obese \npatients were randomized between SAGB and MiniMizer Extra adjustable gastric \nbands. The SAGB was used in 49 and MiniMizer Extra in 54 patients. Weight loss, \ncomorbidities, long-term complications, and quality of life were evaluated after \n5\u0412\u00a0years.\nRESULTS: Patient baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. The \nmean patient age was 45.9\u0412\u00a0\u0412\u00b1\u0412\u00a011.7\u0412\u00a0years, and mean preoperative BMI was \n47.5\u0412\u00a0\u0412\u00b1\u0412\u00a07.3\u0412\u00a0kg/m2. A total of 90 of 103 patients (87.3\u0412\u00a0%) completed the 5-year \nfollow-up. The mean excess weight loss was 44.1 and 50.3\u0412\u00a0% in SAGB and MiniMizer \ngroups, respectively (p\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a00.14). A proportion of patients who reached a \nBMI\u0412\u00a0<\u0412\u00a035\u0412\u00a0kg/m2 was significantly larger in MiniMizer Extra group (52.9 vs \n25.5\u0412\u00a0%; p\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a00.01). Complications developed in 15 patients (14.5\u0412\u00a0%) and consisted \nof 5 band erosions, 4 port-related complications, 3 band slippages, and 3 band \nintolerances. All five band erosions developed in MiniMizer Extra group, but the \ndifference was not significant (p\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a00.058). No difference was found regarding \npostoperative complications, resolution of comorbidities, and quality of life \nbetween compared groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: SAGB and MiniMizer Extra bands demonstrated similar long-term \nresults regarding the weight loss, resolution of comorbidities, morbidity, and \nquality of life.",

Compared with \nondansetron, ramosetron was associated with significantly lower incidence rates \nof nausea at: (1) 12-18\u0412\u00a0hours: 3/45 vs 11/45 (P\u0412\u00a0= .016), (2)\u0412\u00a018-24\u0412\u00a0hours: 1/45 \nvs 9/45 (P\u0412\u00a0= .005), and vomiting at 18-24\u0412\u00a0hours: 1/45 vs 6/45 (P\u0412\u00a0= .044). There \nwere no significant differences in the use of rescue-antiemetic medicine, pain \nscore, patient satisfaction, and ADRs.\nCONCLUSION: Preoperative ramosetron provided more prolonged PONV prophylaxis \nthan ondansetron after TKA in our setting, and had a similar ADR profile. Other \ntrials are needed to confirm our results before ramosetron is adopted widely.",

Exclusions were patients with multiple injuries, other conditions limiting mobility, and ankle injuries that required immobilisation and those unable to accommodate the time intensive study protocol.\n\nIntervention: Participants received either usual care, consisting of written instructions regarding protection, rest, cryotherapy, compression, elevation, and graduated weight bearing activities, or usual care enhanced with a supervised programme of physiotherapy.\n\nMain outcome measures: The primary outcome of efficacy was the proportion of participants reporting excellent recovery assessed with the foot and ankle outcome score (FAOS). Excellent recovery was defined as a score \u0456450/500 at three months. A difference of at least 15% increase in the absolute proportion of participants with excellent recovery was deemed clinically important. Secondary analyses included the assessment of excellent recovery at one and six months; change from baseline using continuous scores at one, three, and six months; and clinical and biomechanical measures of ankle function, assessed at one, three, and six months.\n\nResults: The absolute proportion of patients achieving excellent recovery at three months was not significantly different between the physiotherapy (98/229, 43%) and usual care (79/214, 37%) arms (absolute difference 6%, 95% confidence interval -3% to 15%). The observed trend towards benefit with physiotherapy did not increase in the per protocol analysis and was in the opposite direction by six months. These trends remained similar and were never statistically or clinically important when the FAOS was analysed as a continuous change score.\n\nConclusions: In a general population of patients seeking hospital based acute care for simple ankle sprains, there is no evidence to support a clinically important improvement in outcome with the addition of supervised physiotherapy to usual care, as provided in this protocol.",

Preoperative dose, an additional postoperative dose, and 2 postoperative additional doses of TA were infused intravenously in groups A (30 mg/kg), B (15 mg/kg), and C (10 mg/kg), respectively, and TA was not infused in group D. Blood loss (intraoperative, postoperative, and total blood loss), blood transfusion rate and volume, hemoglobin level, and incidence of deep vein thrombosis were analyzed.\n\nResults: The total blood loss and postoperative blood loss were significantly lower in groups B and C without any difference between them. As for intraoperative blood loss, there was no significant difference between groups A and B and between groups B and C with superior efficacy than group D.\n\nConclusion: With the same total dose of TA, the preoperative dose and an additional dose of TA were superior to a single preoperative dose of TA in reducing blood loss in TKA. Besides, 1 additional dose was comparable to 2 additional doses of TA in reducing blood loss.",

Preoperative dose, an additional postoperative dose, and 2 postoperative additional doses of TA were infused intravenously in groups A (30 mg/kg), B (15 mg/kg), and C (10 mg/kg), respectively, and TA was not infused in group D. Blood loss (intraoperative, postoperative, and total blood loss), blood transfusion rate and volume, hemoglobin level, and incidence of deep vein thrombosis were analyzed.\n\nResults: The total blood loss and postoperative blood loss were significantly lower in groups B and C compared to group D. There was no significant difference between groups B and C. For intraoperative blood loss, there was no significant difference between groups A and B and between groups B and C. Groups A, B, and C had lower intraoperative blood loss compared to group D.\n\nConclusion: The preoperative dose and an additional dose of TA was not more effective than 2 additional doses of TA in reducing blood loss in patients undergoing TKA.",

Included patients met the migraine criteria of the International Headache Society. Patients were randomized to intranasal lidocaine or saline solution; all participants received 10 mg of intravenous metoclopramide. Patient pain intensity was assessed with an 11-point numeric rating scale score. The primary outcome measure was the change in pain scores at 15 minutes; secondary outcomes were changes in pain intensity after pain onset and need for rescue medication.\n\nResults: Patients (n=162) were randomized into 2 groups with similar baseline migraine characteristics and numeric rating scale scores. The median reduction in numeric rating scale score at 15 minutes was 3 (interquartile range [IQR] 2 to 5) for the lidocaine group and 2 (IQR 1 to 4) for the saline solution group (median difference=1.0; 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 2.1). The reduction in pain score at 30 minutes was 4 (IQR 3 to 7) for the lidocaine group and 5 (IQR 2 to 7) for the saline solution group (median difference=1.0; 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 2.1). Need for rescue medication did not differ between the groups, and local irritation was the most common adverse event in the lidocaine group.\n\nConclusion: Although intranasal lidocaine was found no more efficacious than normal saline solution in our study, future studies should focus on patients who present earlier after headache onset.",

        "abstract": "AIMS: To investigate the metabolic effects of 12-week oral supplementation with \nLactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 in patients with type 2 diabetes on insulin \ntherapy.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: In a double-blind trial, we randomized 46 people with \ntype 2 diabetes to placebo or a low (108 \u0432\u0402\u2030CFU/d) or high dose (1010 \u0432\u0402\u2030CFU/d) of \nL. reuteri DSM 17938 for 12\u0432\u0402\u2030weeks. The primary endpoint was the effect of \nsupplementation on glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). Secondary endpoints were \ninsulin sensitivity (assessed by glucose clamp), liver fat content, body \ncomposition, body fat distribution, faecal microbiota composition and serum bile \nacids.\nRESULTS: Supplementation with L. reuteri DSM 17938 for 12\u0432\u0402\u2030weeks did not affect \nHbA1c, liver steatosis, adiposity or microbiota composition. Participants who \nreceived the highest dose of L. reuteri exhibited increases in insulin \nsensitivity index (ISI) and serum levels of the secondary bile acid deoxycholic \nacid (DCA) compared with baseline, but these differences were not significant in \nthe between-group analyses. Post hoc analysis showed that participants who \nresponded with increased ISI after L. reuteri supplementation had higher \nmicrobial diversity at baseline, and increased serum levels of DCA after \nsupplementation. In addition, increases in DCA levels correlated with \nimprovement in insulin sensitivity in the probiotic recipients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Intake of L. reuteri DSM 17938 for 12\u0432\u0402\u2030weeks did not affect HbA1c in \npeople with type 2 diabetes on insulin therapy; however, L. reuteri improved \ninsulin sensitivity in a subset of participants and we propose that high \ndiversity of the gut microbiota at baseline may be important.",

There was a significant reduction in length of stay for those that received TXA 3.58 days (0.84) compared with the control group 4.27 days (0.98) (P < .001). There was significantly less intraoperative blood loss observed in the TXA group (0.460L SD 0.228) compared with the control group (0.687L SD 0.283L) (P < .001). The estimated blood loss was also significantly less in the TXA group (1.084L SD 0.440) compared with the control group (1.394 L SD 0.426).\n\nConclusion: TXA is an effective agent in reducing blood loss in total hip arthroplasty using the anterior approach.

There are few studies \nthat provide evidence that this remains true in the long term.\nPURPOSE: To compare the long-term results of patellar instability after TTT with \nand without MPFL reconstruction in 2 randomized groups.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\nMETHODS: A total of 34 patients (36 knees) were randomized to 2 groups. The \nfirst group underwent lateral release (LR) and TTT for confirmed maltracking of \nthe patella (control group). The second group underwent MPFL reconstruction in \naddition to TTT and LR (reconstruction group). The primary outcomes were \nvalidated questionnaires (Kujala score, Tegner activity score) and a visual \nanalog scale (VAS) assessing their insecurity. Secondary outcomes included \nclinical assessment, redislocation rates, reoperation rates, time to return to \nactivities, patient satisfaction, and quantitative computed tomography (CT) at 1 \nyear. Patients were followed up at a minimum of 5 years postoperatively. Two \npatients in the control group and 1 patient in the reconstruction group were \nlost to follow-up at 5 years.\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences in the Kujala (P = .75), Tegner \n(P = .36), or VAS (P = .75) scores at any time period. One patient in the \ncontrol group sustained a patellar redislocation at 3 years. Five patients in \nthe control group and 2 in the reconstruction group had functional failures and \nrequired reoperations; however, this was not statistically significant (P = \n.30). There were no significant differences between groups in the time to return \nto school or work (P = .65) or sports (P = .38) after surgery. Patient \nsatisfaction was higher in the reconstruction group compared with the control \ngroup (P = .04), and quantitative CT scans showed that the reconstruction group \nhad improvement in the mean patellar tilt (6\u00b0 vs -8\u00b0, respectively; P = .03) and \nmean congruence angle (13\u00b0 vs -11\u00b0, respectively; P = .03) in the \nquadriceps-contracted state compared with the control group.\nCONCLUSION: TTT with MPFL reconstruction was not more effective than TTT alone \non the primary functional outcomes (Kujala score, Tegner activity score, VAS) in \npatients with patellar instability.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tibial tubercle transfer (TTT) and medial patellofemoral ligament \n(MPFL) reconstruction have both shown, either in isolation or in combination, to \nprovide improved patellofemoral joint (PFJ) stability. There are few studies \nthat provide evidence that this remains true in the long term.\nPURPOSE: To compare the long-term results of patellar instability after TTT with \nand without MPFL reconstruction in 2 randomized groups.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\nMETHODS: A total of 34 patients (36 knees) were randomized to 2 groups. The \nfirst group underwent lateral release (LR) and TTT for confirmed maltracking of \nthe patella (control group). The second group underwent MPFL reconstruction in \naddition to TTT and LR (reconstruction group). Patients were followed up with \nvalidated questionnaires (Kujala score, Tegner activity score), a visual analog \nscale (VAS) assessing their insecurity, and a clinical assessment at a minimum \nof 5 years postoperatively. Participants also underwent quantitative computed \ntomography (CT) at 1 year for comparison. Two patients in the control group and \n1 patient in the reconstruction group were lost to follow-up at 5 years.\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences in the Kujala ( P = .75), Tegner \n( P = .36), or VAS ( P = .75) scores at any time period. One patient in the \ncontrol group sustained a patellar redislocation at 3 years. Five patients in \nthe control group and 2 in the reconstruction group had functional failures and \nrequired reoperations; however, this was not statistically significant ( P = \n.30). There were no significant differences between groups in the time to return \nto school or work ( P = .65) or sports ( P = .38) after surgery. Overall patient \nsatisfaction was higher in the reconstruction group compared with the control \ngroup ( P = .04), and quantitative CT scans showed that the reconstruction group \nhad a statistically significant improvement in the mean patellar tilt (6\u0412\u00b0 vs \n-8\u0412\u00b0, respectively; P = .03) and mean congruence angle (13\u0412\u00b0 vs -11\u0412\u00b0, \nrespectively; P = .03) in the quadriceps-contracted state compared with the \ncontrol group.\nCONCLUSION: Reconstruction of the MPFL in addition to TTT and LR resulted in \nimproved alignment parameters (congruence angle, patellar tilt angle) as well as \npatient satisfaction. The Kujala and Tegner scores were no different between the \n2 groups at any time period. There was insufficient evidence to conclude that \nthe addition of MPFL reconstruction to TTT results in fewer redislocations or \nreoperations. This study concludes that MPFL reconstruction improves PFJ \nalignment and patient satisfaction; however, further studies with larger patient \nnumbers are required to satisfy its significance with respect to redislocation \nrates and functional scores in the long term.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bronchiolitis is the most common lung infection in infants and \ntreatment focuses on management of respiratory distress and hypoxia. High-flow \nwarm humidified oxygen (HFWHO) is increasingly used, but has not been rigorously \nstudied in randomised trials. We aimed to examine whether HFWHO provided \nenhanced respiratory support, thereby shortening time to weaning off oxygen.\nMETHODS: In this open, phase 4, randomised controlled trial, we recruited \nchildren aged less than 24 months with moderate bronchiolitis attending the \nemergency department of the John Hunter Hospital or the medical unit of the John \nHunter Children's Hospital in New South Wales, Australia. Patients were randomly \nallocated (1:1) via opaque sealed envelopes to HFWHO (maximum flow of 1 L/kg per \nmin to a limit of 20 L/min using 1:1 air-oxygen ratio, resulting in a maximum \nFiO2 of 0\u0412\u00b76) or standard therapy (cold wall oxygen 100% via infant nasal \ncannulae at low flow to a maximum of 2 L/min) using a block size of four and \nstratifying for gestational age at birth. The primary outcome was time from \nrandomisation to last use of oxygen therapy. All randomised children were \nincluded in the primary and secondary safety analyses. This trial is registered \nwith the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number \nACTRN12612000685819.\nFINDINGS: From July 16, 2012, to May 1, 2015, we randomly assigned 202 children \nto either HFWHO (101 children) or standard therapy (101 children). Median time \nto weaning was 24 h (95% CI 18-28) for standard therapy and 20 h (95% CI 17-34) \nfor HFWHO (hazard ratio [HR] for difference in survival distributions 0\u0412\u00b79 [95% \nCI 0\u0412\u00b77-1\u0412\u00b72]; log rank p=0\u0412\u00b761). Fewer children experienced treatment failure on \nHFWHO (14 [14%]) compared with standard therapy (33 [33%]; p=0\u0412\u00b70016); of these \nchildren, those on HFWHO were supported for longer than were those on standard \ntherapy before treatment failure (HR 0\u0412\u00b73; 95% CI 0\u0412\u00b72-0\u0412\u00b76; p<0\u0412\u00b70001). 20 (61%) of \n33 children who experienced treatment failure on standard therapy were rescued \nwith HFWHO. 12 (12%) of children on standard therapy required transfer to the \nintensive care unit compared with 14 (14%) of those on HFWHO (difference -1%; \n95% CI -7 to 16; p=0\u0412\u00b741). Four adverse events occurred (oxygen desaturation and \ncondensation inhalation in the HFWHO group, and two incidences of oxygen tubing \ndisconnection in the standard therapy group); none resulted in withdrawal from \nthe trial. No oxygen-related serious adverse events occurred. Secondary \neffectiveness outcomes are reported in the Results section.\nINTERPRETATION: HFWHO did not significantly reduce time on oxygen compared with \nstandard therapy, suggesting that early use of HFWHO does not modify the \nunderlying disease process in moderately severe bronchiolitis. HFWHO might have \na role as a rescue therapy to reduce the proportion of children requiring \nhigh-cost intensive care.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bronchiolitis is the most common lung infection in infants and \ntreatment focuses on management of respiratory distress and hypoxia. High-flow \nwarm humidified oxygen (HFWHO) is increasingly used, but has not been rigorously \nstudied in randomised trials. We aimed to examine whether HFWHO provided \nenhanced respiratory support, thereby shortening time to weaning off oxygen.\nMETHODS: In this open, phase 4, randomised controlled trial, we recruited \nchildren aged less than 24 months with moderate bronchiolitis attending the \nemergency department of the John Hunter Hospital or the medical unit of the John \nHunter Children's Hospital in New South Wales, Australia. Patients were randomly \nallocated (1:1) via opaque sealed envelopes to HFWHO (maximum flow of 1 L/kg per \nmin to a limit of 20 L/min using 1:1 air-oxygen ratio, resulting in a maximum \nFiO2 of 0\u00b76) or standard therapy (cold wall oxygen 100% via infant nasal \ncannulae at low flow to a maximum of 2 L/min) using a block size of four and \nstratifying for gestational age at birth. The primary outcome was time from \nrandomisation to last use of oxygen therapy. Secondary outcomes included treatment \nfailure, time to treatment failure, intensive care unit transfer, and adverse \nevents. All randomised children were included in the primary and secondary safety \nanalyses. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical \nTrials Registry, number ACTRN12612000685819.\nFINDINGS: From July 16, 2012, to May 1, 2015, we randomly assigned 202 children \nto either HFWHO (101 children) or standard therapy (101 children). Median time \nto weaning was 24 h (95% CI 18-28) for standard therapy and 20 h (95% CI 17-34) \nfor HFWHO (hazard ratio [HR] for difference in survival distributions 0\u00b79 [95% \nCI 0\u00b77-1\u00b72]; log rank p=0\u00b761). Treatment failure occurred in 14 (14%) children \non HFWHO compared with 33 (33%) children on standard therapy (p=0\u00b70016). 12 (12%) \nof children on standard therapy required transfer to the intensive care unit \ncompared with 14 (14%) of those on HFWHO (difference -1%; 95% CI -7 to 16; \np=0\u00b741). Four adverse events occurred (oxygen desaturation and condensation \ninhalation in the HFWHO group, and two incidences of oxygen tubing disconnection \nin the standard therapy group); none resulted in withdrawal from the trial. No \noxygen-related serious adverse events occurred.\nINTERPRETATION: HFWHO was not more effective than standard therapy on time to \nweaning off oxygen in children with moderate bronchiolitis.",

There was no \ndifference in baseline characteristics between the groups: 30-day mortality \n(Intervention 9/18, 50% vs. Control 6/15, 40%; P=0.73), CPC 1/2 (Intervention: \n9/18, 50% vs. Control 7/14, 50%; P>0.99) or MACCE (Intervention: 9/18, 50% vs. \nControl 6/15, 40%; P=0.73).\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings support the feasibility and acceptability of \nconducting a large-scale randomised controlled trial of expedited transfer to \nCAC following OHCA to address a remaining uncertainty in post-arrest care.",

There were no significant differences in other variables, although glycated haemoglobin levels, diastolic blood pressure and fasting non-esterified fatty acid levels improved significantly in the PP but not in the AP group. Insulin sensitivity (M-value), C-reactive protein and fasting glucose improved significantly in the AP but not in the PP group. Total and LDL cholesterol levels and systolic blood pressure decreased significantly in both groups, and the urinary albumin excretion rate decreased from baseline in participants with microalbuminuria.\n\nConclusions: Isocaloric diets high in AP or PP allow similar improvements in metabolism and cardiovascular risk factors in people with T2DM, indicating that the differences in amino acid composition do not affect the metabolic responses to the interventions.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Measured resection (MR) and gap balancing (GB) are common surgical \ntechniques for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Controversy has arisen as each \nconceptually differs in how the knee is balanced through bone and soft tissue \nmanagement. The objective of the present study was to compare both the frequency \nof condylar liftoff and the location of femorotibial contact from extension \nthrough midflexion between patients undergoing GB or MR TKA.\nMETHODS: A total of 24 knees (23 patients) were randomly assigned at referral to \neither a surgeon performing MR or GB TKA with the same single radius, \nposterior-stabilized implant (12 per cohort). At 1-year postoperation, patients \nunderwent biplanar radiographic imaging at 0\u0412\u00b0, 20\u0412\u00b0, 40\u0412\u00b0, and 60\u0412\u00b0 of flexion. \nCondylar liftoff, contact location, and magnitude of excursion on each condyle \nwere measured. Preoperative and postoperative clinical outcome scores were also \ncollected.\nRESULTS: There was no difference (P\u0412\u00a0= .41) in the frequency of liftoff between \ncohorts. The MR cohort had more posterior contact on the medial condyle (P < \n.01) and more anterior contact on the lateral condyle (P < .01) throughout \nflexion. Motion patterns were similar between cohorts, with similar medial (P\u0412\u00a0= \n.48) and lateral (P\u0412\u00a0= .44) excursion, which was equal in magnitude between \ncondyles for both MR (P\u0412\u00a0= .48) and GB (P\u0412\u00a0= .73). There was no difference in \nclinical outcome scores between groups.\nCONCLUSION: For this particular implant system, GB and MR appear to produce \nsimilar kinematic and patient-reported outcome results.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Measured resection (MR) and gap balancing (GB) are common surgical \ntechniques for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Controversy has arisen as each \nconceptually differs in how the knee is balanced through bone and soft tissue \nmanagement. The objective of the present study was to compare both the frequency \nof condylar liftoff and the location of femorotibial contact from extension \nthrough midflexion between patients undergoing GB or MR TKA.\nMETHODS: A total of 24 knees (23 patients) were randomly assigned at referral to \neither a surgeon performing MR or GB TKA with the same single radius, \nposterior-stabilized implant (12 per cohort). At 1-year postoperation, patients \nunderwent biplanar radiographic imaging at 0\u00b0, 20\u00b0, 40\u00b0, and 60\u00b0 of flexion. \nCondylar liftoff, contact location, and magnitude of excursion on each condyle \nwere measured. Preoperative and postoperative clinical outcome scores were also \ncollected.\nRESULTS: There was no difference (P = .41) in the frequency of liftoff between \ncohorts. The MR cohort had more posterior contact on the medial condyle (P < \n.01) and more anterior contact on the lateral condyle (P < .01) throughout \nflexion. Motion patterns were similar between cohorts, with similar medial (P = \n.48) and lateral (P = .44) excursion, which was equal in magnitude between \ncondyles for both MR (P = .48) and GB (P = .73). There was no difference in \nclinical outcome scores between groups.\nCONCLUSION: Gap balancing was not more effective than measured resection in \npatients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The quality of cartilage repair after marrow stimulation is \nunpredictable. To overcome the shortcomings of the microfracture technique, \nvarious augmentation techniques have been developed. However, their efficacies \nremain unclear.\nHYPOTHESIS: The quality of cartilage repair and clinical outcomes would be \nsuperior in patients undergoing high tibial osteotomy (HTO) with microfracture \nand collagen augmentation compared to those undergoing HTO with microfracture \nalone without collagen augmentation for the treatment of medial compartment \nosteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.\nMETHODS: Twenty-eight patients undergoing HTO were randomized into 2 groups: \nmicrofracture alone (group 1, n = 14) or microfracture with collagen \naugmentation (group 2, n = 14). At 1 year postoperatively, second-look \narthroscopic surgery and biopsy of repaired cartilage were performed at the time \nof HTO plate removal. Biopsy specimens were graded using the International \nCartilage Repair Society Visual Assessment Scale II (ICRS II). In addition, \nimaging outcomes in terms of the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage \nrepair tissue (MOCART) score were assessed based on magnetic resonance imaging \n(MRI). Finally, clinical outcomes in terms of the visual analog scale (VAS) for \npain score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International \nKnee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and Tegner activity scale score were \nevaluated.\nRESULTS: The mean ICRS II score in group 2 was significantly higher than that in \ngroup 1 (1053.2 vs 885.4, respectively; P = .002). Group 2 showed greater \nimprovement in tissue morphology, cell morphology, surface architecture, \nmiddle/deep zone assessment, and overall assessment compared with group 1 ( P < \n.050 for all comparisons). Imaging outcomes based on the MOCART score were \nsuperior in group 2 compared to those in group 1 on MRI at 1 year \npostoperatively (64.6 vs 45.4, respectively; P = .001). The degree of defect \nrepair was better in group 2 than in group 1 ( P = .040). Clinical outcomes in \nterms of the VAS for pain score, KOOS, IKDC score, and Tegner activity scale \nscore were improved in both groups without between-group differences ( P > .100 \nfor all comparisons).\nCONCLUSION: The quality of cartilage repair after microfracture with collagen \naugmentation was superior to that after microfracture alone in patients \nundergoing HTO. Clinical results after 1 year did not reflect this difference in \ntissue repair. Therefore, a longer follow-up of the cohort is needed to answer \nthis question.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The quality of cartilage repair after marrow stimulation is \nunpredictable. To overcome the shortcomings of the microfracture technique, \nvarious augmentation techniques have been developed. However, their efficacies \nremain unclear.\nHYPOTHESIS: The quality of cartilage repair and clinical outcomes would be \nsuperior in patients undergoing high tibial osteotomy (HTO) with microfracture \nand collagen augmentation compared to those undergoing HTO with microfracture \nalone without collagen augmentation for the treatment of medial compartment \nosteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.\nMETHODS: Twenty-eight patients undergoing HTO were randomized into 2 groups: \nmicrofracture alone (group 1, n = 14) or microfracture with collagen \naugmentation (group 2, n = 14). At 1 year postoperatively, second-look \narthroscopic surgery and biopsy of repaired cartilage were performed at the time \nof HTO plate removal. Biopsy specimens were graded using the International \nCartilage Repair Society Visual Assessment Scale II (ICRS II). In addition, \nimaging outcomes in terms of the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage \nrepair tissue (MOCART) score were assessed based on magnetic resonance imaging \n(MRI). Clinical outcomes in terms of the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain \nscore, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International Knee \nDocumentation Committee (IKDC) score, and Tegner activity scale score were \nevaluated.\nRESULTS: The mean ICRS II score in group 2 was significantly higher than that in \ngroup 1 (1053.2 vs 885.4, respectively; P = .002). Group 2 showed greater \nimprovement in tissue morphology, cell morphology, surface architecture, \nmiddle/deep zone assessment, and overall assessment compared with group 1 ( P < \n.050 for all comparisons). Imaging outcomes based on the MOCART score were \nsuperior in group 2 compared to those in group 1 on MRI at 1 year \npostoperatively (64.6 vs 45.4, respectively; P = .001). The degree of defect \nrepair was better in group 2 than in group 1 ( P = .040). Clinical outcomes in \nterms of the VAS for pain score, KOOS, IKDC score, and Tegner activity scale \nscore showed no significant between-group differences ( P > .100 for all \ncomparisons).\nCONCLUSION: Microfracture with collagen augmentation was not more effective on \nclinical outcomes than microfracture alone in patients undergoing HTO for medial \ncompartment osteoarthritis of the knee.",

        "abstract": "Background: The use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) has demonstrated mixed clinical outcomes in randomized controlled trials when compared with hyaluronic acid (HA), an accepted nonsurgical treatment for symptomatic OA. Biological analysis of PRP has demonstrated an anti-inflammatory effect on the intra-articular environment.\n\nPurpose: To compare the clinical and biological effects of an intra-articular injection of PRP with those of an intra-articular injection of HA in patients with mild to moderate knee OA.\n\nStudy design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\n\nMethods: A total of 111 patients with symptomatic unilateral knee OA received a series of either leukocyte-poor PRP or HA injections under ultrasound guidance. Clinical data were collected before treatment and at 4 time points across a 1-year period. Synovial fluid was also collected for analysis of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers before treatment and at 12 and 24 weeks after treatment. Several measures were used to assess results: (1) Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale; (2) International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee evaluation, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, and Lysholm knee score; and (3) difference in intra-articular biochemical marker concentrations.\n\nResults: There were 49 patients randomized to treatment with PRP and 50 randomized to treatment with HA. No difference was seen between the groups in the primary outcome measure (WOMAC pain score). In the secondary outcome measure, linear contrasts identified a significantly higher IKDC score in the PRP group compared with the HA group at 24 weeks (mean \u00b1 standard error [SE], 65.5 \u00b1 3.6 vs 55.8 \u00b1 3.8, respectively; P = .013) and at final follow-up (52 weeks) (57.6 \u00b1 3.37 vs 46.6 \u00b1 3.76, respectively; P = .003). Linear contrasts also identified a statistically lower VAS score in the PRP group versus the HA group at 24 weeks (mean \u00b1 SE, 34.6 \u00b1 3.24 vs 48.6 \u00b1 3.7, respectively; P = .0096) and 52 weeks (44 \u00b1 4.6 vs 57.3 \u00b1 3.8, respectively; P = .0039). An examination of fixed effects showed that patients with mild OA and a lower body mass index had a statistically significant improvement in outcomes. In the biochemical analysis, differences between groups approached significance for interleukin-1_ (mean \u00b1 SE, 0.14 \u00b1 0.05 pg/mL [PRP] vs 0.34 \u00b1 0.16 pg/mL [HA]; P = .06) and tumor necrosis factor _ (0.08 \u00b1 0.01 pg/mL [PRP] vs 0.2 \u00b1 0.18 pg/mL [HA]; P = .068) at 12-week follow-up.\n\nConclusion: We found no difference between HA and PRP at any time point in the primary outcome measure: the patient-reported WOMAC pain score. Significant improvements were seen in other patient-reported outcome measures, with results favoring PRP over HA. Preceding a significant difference in subjective outcomes favoring PRP, there was a trend toward a decrease in 2 proinflammatory cytokines, which suggest that the anti-inflammatory properties of PRP may contribute to an improvement of symptoms.",

A total of 101 patients received arthroscopic \nrelease (n\u0412\u00a0= 50) or US-guided PRP injections (n\u0412\u00a0= 51). Outcomes were assessed \nusing a visual analog scale for pain, the Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation \n(PRTEE), and a calibrated hand dynamometer for grip strength.\nRESULTS: Both patient groups experienced significant improvement in all \nmeasures. Between-group comparisons showed a significantly higher value in the \nPRP group only for grip strength at week 8 (P\u0412\u00a0= .0073); all other significant \ndifferences were in favor of arthroscopy: overall pain (P\u0412\u00a0= .0021), night pain \n(P\u0412\u00a0= .0013), and PRTEE score (P\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a0.0013) at week 104 and grip strength at weeks \n24, 52, and 104 (all P < .0001).

        "abstract": "Introduction: Bariatric surgery is the only treatment option that achieves sustained weight loss in obese patients and that also has positive effects on obesity-related comorbidities. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) seems to achieve equal weight loss as laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), but there is still much debate about the quality of life (QOL) after LSG, mainly concerning the association with gastroesophageal reflux. Our hypothesis is that QOL after LSG is comparable with QOL after LRYGB.\n\nMaterials and methods: Between February 2013 and February 2014, 150 patients were randomized to undergo either LSG or LRYGB in our clinic. Differences in QOL were compared between groups by using multiple QOL questionnaires at follow-up moments preoperatively and 2 and 12 months after surgery.\n\nResults: After 12 months of follow-up, 128 patients had returned the questionnaires. Most QOL questionnaires showed significant improvement in scores between the preoperative moment and after 12 months of follow-up. The Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Questionnaire (GerdQ) score deteriorated in the LSG group after 2 months, but recovered again after 12 months. After 2 months of follow-up, the mean GerdQ score was 6.95 \u00b1 2.14 in the LSG group versus 5.50 \u00b1 1.49 in the LRYGB group (p < 0.001). After 1 year, the mean GerdQ score was 6.63 \u00b1 2.26 in the LSG group and 5.60 \u00b1 1.07 in the LRYGB group (p = 0.001).\n\nConclusion: This randomized controlled trial shows that patients who underwent LSG have significantly higher GerdQ scores at both 2 and 12 months postoperatively than patients who underwent LRYGB, whereas overall QOL did not differ significantly.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Bariatric surgery is the only treatment option that achieves sustained weight loss in obese patients and that also has positive effects on obesity-related comorbidities. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) seems to achieve equal weight loss as laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), but there is still much debate about the quality of life (QOL) after LSG, mainly concerning the association with gastroesophageal reflux.\n\nMaterials and methods: Between February 2013 and February 2014, 150 patients were randomized to undergo either LSG or LRYGB in our clinic. The primary outcome was quality of life. Differences in QOL were compared between groups by using multiple QOL questionnaires at follow-up moments preoperatively and 2 and 12 months after surgery.\n\nResults: After 12 months of follow-up, 128 patients had returned the questionnaires. The Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Questionnaire (GerdQ) score deteriorated in the LSG group after 2 months, but recovered again after 12 months. After 2 months of follow-up, the mean GerdQ score was 6.95 \u00b1 2.14 in the LSG group versus 5.50 \u00b1 1.49 in the LRYGB group (p < 0.001). After 1 year, the mean GerdQ score was 6.63 \u00b1 2.26 in the LSG group and 5.60 \u00b1 1.07 in the LRYGB group (p = 0.001). Overall quality of life did not differ significantly between the two groups.\n\nConclusion: LSG was not more effective than LRYGB regarding overall quality of life in obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery.",

Liposomal bupivacaine (LB) is an extended-release delivery of a \nphospholipid bilayer encapsulating bupivacaine that can result in drug delivery \nup to 72 hours. Prior studies in lower extremity surgery demonstrated efficacy \nof LB in comparison to a single-shot peripheral nerve block; however, no study \nhas investigated LB in a total shoulder arthroplasty population. Therefore, this \nstudy compared LB vs. an indwelling interscalene nerve block (IINB).\nMETHODS: This is a prospective, randomized study of 83 consecutive shoulder \narthroplasty patients; 36 patients received LB and a \"bridge\" of 30 mL of 0.5% \nbupivacaine, and 47 patients received an IINB.

        "abstract": "Background: Although previous studies suggested that bariatric surgery is the most effective and sustainable treatment method for morbid obesity in long term, but without changing in lifestyle, maintaining optimal weight loss is almost impossible.\n\nMethods: Sixty morbid obese patients (BMI \u0456 35) were evaluated before and after 12 weeks of bariatric surgery in order to compare the impact of two different exercise programs on body composition and functional capacity outcomes. Participants were divided into three groups: aerobic (A), aerobic-strength (AS), and control (C) group. Aerobic capacity was assessed with 12-min walk-run test (12MWRT). One-repetition maximum (1RM) test was performed to evaluation upper limb muscle strength. Lower extremity functional capacity was assessed by sit-to-stand test.\n\nResults: Weight, percent body fat (PBF), and fat mass (FM) reduced greater in the trial groups in comparison to the C group (P < 0.05). In the AS group, the reduction of fat-free mass (FFM) was significantly lower than that in the other groups. Mean changes in 12MWRT increased significantly in the intervention groups. The mean change in the sit-to-stand scores was not statistically significant between the three groups. Comparing the intervention groups showed that mean changes in 1RM variables increased in AS group (P = 0.03).\n\nConclusions: The data suggests a positive effect of exercise on weight and PBF decrease after surgery, and it leads to significant improvement on aerobic capacity. Moreover, doing resisted exercise caused greater preserving of lean mass.",

        "abstract": "Background: Although previous studies suggested that bariatric surgery is the most effective and sustainable treatment method for morbid obesity in long term, but without changing in lifestyle, maintaining optimal weight loss is almost impossible.\n\nMethods: Sixty morbid obese patients (BMI \u0456 35) were evaluated before and after 12 weeks of bariatric surgery in order to compare the impact of two different exercise programs on body composition and functional capacity outcomes. Participants were divided into three groups: aerobic (A), aerobic-strength (AS), and control (C) group. The primary outcome was body composition. Secondary outcomes included functional capacity measures. Aerobic capacity was assessed with 12-min walk-run test (12MWRT). One-repetition maximum (1RM) test was performed to evaluation upper limb muscle strength. Lower extremity functional capacity was assessed by sit-to-stand test.\n\nResults: Weight, percent body fat (PBF), and fat mass (FM) reduced greater in the trial groups in comparison to the C group (P < 0.05). In the AS group, the reduction of fat-free mass (FFM) was significantly lower than that in the other groups. Mean changes in 12MWRT increased significantly in the intervention groups. The mean change in the sit-to-stand scores was not statistically significant between the three groups. Comparing the intervention groups showed that mean changes in 1RM variables increased in AS group (P = 0.03).\n\nConclusions: The aerobic and aerobic-strength exercise programs were not more effective than control on the primary outcome of body composition in patients with morbid obesity following bariatric surgery.",

For cellulitis without purulent drainage, \u041e\u0406-hemolytic streptococci are \npresumed to be the predominant pathogens. It is unknown if antimicrobial \nregimens possessing in vitro MRSA activity provide improved outcomes compared \nwith treatments lacking MRSA activity.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine whether cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole \nyields a higher clinical cure rate of uncomplicated cellulitis than cephalexin \nalone.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized \nsuperiority trial in 5 US emergency departments among outpatients older than 12 \nyears with cellulitis and no wound, purulent drainage, or abscess enrolled from \nApril 2009 through June 2012. All participants had soft tissue ultrasound \nperformed at the time of enrollment to exclude abscess. Final follow-up was \nAugust 2012.\nINTERVENTIONS: Cephalexin, 500 mg 4 times daily, plus \ntrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily, for 7 days (n\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030248 \nparticipants) or cephalexin plus placebo for 7 days (n\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030248 participants).\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome determined a priori in the \nper-protocol group was clinical cure, defined as absence of these clinical \nfailure criteria at follow-up visits: fever; increase in erythema (>25%), \nswelling, or tenderness (days 3-4); no decrease in erythema, swelling, or \ntenderness (days 8-10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness \n(days 14-21). A clinically significant difference was defined as greater than \n10%.\nRESULTS: Among 500 randomized participants, 496 (99%) were included in the \nmodified intention-to-treat analysis and 411 (82.2%) in the per-protocol \nanalysis (median age, 40 years [range, 15-78 years]; 58.4% male; 10.9% had \ndiabetes). Median length and width of erythema were 13.0 cm and 10.0 cm. In the \nper-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 182 (83.5%) of 218 \nparticipants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 165 \n(85.5%) of 193 in the cephalexin group (difference, -2.0%; 95% CI, -9.7% to \n5.7%; P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030.50). In the modified intention-to-treat population, clinical cure \noccurred in 189 (76.2%) of 248 participants in the cephalexin plus \ntrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 171 (69.0%) of 248 in the cephalexin \ngroup (difference, 7.3%; 95% CI, -1.0% to 15.5%; P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030.07). Between-group adverse \nevent rates and secondary outcomes through 7 to 9 weeks, including overnight \nhospitalization, recurrent skin infections, and similar infection in household \ncontacts, did not differ significantly.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with uncomplicated cellulitis, the use \nof cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared to cephalexin alone \ndid not result in higher rates of clinical resolution of cellulitis in the \nper-protocol analysis. However, because imprecision around the findings in the \nmodified intention-to-treat analysis included a clinically important difference \nfavoring cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, further research may be \nneeded.",

Between-group adverse event rates and secondary outcomes through \n7 to 9 weeks, including overnight hospitalization, recurrent skin infections, \nand similar infection in household contacts, did not differ significantly.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was not \nmore effective than cephalexin alone in patients with uncomplicated cellulitis.",

We hypothesized that \nthe addition of acetaminophen to a multimodal analgesia regimen would provide \nimproved pain management in patients after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and \nthat the effect of acetaminophen would be variable based on the route of \ndelivery.\nMETHODS: The study was a single-center, randomized, double-blinded, \nplacebo-controlled clinical trial on the efficacy of IV vs oral acetaminophen in \npatients undergoing unilateral TKA. One hundred seventy-four subjects were \nrandomized to one of the 3 groups: IV acetaminophen group (IV group, n = 57) \nreceived 1 g IV acetaminophen and oral placebo before postanesthesia care unit \n(PACU) admission; oral acetaminophen group (PO group, n = 58) received 1 g oral \nacetaminophen and volume-matched IV normal saline; placebo group (Placebo group, \nn = 59) received oral placebo and volume-matched IV normal saline. The primary \noutcome was average PACU pain scores. Secondary outcomes included maximum pain \nscore, pain scores before physical therapy, total opiate consumption, time to \nPACU discharge, time to rescue analgesia, and time to breakthrough pain.\nRESULTS: The average PACU pain score was 0.56 \u00b1 0.99 (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) \nin the IV group compared with 0.67 \u00b1 1.20 in the PO group (P = .84) and 0.58 \u00b1 \n0.99 in the Placebo group (P = .71). Total opiate consumption at 6 hours (0.47 \nmg hydromorphone equivalents \u00b1 0.56 vs 0.54 \u00b1 0.53 vs 0.54 \u00b1 0.61; P = .69) \nand at 24 hours (1.25 \u00b1 1.30 vs 1.49 \u00b1 1.34 vs 1.36 \u00b1 1.31; P = .46) were \nalso similar between the IV, PO, and Placebo groups. No significant differences \nwere found between all groups for any other outcome.\nCONCLUSION: IV acetaminophen was not more effective on average PACU pain scores \nthan oral acetaminophen or placebo in patients undergoing TKA.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The efficacy of intravenous (IV) acetaminophen compared with its \noral formulation for postoperative analgesia is unknown. We hypothesized that \nthe addition of acetaminophen to a multimodal analgesia regimen would provide \nimproved pain management in patients after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and \nthat the effect of acetaminophen would be variable based on the route of \ndelivery.\nMETHODS: The study was a single-center, randomized, double-blinded, \nplacebo-controlled clinical trial on the efficacy of IV vs oral acetaminophen in \npatients undergoing unilateral TKA. One hundred seventy-four subjects were \nrandomized to one of the 3 groups: IV acetaminophen group (IV group, n\u0412\u00a0= 57) \nreceived 1 g IV acetaminophen and oral placebo before postanesthesia care unit \n(PACU) admission; oral acetaminophen group (PO group, n\u0412\u00a0= 58) received 1 g oral \nacetaminophen and volume-matched IV normal saline; placebo group (Placebo group, \nn\u0412\u00a0= 59) received oral placebo and volume-matched IV normal saline. Pain scores \nwere obtained every 15\u0412\u00a0minutes during PACU stay. Average pain scores, maximum \npain score, and pain scores before physical therapy were compared among the 3 \ngroups. Secondary outcomes included total opiate consumption, time to PACU \ndischarge, time to rescue analgesia, and time to breakthrough pain.\nRESULTS: The average PACU pain score was similar in the IV group (0.56 \u0412\u00b1 0.99 \n[mean \u0412\u00b1 standard deviation]) compared with the PO group (0.67 \u0412\u00b1 1.20; P\u0412\u00a0= .84) \nand Placebo group (0.58 \u0412\u00b1 0.99; P\u0412\u00a0= .71). Total opiate consumption at 6\u0412\u00a0hours \n(0.47 mg hydromorphone equivalents \u0412\u00b1 0.56 vs 0.54 \u0412\u00b1 0.53 vs 0.54 \u0412\u00b1 0.61; P\u0412\u00a0= \n.69) and at 24\u0412\u00a0hours (1.25 \u0412\u00b1 1.30 vs 1.49 \u0412\u00b1 1.34 vs 1.36 \u0412\u00b1 1.31; P\u0412\u00a0= .46) were \nalso similar between the IV, PO, and Placebo groups. No significant differences \nwere found between all groups for any other outcome.\nCONCLUSION: Neither IV nor oral acetaminophen provides additional analgesia in \nthe immediate postoperative period when administered as an adjunct to multimodal \nanalgesia in patients undergoing TKA in the setting of a spinal anesthetic.",

Three hundred \nfifty-five adult, unconscious patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were \nenrolled from February 16, 2013, to June 1, 2016, with final follow-up on \nDecember 27, 2016.\nINTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to TTM (33\u0432\u0402\u2030\u0412\u00b1\u0432\u0402\u20301\u0412\u00b0C) for 48 hours (n\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030176) \nor 24 hours (n\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030179), followed by gradual rewarming of 0.5\u0412\u00b0C per hour until \nreaching 37\u0412\u00b0C.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was 6-month neurologic outcome, \nwith a Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) score of 1 or 2 used to define \nfavorable outcome. Secondary outcomes included 6-month mortality, including time \nto death, the occurrence of adverse events, and intensive care unit resource \nuse.\nRESULTS: In 355 patients who were randomized (mean age, 60 years; 295 [83%] \nmen), 351 (99%) completed the trial. Of these patients, 69% (120/175) in the \n48-hour group had a favorable outcome at 6 months compared with 64% (112/176) in \nthe 24-hour group (difference, 4.9%; 95% CI, -5% to 14.8%; relative risk [RR], \n1.08; 95% CI, 0.93-1.25; P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030.33). Six-month mortality was 27% (48/175) in the \n48-hour group and 34% (60/177) in the 24-hour group (difference, -6.5%; 95% CI, \n-16.1% to 3.1%; RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.59-1.11; P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030.19). There was no significant \ndifference in the time to mortality between the 48-hour group and the 24-hour \ngroup (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.54-1.15; P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030.22). Adverse events were more \ncommon in the 48-hour group (97%) than in the 24-hour group (91%) (difference, \n5.6%; 95% CI, 0.6%-10.6%; RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.12; P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030.04). The median \nlength of intensive care unit stay (151 vs 117 hours; P\u0432\u0402\u2030<\u0432\u0402\u2030.001), but not \nhospital stay (11 vs 12 days; P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030.50), was longer in the 48-hour group than in \nthe 24-hour group.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In unconscious survivors from out-of-hospital cardiac \narrest admitted to the ICU, targeted temperature management at 33\u0412\u00b0C for 48 hours \ndid not significantly improve 6-month neurologic outcome compared with targeted \ntemperature management at 33\u0412\u00b0C for 24 hours. However, the study may have had \nlimited power to detect clinically important differences, and further research \nmay be warranted.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: International resuscitation guidelines recommend targeted \ntemperature management (TTM) at 33\u00b0C to 36\u00b0C in unconscious patients with \nout-of-hospital cardiac arrest for at least 24 hours, but the optimal duration \nof TTM is uncertain.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine whether TTM at 33\u00b0C for 48 hours results in better \nneurologic outcomes compared with currently recommended, standard, 24-hour TTM.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was an international, \ninvestigator-initiated, blinded-outcome-assessor, parallel, pragmatic, \nmulticenter, randomized clinical superiority trial in 10 intensive care units \n(ICUs) at 10 university hospitals in 6 European countries. Three hundred \nfifty-five adult, unconscious patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were \nenrolled from February 16, 2013, to June 1, 2016, with final follow-up on \nDecember 27, 2016.\nINTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to TTM (33 \u00b1 1\u00b0C) for 48 hours (n = 176) \nor 24 hours (n = 179), followed by gradual rewarming of 0.5\u00b0C per hour until \nreaching 37\u00b0C.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was 6-month neurologic outcome, \nwith a Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) score of 1 or 2 used to define \nfavorable outcome. Secondary outcomes included 6-month mortality, including time \nto death, the occurrence of adverse events, and intensive care unit resource \nuse.\nRESULTS: In 355 patients who were randomized (mean age, 60 years; 295 [83%] \nmen), 351 (99%) completed the trial. Of these patients, 120/175 (69%) in the \n48-hour group had a favorable outcome at 6 months compared with 112/176 (64%) in \nthe 24-hour group (difference, 4.9%; 95% CI, -5% to 14.8%; relative risk [RR], \n1.08; 95% CI, 0.93-1.25; P = .33). Six-month mortality was 48/175 (27%) in the \n48-hour group and 60/177 (34%) in the 24-hour group (difference, -6.5%; 95% CI, \n-16.1% to 3.1%; RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.59-1.11; P = .19). Time to mortality \nbetween the 48-hour group and the 24-hour group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, \n0.54-1.15; P = .22). Adverse events occurred in 97% of the 48-hour group and 91% \nof the 24-hour group (difference, 5.6%; 95% CI, 0.6%-10.6%; RR, 1.06; 95% CI, \n1.01-1.12; P = .04). The median length of intensive care unit stay was 151 hours \nin the 48-hour group versus 117 hours in the 24-hour group (P < .001), and \nhospital stay was 11 versus 12 days (P = .50).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Targeted temperature management at 33\u00b0C for 48 hours \nwas not more effective on 6-month neurologic outcome than targeted temperature \nmanagement at 33\u00b0C for 24 hours in unconscious survivors from out-of-hospital \ncardiac arrest admitted to the ICU.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Shoulder arthroplasty is the fastest growing joint replacement \nsurgery in the United States, and optimal postoperative pain management is \ncritical to optimize outcomes for these surgeries. Liposomal bupivacaine (LB) \nhas gained popularity for its potential to provide extended postoperative pain \nrelief with possibly fewer side effects. The goal of this study was to assess \nthe impact of LB compared with continuous interscalene nerve block (CISB) in \nterms of postoperative pain control after shoulder arthroplasty surgery.\nMETHODS: A prospective randomized controlled clinical trial compared consecutive \npatients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty treated with CISB vs. LB with a single \nbolus interscalene block. The primary outcome measures included pain assessment \nup to 24 hours after surgery; in addition, all doses and times of narcotics \nadministered during the inpatient stay were recorded. Patient-reported outcome \nmeasures for pain, satisfaction, and functional outcomes were recorded \npostoperatively.\nRESULTS: A total of 70 of 74 consecutive patients who underwent shoulder \narthroplasty were included in the study. The LB group had equivalent narcotic \nuse, pain scores, and time to first narcotic rescue compared with the CISB group \nwithin the first 24 hours (P > .05). The LB group had higher American Shoulder \nand Elbow Surgeons score and Penn Shoulder Score at final follow-up. There was \nan increased number of complications and cost for the CISB group.\nCONCLUSION: Liposomal bupivacaine was not more effective on pain control than \ncontinuous interscalene nerve block in patients with shoulder arthroplasty.",

Forty-one women were randomized to a 6-month intervention: \ntelemedicine with Wi-Fi scales, text messaging (texting), or enhanced usual care \n(EUC). The primary outcome was weight loss. Changes in anthropometrics and \npsychosocial measures were analyzed.\nRESULTS: One-third of survey participants lacked awareness that obesity \nincreased the risk of EC, and 40% misclassified their body mass. There were no \nsignificant differences in weight loss across interventions (mean = -4.4 kg, \nSD = 6.5 kg). Telemedicine showed improvements in physical health and \ncancer-related body image (Ps = 0.04) compared to texting and in sexual \nfunctioning compared to EUC (P = 0.03). Total physical activity was increased in \nEUC compared with telemedicine (P = 0.01), and vigorous physical activity was \nincreased in EUC compared with both interventions (P = 0.01-0.03); walking \nsignificantly increased in texting compared with telemedicine (P = 0.02).\nCONCLUSIONS: Technology-based interventions were not more effective than \nenhanced usual care for weight loss in EC survivors with obesity.",

Forty-one women were randomized to a 6-month intervention: \ntelemedicine with Wi-Fi scales, text messaging (texting), or enhanced usual care \n(EUC). Changes in anthropometrics and psychosocial measures were analyzed.\nRESULTS: One-third of survey participants lacked awareness that obesity \nincreased the risk of EC, and 40% misclassified their body mass. There were no \nsignificant differences in weight loss across interventions (mean\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030-4.4 kg, \nSD\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u20306.5 kg). Telemedicine showed improvements in physical health and \ncancer-related body image (Ps\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u20300.04) compared to texting and in sexual \nfunctioning compared to EUC (P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u20300.03). Total physical activity was increased in \nEUC compared with telemedicine (P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u20300.01), and vigorous physical activity was \nincreased in EUC compared with both interventions (P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u20300.01-0.03); walking \nsignificantly increased in texting compared with telemedicine (P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u20300.02).\nCONCLUSIONS: Technology-based lifestyle interventions in EC survivors with \nobesity were accessible and resulted in weight loss and improved quality of \nlife. EUC also produced weight loss, demonstrating a potential for beginning \nweight management with information on specific diet and exercise goals.",

Liposomal bupivacaine may provide prolonged analgesic \nduration when injected into the surrounding tissues. The purpose of this study \nwas to compare the analgesic efficacy and serum bupivacaine levels of a \ncontinuous femoral nerve block (CFNB) with bupivacaine to PAI with liposomal \nbupivacaine.\nMETHODS: Sixty-five patients undergoing primary unilateral total knee \narthroplasty were randomized into 2 groups: (1) CFNB and PAI with bupivacaine \n(CFNB group) or (2) PAI with bupivacaine:liposomal bupivacaine mixture at the \nend of surgery (LB group). The primary outcome was pain intensity at maximum \nknee flexion 24 hours following surgery. Secondary outcomes included pain \nintensities at rest and movement at timed intervals and serum bupivacaine \nlevels.\nRESULTS: Patients in the CFNB group experienced lower pain scores at maximum \nknee flexion at 24 hours (7.91; 95% confidence interval, 7.19-8.61) compared to \nthe LB group (8.95; 95% confidence interval, 8.42-9.48; P = .02). The mean peak \nserum bupivacaine level in the LB group up to 72 hours was 0.55 \u03bcg/mL versus 1.4 \n\u03bcg/mL for CFNB group (P = .0008) with one patient in the CFNB group exceeding \nthe reported minimum serum bupivacaine threshold for toxicity.\nCONCLUSION: CFNB was more effective than PAI with liposomal bupivacaine on pain \nintensity at maximum knee flexion at 24 hours in patients undergoing total knee \narthroplasty.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Local periarticular infiltration (PAI) analgesia has emerged as an \nimportant component of multimodal approaches to treat total knee arthroplasty \npostoperative pain. Liposomal bupivacaine may provide prolonged analgesic \nduration when injected into the surrounding tissues. The purpose of this study \nwas to compare the analgesic efficacy and serum bupivacaine levels of a \ncontinuous femoral nerve block (CFNB) with bupivacaine to PAI with liposomal \nbupivacaine.\nMETHODS: Sixty-five patients undergoing primary unilateral total knee \narthroplasty were randomized into 2 groups: (1) CFNB and PAI with bupivacaine \n(CFNB group) or (2) PAI with bupivacaine:liposomal bupivacaine mixture at the \nend of surgery (LB group). The primary outcome was pain intensity at maximum \nknee flexion 24\u0412\u00a0hours following surgery. Secondary outcomes included pain \nintensities at rest and movement at timed intervals and serum bupivacaine \nlevels.\nRESULTS: Patients in the CFNB group experienced lower pain scores at maximum \nknee flexion at 24\u0412\u00a0hours (7.91; 95% confidence interval, 7.19-8.61) compared to \nthe LB group (8.95; 95% confidence interval, 8.42-9.48; P\u0412\u00a0= .02). The mean peak \nserum bupivacaine level in the LB group up to 72\u0412\u00a0hours was 0.55 \u041e\u0458g/mL versus 1.4 \n\u041e\u0458g/mL for CFNB group (P\u0412\u00a0= .0008) with one patient in the CFNB group exceeding \nthe reported minimum serum bupivacaine threshold for toxicity.\nCONCLUSION: While similar pain control was observed on the day of surgery for \nboth groups, patients with a CFNB experienced lower pain intensities during \nmaximum knee flexion at 24\u0412\u00a0hours. Total serum concentrations in LB group \nremained below the toxicity threshold over the study period.",

Severe obesity is considered a state of meta-inflammation \nassociated with obesity that influences the development of chronic-degenerative \ndiseases.\nOBJECTIVE: We aimed to establish the immunometabolic differences in bariatric \npatients and to determine whether cellular immunity is associated with metabolic \nchanges.\nMETHODOLOGY: We conducted an observational study in patients who underwent \nlaparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass \n(LRYGB). We explored the differences in the immunometabolic profile before and \nafter surgery in the study group, by surgical technique, and we evaluated the \nchanges in immunological variables as a function of metabolic variables with \ncorrelation analysis.\nRESULTS: The follow-up rate was 88.7%. After the intervention, there were \nchanges in cellular immunity, with a decrease in effector T lymphocytes \n(CD8+CD28-) and an increase in B lymphocytes, memory helper T cells, and \ncytotoxic T lymphocytes. LSG resulted in a decrease in (CD4+CD62-) T \nlymphocytes compared with LRYGB. Patients who underwent surgery with LRYGB \nshowed clinical and metabolic changes, as well as changes in obesity-associated \nmedical problems. Women who underwent LRYGB showed a reduction in fat-free mass \ncompared with women who underwent LSG.\nCONCLUSION: Bariatric surgery leads to immunometabolic changes in patients with \nsevere obesity.",
