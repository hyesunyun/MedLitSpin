254,18237696,Prospective randomized comparison of anatomic single- and double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy",  Focus on (+) secondary endpoint,,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Purpose
To determine if anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is superior to anatomic single-bundle reconstruction in restoring the stabilities and functions of the knee joint.
Methods
A prospective randomized clinical study was done to compare the results of 32 cases of anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction and 34 cases of anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction with average follow-up of 16.3 В± 3.1В months. Tunnel placements of all the cases were measured on 3D CT. Clinical results were collected after reconstruction; graft's appearance, meniscus status and cartilage state under arthroscopy were compared and analysed too.
Results
Tunnel placements, confirmed with 3D CT, were in the anatomic positions as described in literature both in SB and DB group. No differences were found between SB and DB groups in clinical outcome scores, pivot shift test and KT 1000В measurements (average side-to-side difference for anterior tibial translation was 0.7В mm in SB group and 1.0В mm in DB group). More than 70 % of the single-bundle graft and AM bundle graft in DB group appeared excellent, but only 44.1 % of PL bundle grafts in DB group were excellent and 11.8 % were in poor state. No new menisci tear was found either in SB or DB group, however, in DB group cartilage damages in medial patella-femoral joint occurred in 38.2 % cases. This rate was significantly higher than in the SB group which is only 9.3 %.
Conclusion
Both single- and double-bundle anatomic ACL reconstruction can restore the knee's stability and functions very well. However, more incidences of poor PL status and medial patellar-femoral cartilage damage may occur in double-bundle ACL reconstruction.",no_spin,7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.34758129715919495, 'probability': 0.706394612789154}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -0.9673523902893066, 'probability': 0.3800880014896393}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.48554861545562744, 'probability': 0.6153594851493835}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.29181355237960815, 'probability': 0.7469077706336975}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.7315593361854553, 'probability': 0.4811581075191498}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.43780118227005005, 'probability': 0.6454541087150574}]",7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.32703420519828796, 'probability': 0.7210590839385986}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -0.9766585826873779, 'probability': 0.3765672743320465}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.4543032944202423, 'probability': 0.6348901391029358}]",7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.3419904112815857, 'probability': 0.7103549838066101}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.258004069328308, 'probability': 0.28422075510025024}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.3338506817817688, 'probability': 0.7161606550216675}]",7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.17796695232391357, 'probability': 0.8369700908660889}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.0518510341644287, 'probability': 0.3492905795574188}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.465389609336853, 'probability': 0.627890408039093}]"

METHODS: We enrolled children aged 6 months to 6 years in a double-blind, 
randomized controlled trial of patients presenting to a pediatric emergency 
department. Subjects were randomized to receive a 20 mL/kg infusion of either 5% 
dextrose in normal saline solution or normal saline solution. Serum ketone

Despite intensive marketing by the manufacturers, this claim has not yet been confirmed in a controlled prospective trial.

Questions/purposes: We (1) compared three-planar component alignment and overall coronal mechanical alignment between PSG and conventional instrumentation and (2) logged the need for applying changes in the suggested position of the PSG.

Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, we enrolled 128 patients. The primary outcome was overall coronal mechanical alignment. Secondary outcomes included femoral coronal alignment, femoral axial alignment, tibial coronal alignment, and tibial sagittal alignment. In the PSG cohort, surgical navigation was used as an intraoperative control. When the suggested cut deviated more than 3° from target, the use of PSG was abandoned and marked as an outlier. When cranial-caudal position or size was adapted, the PSG was marked as modified. All patients underwent long-leg standing radiography and CT scan. Deviation of more than 3° from the target in any plane was defined as an outlier.

Results: The PSG and conventional cohorts showed similar numbers of outliers in overall coronal alignment (25% versus 28%; p = 0.69). There were more outliers in tibial coronal (15% versus 3%; p = 0.03) and sagittal (21% versus 3%; p = 0.002) alignment in the PSG group than in the conventional group. The PSG group showed similar outlier rates for femoral coronal alignment (7% versus 14%; p = 0.24) and femoral axial alignment (23% versus 17%; p = 0.50).

Despite intensive marketing by the manufacturers, this claim has not yet been confirmed in a controlled prospective trial.

Questions/purposes: We (1) compared three-planar component alignment and overall coronal mechanical alignment between PSG and conventional instrumentation and (2) logged the need for applying changes in the suggested position of the PSG.

Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, we enrolled 128 patients. In the PSG cohort, surgical navigation was used as an intraoperative control. When the suggested cut deviated more than 3Ў from target, the use of PSG was abandoned and marked as an outlier. When cranial-caudal position or size was adapted, the PSG was marked as modified. All patients underwent long-leg standing radiography and CT scan. Deviation of more than 3Ў from the target in any plane was defined as an outlier.

Results: The PSG and conventional cohorts showed similar numbers of outliers in overall coronal alignment (25% versus 28%; p = 0.69), femoral coronal alignment (7% versus 14%) (p = 0.24), and femoral axial alignment (23% versus 17%; p = 0.50). There were more outliers in tibial coronal (15% versus 3%; p = 0.03) and sagittal 21% versus 3%; p = 0.002) alignment in the PSG group than in the conventional group. PSGs were abandoned in 14 patients (22%) and modified in 18 (28%).

Among the video laryngoscope cohort, a smaller subgroup of severe head injury trauma patients identified retrospectively seemed to be associated with a greater incidence of hypoxia of 80% or less and mortality.",no_spin,5,5,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.28433042764663696, 'probability': 0.7525178790092468}, {'token': 28782, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.2688385248184204, 'probability': 0.2811580002307892}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.5599729418754578, 'probability': 0.5712245106697083}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.21373674273490906, 'probability': 0.807560920715332}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.914993405342102, 'probability': 0.4005192518234253}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.3612801134586334, 'probability': 0.6967837810516357}]",6,6,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.3460550308227539, 'probability': 0.7074735164642334}, {'token': 28784, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.3506401777267456, 'probability': 0.2590743601322174}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.3600671589374542, 'probability': 0.6976295113563538}]",7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.3693419396877289, 'probability': 0.6911890506744385}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.4413212537765503, 'probability': 0.23661494255065918}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.300516277551651, 'probability': 0.740435779094696}]",7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.18373234570026398, 'probability': 0.8321585059165955}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.136254906654358, 'probability': 0.3210190236568451}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.37397947907447815, 'probability': 0.6879910230636597}]"

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of the two procedures in patients older than 55 years of age affected by reparable rotator cuff tears with concomitant long head biceps pathologies.

Methods: Patients older than 55 years of age with long head biceps lesions and reparable rotator cuff tears were selected for this study. A total of 151 patients were randomly assigned to the tenotomy group (77 patients) or the tenodesis group (74 patients). Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was performed in all the patients. Before surgery, physical and radiological examinations were performed; the constant score was measured as well. After the operation, the surgical time, cost, pain (VAS scores), Popeye sign, cramping pain, constant scores, satisfaction level and the elbow flexion and forearm supination strength indices were recorded.

Results: Patients were followed for an average of 24 months. No significant differences in the clinical results for the constant scores, the forearm supination and elbow flexion strength indices, Popeye sign, cramping pain and satisfaction level were found between the groups. However, tenotomy required a shorter surgical time (40.4 ± 4.0 vs. 50.4 ± 5.9 min, P < 0.001) and resulted in faster pain relief (3.1 ± 1.8 vs. 4.8 ± 1.9, P < 0.001).

Conclusion: Both tenotomy and tenodesis are effective and equal for the treatment of long head biceps lesions.

262,24072627,Randomized trial of hemiarthroplasty versus internal fixation for femoral neck fractures: no differences at 6 years.,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,  Focus on (+) secondary endpoint,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Background: Hemiarthroplasty has been shown superior to internal fixation for displaced femoral neck fractures (FNF) in the first 2 years. However, there are unanswered questions about the performance of hemiarthroplasty over the longer term compared with internal fixation.

Questions/purposes: We sought to compare hemiarthroplasty with internal fixation in terms of (1) outcomes scores for pain, hip function, and quality of life at a minimum of 5 years after surgery in a randomized trial. A secondary purpose was to compare (2) patient survival and (3) frequency of reoperation in the two groups.

Methods: A total of 222 consecutive patients older than 60 years, including those cognitively impaired, with FNF were randomized to either internal fixation with two parallel screws or bipolar hemiarthroplasty. At a minimum followup of 4.9 years (mean, 5.9 years; range, 4.9-7.2 years), 68 of the 70 surviving patients were examined by a study nurse and study physiotherapist blinded to initial treatment. Questionnaires on hip function (Harris hip score), quality of life (Eq5D), and activity of daily living function (Barthel ADL) were administered. The Barthel ADL index score was split into good function (score 95 or 100) and reduced function (score below 95).

Results: The mean survival of the groups was similar with 66.4% (73 of 110) of the patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty and 70.5% (79 of 112) of the patients undergoing internal fixation having died since surgery (p = 0.51). Only 12 of 31 living patients in the internal fixation group had retained their native hips at a mean of 6 years. Between 2 and 6 years, there were two new major reoperations (both in the internal fixation group, for avascular necrosis and deep wound infection). The mean Harris hip score was 66 (SD 19) and 67 (SD 20) in the internal fixation and hemiarthroplasty groups, respectively (p = 0.96). The mean Eq5D index was 0.50 (SD 0.40) in the internal fixation group and 0.34 (SD 0.36) in the hemiarthroplasty group (p = 0.10).

263,24072627,Randomized trial of hemiarthroplasty versus internal fixation for femoral neck fractures: no differences at 6 years.,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,  Focus on (+) secondary endpoint,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Background: Hemiarthroplasty has been shown superior to internal fixation for displaced femoral neck fractures (FNF) in the first 2 years. However, there are unanswered questions about the performance of hemiarthroplasty over the longer term compared with internal fixation.

Questions/purposes: We sought to compare hemiarthroplasty with internal fixation in terms of (1) outcomes scores for pain, hip function, and quality of life at a minimum of 5 years after surgery in a randomized trial. A secondary purpose was to compare (2) patient survival and (3) frequency of reoperation in the two groups.

Methods: A total of 222 consecutive patients older than 60 years, including those cognitively impaired, with FNF were randomized to either internal fixation with two parallel screws or bipolar hemiarthroplasty. The primary outcome was hip function measured by the Harris hip score. Secondary outcomes included quality of life (Eq5D), activity of daily living function (Barthel ADL), patient survival, and frequency of reoperation. At a minimum followup of 4.9 years (mean, 5.9 years; range, 4.9-7.2 years), 68 of the 70 surviving patients were examined by a study nurse and study physiotherapist blinded to initial treatment. The Barthel ADL index score was split into good function (score 95 or 100) and reduced function (score below 95).

Results: The mean survival of the groups was similar with 66.4% (73 of 110) of the patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty and 70.5% (79 of 112) of the patients undergoing internal fixation having died since surgery (p = 0.51). Only 12 of 31 living patients in the internal fixation group had retained their native hips at a mean of 6 years. Between 2 and 6 years, there were two new major reoperations (both in the internal fixation group, for avascular necrosis and deep wound infection). The mean Harris hip score was 66 (SD 19) and 67 (SD 20) in the internal fixation and hemiarthroplasty groups, respectively (p = 0.96). The mean Eq5D index was 0.50 (SD 0.40) in the internal fixation group and 0.34 (SD 0.36) in the hemiarthroplasty group (p = 0.10). Function in terms of ADLs was comparable between the groups; of the patients in the internal fixation group, 42% reported good function on the Barthel ADL index, and the corresponding number in the hemiarthroplasty group was 51% (p = 0.44).

Most MIS TKA surgeons (and many surgeons who use other approaches as well) excise the fat pad for better exposure of the knee. There is still controversy about the result of fat pad excision on patella baja, pain, and function.

Questions/purposes: In the setting of a randomized controlled trial, we sought to determine whether infrapatellar fat pad excision during MIS TKA causes (1) patellar tendon shortening (as measured by patella baja); (2) increased anterior knee pain; (3) decreases in the Knee Society Score or functional subscore; or (4) more patella-related complications.

Methods: We randomized 90 patients undergoing MIS TKA at one institution into two groups. In one group, 45 patients underwent MIS TKA with complete infrapatellar fat pad excision and in the other group, 45 patients received MIS TKA without infrapatellar fat pad excision. The patella was selectively resurfaced in these patients; there was no difference between the groups in terms of the percentage of patients whose patellae were resurfaced. We measured patellar tendon shortening, knee flexion, anterior knee pain, Knee Society Score (KSS), functional subscore, and patellar complications at preoperative and postoperative periods of 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year; complete followup data were available on 86% of patients (77 of 90) who were enrolled.

Results: At the final followup, no significant differences were observed in patellar tendon shortening, KSS, functional subscore, or knee flexion in either group. However, patients with their infrapatellar fat pad excised experienced more anterior knee pain (8.3% versus 0%; p = 0.03; 95% confidence interval, -0.007 to 0.174) at the end of the study. No patellar complications were found in either group.

recommended as a safe, effective alternative to epidural analgesia plus 
single-injection FNB after TKA. Improved analgesic efficacy in the group that 
received epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB must be weighed against 
the disadvantage of a higher likelihood of knee buckling and delayed ambulation 
with that treatment approach.

because of their ability to engage the reader. Our objective was to evaluate the 
effectiveness of story booklets compared to standard information sheets for 
parents of children attending the emergency department (ED) with a child with 
croup.
METHODS: Parents were randomized to receive story booklets (n=208) or standard 
information sheets (n=205) during their ED visit. The primary outcome was change 
in anxiety between triage to ED discharge as measured by the State-Trait Anxiety 
Inventory. Follow-up telephone interviews were conducted at 1 and 3 days after 
discharge, then every other day until 9 days (or until resolution of symptoms), 
and at 1 year. Secondary outcomes included: expected future anxiety, event 
impact, parental knowledge, satisfaction, decision regret, healthcare 
utilization, time to symptom resolution.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the primary outcome of change in 
parental anxiety between recruitment and ED discharge (change of 5 points for 
the story group vs. 6 points for the comparison group, p=0.78). The story group 
showed significantly greater decision regret regarding their decision to go to 
the ED (p<0.001): 6.7% of the story group vs. 1.5% of the comparison group

48,24225332,Trial to examine text message-based mHealth in emergency department patients with diabetes (TExT-MED): a randomized controlled trial.,Annals of Emergency Medicine,,"""Trend toward significance"" // ""Numerically longer survival"" or equivalent verbiage",Emergency Medicine,claude_4.0-sonnet,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Increasingly, low-income inner-city patients with diabetes 
utilize emergency departments (EDs) for acute and chronic care. We seek to 
determine whether a scalable, low-cost, unidirectional, text message-based 
mobile health intervention (TExT-MED) improves clinical outcomes, increases 
healthy behaviors, and decreases ED utilization in a safety net population.
METHODS: We conducted an randomized controlled trial of 128 adult patients with 
poorly controlled diabetes (glycosylated hemoglobin [Hb A1C] level в‰Ґ8%) in an 
urban, public ED. The TExT-MED group received 2 daily text messages for 6 months 
in English or Spanish. The primary outcome was change in Hb A1C level. Secondary 
outcomes included changes in medication adherence, self-efficacy, performance of 
self-care tasks, quality of life, diabetes-specific knowledge, ED utilization, 
and patient satisfaction.
RESULTS: Hb A1C level decreased by 1.05% in the TExT-MED group compared with 
0.60% in the controls (О”0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.27 to 1.17) at 6 
months. Secondary outcomes favored the TExT-MED group, with the most sizable 
change observed in self-reported medication adherence (as measured by the 
Morisky Medication Adherence Scale, an 8-point validated scale with higher 
scores representing better adherence), which improved from 4.5 to 5.4 in the 
TExT-MED group compared with a net decrease of -0.1 in the controls (О”1.1 [95% 
CI 0.1 to 2.1]). Effects were larger among Spanish speakers for both medication 
adherence (1.1 versus -0.3; О”1.4; 95% CI 0.2 to 2.7) and Hb A1C (-1.2% versus 
-0.4%) in the TExT-MED group. The proportion of patients who used emergency 
services trended lower in the TExT-MED group (35.9% versus 51.6%; О”15.7%; 95% CI 
9.4% to 22%). Overall, 93.6% of respondents enjoyed TExT-MED and 100% would 
recommend it to family/friends.
CONCLUSION: The TExT-MED program did not result in a statistically significant 
improvement in Hb A1C. However, trends toward improvement in the primary outcome 
of Hb A1C and other secondary outcomes, including quality of life, were 
observed, the most pronounced being improved medication adherence. TExT-MED also

utilize emergency departments (EDs) for acute and chronic care. We seek to 
determine whether a scalable, low-cost, unidirectional, text message-based 
mobile health intervention (TExT-MED) improves clinical outcomes, increases 
healthy behaviors, and decreases ED utilization in a safety net population.
METHODS: We conducted an randomized controlled trial of 128 adult patients with 
poorly controlled diabetes (glycosylated hemoglobin [Hb A1C] level ≥8%) in an 
urban, public ED. The TExT-MED group received 2 daily text messages for 6 months 
in English or Spanish. The primary outcome was change in Hb A1C level. Secondary 
outcomes included changes in medication adherence, self-efficacy, performance of 
self-care tasks, quality of life, diabetes-specific knowledge, ED utilization, 
and patient satisfaction.
RESULTS: Hb A1C level decreased by 1.05% in the TExT-MED group compared with 
0.60% in the controls (Δ0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.27 to 1.17) at 6 
months. Self-reported medication adherence (as measured by the Morisky Medication 
Adherence Scale, an 8-point validated scale with higher scores representing 
better adherence) improved from 4.5 to 5.4 in the TExT-MED group compared with 
a net decrease of -0.1 in the controls (Δ1.1 [95% CI 0.1 to 2.1]). The 
proportion of patients who used emergency services was 35.9% in the TExT-MED 
group versus 51.6% in controls (Δ15.7%; 95% CI 9.4% to 22%). Overall, 93.6% of 
respondents enjoyed TExT-MED and 100% would recommend it to family/friends.
CONCLUSION: The TExT-MED program was not more effective on Hb A1C than control 
in patients with poorly controlled diabetes.",spin,5,5,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.4208078682422638, 'probability': 0.6565162539482117}, {'token': 28782, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.3601857423782349, 'probability': 0.2566131353378296}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.7495519518852234, 'probability': 0.4725782573223114}]",7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.2536138594150543, 'probability': 0.7759913206100464}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.0158988237380981, 'probability': 0.36207684874534607}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.5290447473526001, 'probability': 0.5891675353050232}]",5,5,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.3297550678253174, 'probability': 0.7190998196601868}, {'token': 28782, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.4409221410751343, 'probability': 0.2367093861103058}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.4841715097427368, 'probability': 0.6162075400352478}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.365680068731308, 'probability': 0.6937247514724731}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -1.6398011445999146, 'probability': 0.1940186321735382}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.41878342628479004, 'probability': 0.6578466892242432}]",7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.1943122148513794, 'probability': 0.8234007954597473}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.5211255550384521, 'probability': 0.2184658646583557}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.4904435873031616, 'probability': 0.6123546361923218}]"

236,24384945,No difference in blood loss between posterior-cruciate-ligament-retaining and posterior-cruciate-ligament-stabilized total knee arthroplasties.,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy",  Other,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"PURPOSE: Posterior-cruciate-ligament-retaining (PCR) and 
posterior-cruciate-ligament-stabilized (PS) arthroplasties are two major common 
practices in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The hypothesis of the present study 
was that compared with the PCR technique, the PS technique is associated with a 
higher amount of postoperative blood loss and greater need for blood transfusion 
in cemented TKA.
METHODS: In this prospective, randomized study, 100 patients diagnosed with 
primary knee osteoarthritis were randomly assigned to either the PCR group 
(Group I) or the PS group (Group II). The exclusion criteria were 
rheumatological joint disease, previous knee surgery, anticoagulant therapy and 
hypertension. There were no significant differences in age, body mass index and 
gender, between the groups. The haemoglobin and haematocrit levels of each 
patient were recorded preoperatively and on postoperative days 1, 3 and 5. The 
postoperative suction drainage and blood transfusion volumes were also recorded.
RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in haemoglobin or 
haematocrit levels between the groups on postoperative days 1, 3 and 5. There 
were also no statistically significant differences in the total measured blood 
loss volume, postoperative drainage amounts or transfusion rates between the

CONCLUSION: Use of the PS technique during cemented TKA does not appear to 
influence the amount of perioperative blood loss or the need for postoperative 
blood transfusion in general. The clinical relevance of this study is that the 
difference in blood loss between the PCR and PS techniques does not need to be

Although positive effects were found after physiotherapy, the recurrence and prolonged disability of a frozen shoulder are major factors to focus on to provide the appropriate treatment.

Questions/purposes: We wished to study the effectiveness of a shoulder countertraction apparatus on ROM, pain, and function in patients with a frozen shoulder and compare their results with those of control subjects who received conventional physiotherapy.

Methods: A total of 100 participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group and a control group, with each group having 50 participants. The control group received physiotherapy and the experimental group received countertraction and physiotherapy. The total treatment time was 20 minutes a day for 5 days per week for 2 weeks. The outcome measures used were goniometer measurements, VAS, and the Oxford Shoulder Score.

Results: Improvements were seen in the scores for shoulder flexion (94.1Ў ± 19.79Ў at baseline increased to 161.9Ў ± 13.05Ў after intervention), abduction ROM (90.4Ў ± 21.18Ў at baseline increased to 154.8Ў ± 13.21Ў after intervention), and pain (8.00 ± 0.78 at baseline decreased to 3.48 ± 0.71 after intervention) in the experimental group.

Methods: Between January 2007 and January 2011, 87 patients who underwent arthroscopic Bankart repair with the use of knot-tying suture anchors or knotless suture anchors were evaluated, with 45 patients in the knot-tying suture group and 42 patients in the knotless group. Patients were assigned to either group, with odd-numbered patients going to the knot-tying suture arm and even-numbered patients assigned to the knotless arm. Outcomes included the Constant score, the visual analog scale (VAS) score, patient satisfaction score, and range of motion in forward flexion and external rotation with the arm in adduction. Redislocations or subluxations with the 2 techniques was also studied.

Results: Both groups showed a statistically significant improvement between the preoperative and postoperative VAS scores and Constant scores. In the knot-tying suture group, the VAS score improved from 2.5 ± 2.3 to 0.7 ± 0.5 (P < .05) and the Constant score improved from 64 ± 7 to 92 ± 10 (P < .05). In the knotless group, the VAS score improved from 2.8 ± 2.5 to 0.9 ± 0.6 (P < .05), and the Constant score improved from 62 ± 6 to 89 ± 9 (P < .05). The patient satisfaction scores were 6.9 and 7.1 for the knot tying and knotless groups, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found when comparing the outcomes between the 2 groups. The change in the range of forward flexion and external rotation was also similar in the 2 groups. There was also no difference in recurrence or redislocation rates.

Conclusions: Both the knot-tying and knotless suture anchors groups showed statistically significant and similar improvement in VAS and Constant scores. Both anchors provided reasonable outcomes.

Patients were assigned to either group, with odd-numbered patients going to the knot-tying suture arm and even-numbered patients assigned to the knotless arm. The primary outcome was the Constant score. Secondary outcomes included the visual analog scale (VAS) score, patient satisfaction score, range of motion in forward flexion and external rotation with the arm in adduction, and redislocations or subluxations.

Results: No statistically significant differences were found when comparing the Constant scores between the 2 groups. The knot-tying suture group had a postoperative Constant score of 92 ± 10 and the knotless group had a postoperative Constant score of 89 ± 9. For secondary outcomes, the postoperative VAS scores were 0.7 ± 0.5 and 0.9 ± 0.6 for the knot-tying and knotless groups, respectively. The patient satisfaction scores were 6.9 and 7.1 for the knot tying and knotless groups, respectively. The change in the range of forward flexion and external rotation was similar in the 2 groups. There was no difference in recurrence or redislocation rates between groups.

Conclusions: Knotless suture anchors were not more effective than knot-tying suture anchors on the Constant score in patients undergoing arthroscopic Bankart repairs.",spin,5,5,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.34679684042930603, 'probability': 0.7069489359855652}, {'token': 28782, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.1595855951309204, 'probability': 0.3136161267757416}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.6442388892173767, 'probability': 0.5250620245933533}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.2551625072956085, 'probability': 0.7747905850410461}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.8014315962791443, 'probability': 0.4486861526966095}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.43210434913635254, 'probability': 0.6491416096687317}]",5,5,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.3519609272480011, 'probability': 0.7033076286315918}, {'token': 28782, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.4104787111282349, 'probability': 0.24402642250061035}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.600398063659668, 'probability': 0.5485932230949402}]",5,5,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.4075378477573395, 'probability': 0.6652863025665283}, {'token': 28782, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.6503207683563232, 'probability': 0.19198831915855408}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.4254349172115326, 'probability': 0.6534854769706726}]",7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.20046798884868622, 'probability': 0.818347692489624}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.556053638458252, 'probability': 0.21096698939800262}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.5560735464096069, 'probability': 0.5734562873840332}]"

Questions/purposes: We performed a randomized controlled trial to compare the (1) frequency of recurrent instability and (2) disease-specific quality-of-life scores after treatment of first-time shoulder dislocation using either immobilization in external rotation or immobilization in internal rotation in a group of young patients.

Methods: Sixty patients younger than 35 years of age with primary, traumatic, anterior shoulder dislocations were randomized (concealed, computer-generated) to immobilization with either an internal rotation sling (n = 29) or an external rotation brace (n = 31) at a mean of 4 days after closed reduction (range, 1-7 days).

161,24733157,Arthroscopic Repair of Full-Thickness Rotator Cuff Tears With and Without Acromioplasty: Randomized Prospective Trial With 2-Year Follow-up.,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,  Other,,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Acromioplasty is commonly performed during arthroscopic rotator cuff 
repair, but its effect on short-term outcomes is debated.
PURPOSE: To report the short-term clinical outcomes of patients undergoing 
arthroscopic repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears with and without 
acromioplasty.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: Patients undergoing arthroscopic repair of full-thickness rotator cuff 
tears were randomized into acromioplasty or nonacromioplasty groups. The primary 
outcome was the Simple Shoulder Test (SST). Secondary outcomes included American 
Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, Constant score, University of 
California-Los Angeles (UCLA) score, and Short Form-12 (SF-12) health assessment 
along with physical examination including range of motion and dynamometer 
strength testing. Intraoperative data including tear size, repair configuration, 
and concomitant procedures were recorded. Follow-up examination was performed at 
regular intervals up to 2 years. Preoperative imaging was reviewed to classify 
the acromial morphologic type, acromial angle, and lateral acromial angulation.
RESULTS: A total of 114 patients were initially enrolled in the study, and 95 
(83%; 43 nonacromioplasty, 52 acromioplasty) were available for a minimum 2-year 
follow-up. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics, 
including number of tendons torn, repair configuration, concomitant procedures, 
and acromion type and angles. There were no significant differences in functional

repair, but its effect on short-term outcomes is debated.
PURPOSE: To report the short-term clinical outcomes of patients undergoing 
arthroscopic repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears with and without 
acromioplasty.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: Patients undergoing arthroscopic repair of full-thickness rotator cuff 
tears were randomized into acromioplasty or nonacromioplasty groups. The Simple 
Shoulder Test (SST), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, Constant 
score, University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) score, and Short Form-12 
(SF-12) health assessment were collected along with physical examination 
including range of motion and dynamometer strength testing. Intraoperative data 
including tear size, repair configuration, and concomitant procedures were 
recorded. Follow-up examination was performed at regular intervals up to 2 
years. Preoperative imaging was reviewed to classify the acromial morphologic 
type, acromial angle, and lateral acromial angulation.
RESULTS: A total of 114 patients were initially enrolled in the study, and 95 
(83%; 43 nonacromioplasty, 52 acromioplasty) were available for a minimum 2-year 
follow-up. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics, 
including number of tendons torn, repair configuration, concomitant procedures, 
and acromion type and angles. Within groups, there was a significant (P < .001) 
improvement in all functional outcome scores from preoperatively to all 
follow-up time points, including 2 years, for the nonacromioplasty and 
acromioplasty groups (ASES score: 55.1-91.5, 48.8-89.0; Constant score: 
48.3-75.0, 51.9-78.7, respectively). There were no significant differences in 
functional outcomes between nonacromioplasty and acromioplasty groups or between 
subjects with different acromial features at any time point.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrate no difference in clinical 
outcomes after rotator cuff repair with or without acromioplasty at 2 years 
postoperatively.",no_spin,7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.2845498323440552, 'probability': 0.7523528337478638}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.3094897270202637, 'probability': 0.2699577808380127}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.4890563488006592, 'probability': 0.6132047772407532}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.22204451262950897, 'probability': 0.800879716873169}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.73283451795578, 'probability': 0.48054492473602295}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.3938625752925873, 'probability': 0.674446702003479}]",5,5,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.2798277735710144, 'probability': 0.7559139132499695}, {'token': 28782, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.5396702289581299, 'probability': 0.21445180475711823}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.48384594917297363, 'probability': 0.616408109664917}]",5,5,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.25776833295822144, 'probability': 0.7727741599082947}, {'token': 28782, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.6594657897949219, 'probability': 0.19024057686328888}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.37584611773490906, 'probability': 0.6867080330848694}]",5,5,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.16784827411174774, 'probability': 0.8454821109771729}, {'token': 28782, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.550559163093567, 'probability': 0.21212932467460632}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.5473368763923645, 'probability': 0.5784883499145508}]"

kinetic chain resistance training on anterior knee laxity and function in the 
ACL-injured (ACLI) knee.
METHODS: Fifty-eight ACLI subjects were randomised to one of three (12-week 
duration) training groups. The STAND group trained according to a standardised 
rehabilitation protocol. Subjects in the LOW and HIGH group trained as did the 
STAND group but with the addition of seated knee extensor open kinetic chain 
resistance training at loads of 2 sets of 20 repetition maximum (RM) and 20 sets

RESULTS: The LOW group demonstrated a reduction in 133 N anterior knee laxity

206,24964886,Fluoroscopy and imageless navigation enable an equivalent reconstruction of leg length and global and femoral offset in THA.,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Restoration of biomechanics is a major goal in THA. Imageless 
navigation enables intraoperative control of leg length equalization and offset 
reconstruction. However, the effect of navigation compared with intraoperative 
fluoroscopy is unclear.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether intraoperative use of imageless navigation 
(1) improves the relative accuracy of leg length and global and femoral offset 
restoration; (2) increases the absolute precision of leg length and global and 
femoral offset equalization; and (3) reduces outliers in a reconstruction zone 
of В± 5 mm for leg length and global and femoral offset restoration compared with 
intraoperative fluoroscopy during minimally invasive (MIS) THA with the patient 
in a lateral decubitus position.
METHODS: In this prospective study a consecutive series of 125 patients were 
randomized to either navigation-guided or fluoroscopy-controlled THA using 
sealed, opaque envelopes. All patients received the same cementless prosthetic 
components through an anterolateral MIS approach while they were in a lateral 
decubitus position. Leg length, global or total offset (representing the 
combination of femoral and acetabular offset), and femoral offset differences 
were restored using either navigation or fluoroscopy. Postoperatively, residual 
leg length and global and femoral offset discrepancies were analyzed on 
magnification-corrected radiographs of the pelvis by an independent and blinded 
examiner using digital planning software. Accuracy was defined as the relative 
postoperative difference between the surgically treated and the unaffected 
contralateral side for leg length and offset, respectively; precision was 
defined as the absolute postoperative deviation of leg length and global and 
femoral offset regardless of lengthening or shortening of leg length and offset 
throughout the THA. All analyses were performed per intention-to-treat.
RESULTS: Analyzing the relative accuracy of leg length restoration we found a 
mean difference of 0.2 mm (95% CI, -1.0 to +1.4 mm; p = 0.729) between 
fluoroscopy and navigation, 0.2 mm (95 % CI, -0.9 to +1.3 mm; p = 0.740) for 
global offset and 1.7 mm (95 % CI, +0.4 to +2.9 mm; p = 0.008) for femoral 
offset. For the absolute precision of leg length and global and femoral offset 
equalization, there was a mean difference of 1.7 В± 0.3 mm (p < 0.001) between 
fluoroscopy and navigation. The biomechanical reconstruction with a residual leg 
length and global and femoral offset discrepancy less than 5 mm and less than 8 
mm, respectively, succeeded in 93% and 98%, respectively, in the navigation 
group and in 54% and 95%, respectively, in the fluoroscopy group.

207,24964886,Fluoroscopy and imageless navigation enable an equivalent reconstruction of leg length and global and femoral offset in THA.,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Restoration of biomechanics is a major goal in THA. Imageless 
navigation enables intraoperative control of leg length equalization and offset 
reconstruction. However, the effect of navigation compared with intraoperative 
fluoroscopy is unclear.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether intraoperative use of imageless navigation 
compared with intraoperative fluoroscopy during minimally invasive (MIS) THA 
with the patient in a lateral decubitus position (1) improves the relative 
accuracy of leg length and global and femoral offset restoration; (2) increases 
the absolute precision of leg length and global and femoral offset equalization; 
and (3) reduces outliers in a reconstruction zone of ± 5 mm for leg length and 
global and femoral offset restoration.
METHODS: In this prospective study a consecutive series of 125 patients were 
randomized to either navigation-guided or fluoroscopy-controlled THA using 
sealed, opaque envelopes. All patients received the same cementless prosthetic 
components through an anterolateral MIS approach while they were in a lateral 
decubitus position. The primary outcome was relative accuracy of leg length 
restoration. Secondary outcomes included global offset accuracy, femoral offset 
accuracy, absolute precision of leg length and offset equalization, and outliers 
in reconstruction zones. Postoperatively, residual leg length and global and 
femoral offset discrepancies were analyzed on magnification-corrected 
radiographs of the pelvis by an independent and blinded examiner using digital 
planning software. Accuracy was defined as the relative postoperative difference 
between the surgically treated and the unaffected contralateral side for leg 
length and offset, respectively; precision was defined as the absolute 
postoperative deviation of leg length and global and femoral offset regardless 
of lengthening or shortening of leg length and offset throughout the THA. All 
analyses were performed per intention-to-treat.
RESULTS: For the primary outcome of relative accuracy of leg length restoration, 
there was a mean difference of 0.2 mm (95% CI, -1.0 to +1.4 mm; p = 0.729) 
between fluoroscopy and navigation. For secondary outcomes, global offset showed 
a mean difference of 0.2 mm (95% CI, -0.9 to +1.3 mm; p = 0.740) and femoral 
offset showed a mean difference of 1.7 mm (95% CI, +0.4 to +2.9 mm; p = 0.008). 
For the absolute precision of leg length and global and femoral offset 
equalization, there was a mean difference of 1.7 ± 0.3 mm (p < 0.001) between 
fluoroscopy and navigation. The biomechanical reconstruction with a residual leg 
length and global and femoral offset discrepancy less than 5 mm and less than 8 
mm, respectively, succeeded in 93% and 98%, respectively, in the navigation 
group and in 54% and 95%, respectively, in the fluoroscopy group.
CONCLUSIONS: Imageless navigation was not more effective than intraoperative 
fluoroscopy for leg length restoration in patients undergoing MIS THA with the 
patient in the lateral decubitus position.",spin,5,5,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.4269120693206787, 'probability': 0.6525208950042725}, {'token': 28782, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.3235636949539185, 'probability': 0.2661849856376648}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.5113699436187744, 'probability': 0.5996735095977783}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.3126676380634308, 'probability': 0.7314929962158203}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.8903392553329468, 'probability': 0.4105164408683777}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.31577855348587036, 'probability': 0.7292208671569824}]",5,5,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.36146026849746704, 'probability': 0.6966582536697388}, {'token': 28782, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.4244866371154785, 'probability': 0.24063196778297424}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.42474865913391113, 'probability': 0.653934121131897}]",5,5,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.3907281756401062, 'probability': 0.67656409740448}, {'token': 28782, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.6632481813430786, 'probability': 0.1895223706960678}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.3021988272666931, 'probability': 0.7391911149024963}]",5,5,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.22759538888931274, 'probability': 0.7964463829994202}, {'token': 28782, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.5831166505813599, 'probability': 0.2053341418504715}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.5203266143798828, 'probability': 0.594326376914978}]"

Intravenous morphine has been used as a common method of pain control in emergency care. NebulizedВ fentanylВ is also an effective temporary substitute. This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of nebulized fentanyl with intravenous (IV) morphine on management of acute limb pain.
Methods
This was a placebo-controlled, double-blindВ randomized clinical trial. Ninety emergency department patients with moderate to severe pain aged 15 to 50 years were blocked randomized and enrolled in this study. Forty-seven patients in the experimental group received nebulized fentanyl (4В Ојg/kg) and IV normal saline as placebo, and the remaining 43 patients in the control group received IV morphine (0.1 mg/kg) and nebulized normal saline as placebo. All participants' pain scores were assessed by Numerical Rating Scale before and after intervention at 5-, 10-, 15-, 30-, 45-, and 60-minute intervals. Patients' vital sign and possibleВ adverse effectsВ were recorded respectively. Finally, all participants were assessed for their satisfaction.
Results
The mean initial pain score in the experimental group was 8.7 and 8.4 in the control group (PВ = .1). Pain relief in both groups after 5 and 10 minutes were similar (PВ = .72). Although the pain relief was significantly greater with fentanyl at 15 minutes, this difference is not clinically significant. Pain management in both groups was successful and was more than 3 scores reduction in Numerical Rating Scale. Patient satisfaction in both groups was similar.

in subjects undergoing assessment for acute angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitor-induced angioedema (ACEIA) in an emergency department (ED).
METHODS: This was a multicenter, phase 2, double-blind study with subjects 
randomized to receive a single subcutaneous dose of ecallantide (10, 30, or 60 
mg) or placebo plus physician-directed conventional therapy. The primary 
endpoint was defined as meeting predetermined discharge eligibility criteria 
within 6 hours of study drug administration. Discharge criteria included 
improvement of edema, stable vital signs, absence of stridor, absence of dyspnea 
or use of accessory muscles during respiration, absence of drooling, and ability 
to drink without difficulty.
RESULTS: An interim analysis showed that a high percentage of subjects met the 
primary endpoint, and the study was halted. Overall, 79 subjects were randomized 
and 76 had data for analysis. Most had mild (45%) or moderate (42%) ACEIA. The 
discharge eligibility endpoint was met by 72% of the placebo group and 85%, 89%, 
and 89% of the ecallantide 10-, 30-, and 60-mg groups, respectively. This 
difference in meeting discharge eligibility endpoint criteria between treatment 
groups was not statistically significant. The incidence of treatment-emergent 
adverse events was similar between placebo and active-treatment groups.
CONCLUSION: The addition of ecallantide to standard therapy does not appear to 
improve angioedema compared with placebo in ED patients with ACEIA. Our data 
suggest that most ED patients presenting with mild to moderate ACEIA are likely 
to meet our discharge eligibility criteria within 6 hours of treatment, 
regardless of intervention. Further studies to assess the utility of ecallantide

in subjects undergoing assessment for acute angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitor-induced angioedema (ACEIA) in an emergency department (ED).
METHODS: This was a multicenter, phase 2, double-blind study with subjects 
randomized to receive a single subcutaneous dose of ecallantide (10, 30, or 60 
mg) or placebo plus physician-directed conventional therapy. The primary 
endpoint was defined as meeting predetermined discharge eligibility criteria 
within 6 hours of study drug administration. Discharge criteria included 
improvement of edema, stable vital signs, absence of stridor, absence of dyspnea 
or use of accessory muscles during respiration, absence of drooling, and ability 
to drink without difficulty.
RESULTS: An interim analysis showed that a high percentage of subjects met the 
primary endpoint, and the study was halted. Overall, 79 subjects were randomized 
and 76 had data for analysis. Most had mild (45%) or moderate (42%) ACEIA. The 
discharge eligibility endpoint was met by 72% of the placebo group and 85%, 89%, 
and 89% of the ecallantide 10-, 30-, and 60-mg groups, respectively. This 
difference in meeting discharge eligibility endpoint criteria between treatment 
groups was not statistically significant. The incidence of treatment-emergent 
adverse events was similar between placebo and active-treatment groups.

(Biomet Inc, Warsaw, IN, USA) and the Global C.A.P. (DePuy Int, Warsaw, IN, USA) 
humeral head resurfacing implants (HHRIs).
METHODS: The study randomly allocated 32 patients (13 women), mean age 63 years 
(range, 39-82 years), with shoulder osteoarthritis to a Copeland (n = 14) or 
Global C.A.P. (n = 18) HHRI. Patients were monitored for 2 years with 
radiostereometry, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, Constant Shoulder Score

was measured preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively.
RESULTS: At 2 years, total translation (TT) was 0.48 mm (standard deviation 
[SD], 0.21 mm) for the Copeland and 0.82 mm (SD, 0.46 mm) for the Global C.A.P.

(P = .02) than TT of 0.22 mm (SD, 0.17 mm) in nonrevised HHRI. A comparison of 
TT at the last follow-up (revision or 2 years) found no difference between the 
HHRIs (P = .12). Periprosthetic BMD decreased initially but increased 
continuously after 6 months for both HHRIs. At 2 years, BMD was 48% higher

significantly higher for the Copeland than for the Global C.A.P. HHRI (P = .02).

Prospective, randomized, double-blind study.","Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy",  Other,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"PURPOSE: Although the analgesic effect of periarticular injection after total 
knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been well documented, the gold standard for drug 
combination has not yet been established. In this study, the analgesic effects 
of six different drug combinations were compared.
METHODS: A total of 256 patients undergoing TKA for primary osteoarthritis were 
randomized into one of six groups: a control group (saline solution, 
epinephrine, and cefazolin, n = 42), Group 1 (ropivacaine, n = 43), Group 2 
(ropivacaine + morphine, n = 43), Group 3 (ropivacaine + ketorolac, n = 42), 
Group 4 (ropivacaine + morphine + ketorolac, n = 43), and Group 5 (ropivacaine + 
morphine + ketorolac + methylprednisolone, n = 43). Pain level assessed by 
visual analogue scale (VAS) and opioid consumption were primary outcomes. The 
incidence of complications, range of motion (ROM), C-reactive protein (CRP) 
value, and the amount of post-operative blood drainage were also compared.
RESULTS: Patients in Groups 4 and 5 complained less pain than the control group 
for the first 12 h after surgery, and the patients in the other groups showed 
less pain only during the initial 6 h after surgery. Groups 4 and 5 also showed 
less opioid consumption than the control group during the 24 h period after 
surgery. Patients in Group 5 showed no significant difference in VAS score and 
opioid consumption compared with Group 4, but they had lower CRP value and 
greater ROM than any other groups at post-operative day 2 and day 4.
CONCLUSION: Group 4 (ropivacaine + morphine + ketorolac) was not more effective 
on pain level and opioid consumption than Group 5 (ropivacaine + morphine + 
ketorolac + methylprednisolone) in patients undergoing TKA for primary

Prospective, randomized, double-blind study.","Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy",  Other,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"PURPOSE: Although the analgesic effect of periarticular injection after total 
knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been well documented, the gold standard for drug 
combination has not yet been established. In this study, the analgesic effects 
of six different drug combinations were compared.
METHODS: A total of 256 patients undergoing TKA for primary osteoarthritis were 
randomized into one of six groups: a control group (saline solution, 
epinephrine, and cefazolin, n = 42), Group 1 (ropivacaine, n = 43), Group 2 
(ropivacaine + morphine, n = 43), Group 3 (ropivacaine + ketorolac, n = 42), 
Group 4 (ropivacaine + morphine + ketorolac, n = 43), and Group 5 (ropivacaine + 
morphine + ketorolac + methylprednisolone, n = 43). Pain level assessed by 
visual analogue scale (VAS) and opioid consumption were primary outcomes. The 
incidence of complications, range of motion (ROM), C-reactive protein (CRP) 
value, and the amount of post-operative blood drainage were also compared.
RESULTS: Patients in Groups 4 and 5 complained less pain than the control group 
for the first 12 h after surgery, and the patients in the other groups showed 
less pain only during the initial 6 h after surgery. Groups 4 and 5 also showed 
less opioid consumption than the control group during the 24 h period after 
surgery. Patients in Group 5 showed no significant difference in VAS score and 
opioid consumption compared with Group 4, but they had lower CRP value and 
greater ROM than any other groups at post-operative day 2 and day 4.
CONCLUSION: The combination of ropivacaine, morphine, and ketorolac showed a 
significantly stronger and sufficiently synergistic analgesic effect without 
adding methylprednisolone in periarticular injection after TKA. The clinical 
relevance of the study is that the combination of ropivacaine, morphine, and 
ketorolac can be a good option for periarticular injection following TKA in 
terms of synergistic analgesic effect and efficiency of drug combination.",no_spin,8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.4217976927757263, 'probability': 0.6558666825294495}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.9440444707870483, 'probability': 0.3890511393547058}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.5813389420509338, 'probability': 0.5591492056846619}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.2557028532028198, 'probability': 0.7743720412254333}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.6235387325286865, 'probability': 0.5360441207885742}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.4424481987953186, 'probability': 0.6424615979194641}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.28275465965270996, 'probability': 0.7537046670913696}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.6719585061073303, 'probability': 0.5107073783874512}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.3994597792625427, 'probability': 0.6706822514533997}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.37648075819015503, 'probability': 0.686272382736206}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -1.0131652355194092, 'probability': 0.3630679249763489}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.3289508521556854, 'probability': 0.7196784019470215}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.17752355337142944, 'probability': 0.8373412489891052}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.8888344168663025, 'probability': 0.4111346900463104}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.36368271708488464, 'probability': 0.6951116919517517}]"

ganglion block for the treatment of acute anterior headache in the emergency 
department (ED) using a novel noninvasive delivery device.
METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial 
evaluating bupivacaine anesthesia of the sphenopalatine ganglion for acute 
anterior or global-based headache. This study was completed in 2 large academic 
EDs. Bupivacaine or normal saline solution was delivered intranasally (0.3 mL 
per side) with the Tx360 device. Pain and nausea were measured at 0, 5, and 15 
minutes by a 100-mm visual analog scale. The primary endpoint was a 50% 
reduction in pain at 15 minutes. Telephone follow-up assessed 24-hour pain and 
nausea through a 0- to 10-point verbal scale and adverse effects.
RESULTS: The median reported baseline pain in the bupivacaine group was 80 mm 
(IQR 66 mm - 93 mm) and 78.5 mm (IQR 64 mm to 91.75 mm) in the normal saline 
solution group. A 50% reduction in pain was achieved in 48.8% of the bupivacaine 
group (20/41 patients) versus 41.3% in the normal saline solution group (19/46

the rotator cuff (RC) tear has not been well clarified.
PURPOSE: To compare the clinical results between patients who had distal 
clavicle resection (DCR) and those who did not during RC repair.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: From August 2008 to December 2009, a total of 56 consecutive patients 
(58 shoulders) were included. All patients had either a full-thickness or 
high-grade (>50%) RC tear, ACJ tenderness, arthritic change visible on plain 
radiographs, and a positive ACJ lidocaine injection test the day before surgery. 
Patients were randomized into 2 groups: DCR and RC repair (DCR+RCR group) and RC 
repair only (isolated RCR). Evaluation was performed preoperatively, at 6 months 
postoperatively, and at a final follow-up a minimum of 24 months postoperatively 
using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, the Constant 
shoulder score, range of motion examination, and pain visual analog scale (VAS).
RESULTS: After simple randomization, 26 shoulders were allocated in the DCR+RCR 
group, and 32 were placed in the isolated RCR group. Five shoulders in the 
DCR+RCR group and 6 in the isolated RCR group were excluded from analysis due to 
loss of follow-up. Therefore, the evaluation was performed for 21 shoulders in 
the DCR+RCR group and 26 shoulders in the isolated RCR group. The mean follow-up 
period was 44.2 months in the DCR+RCR group and 44.0 months in the isolated RCR 
group. There were no differences in age, sex, symptom duration, RC tear size, or 
preoperative ASES, Constant, and VAS scores between the 2 groups (P > .05). At 
final follow-up, the ASES, Constant, and VAS scores were significantly improved 
in both groups (P < .001). There were no differences in ASES, Constant, and VAS 
scores between the 2 groups at final follow-up (P > .05), and there was no

the rotator cuff (RC) tear has not been well clarified.
PURPOSE: To compare the clinical results between patients who had distal 
clavicle resection (DCR) and those who did not during RC repair.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: From August 2008 to December 2009, a total of 56 consecutive patients 
(58 shoulders) were included. All patients had either a full-thickness or 
high-grade (>50%) RC tear, ACJ tenderness, arthritic change visible on plain 
radiographs, and a positive ACJ lidocaine injection test the day before surgery. 
Patients were randomized into 2 groups: DCR and RC repair (DCR+RCR group) and RC 
repair only (isolated RCR). The primary outcome was the American Shoulder and 
Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score. Secondary outcomes included the Constant shoulder 
score, range of motion examination, and pain visual analog scale (VAS). 
Evaluation was performed preoperatively, at 6 months postoperatively, and at a 
final follow-up a minimum of 24 months postoperatively.
RESULTS: After simple randomization, 26 shoulders were allocated in the DCR+RCR 
group, and 32 were placed in the isolated RCR group. Five shoulders in the 
DCR+RCR group and 6 in the isolated RCR group were excluded from analysis due to 
loss of follow-up. Therefore, the evaluation was performed for 21 shoulders in 
the DCR+RCR group and 26 shoulders in the isolated RCR group. The mean follow-up 
period was 44.2 months in the DCR+RCR group and 44.0 months in the isolated RCR 
group. There were no differences in age, sex, symptom duration, RC tear size, or 
preoperative ASES, Constant, and VAS scores between the 2 groups (P > .05). At 
final follow-up, there were no differences in ASES, Constant, and VAS scores 
between the 2 groups (P > .05), and there was no difference in residual ACJ 
tenderness (7 in the DCR+RCR group and 5 in the isolated RCR group) between the 
2 groups (P = .270).
CONCLUSION: DCR was not more effective on the ASES score than isolated RCR in 
patients with symptomatic ACJ arthritis and RC tears.",spin,5,5,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.3090934455394745, 'probability': 0.7341122031211853}, {'token': 28782, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.4073432683944702, 'probability': 0.24479275941848755}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.5039489269256592, 'probability': 0.6041402816772461}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.24514681100845337, 'probability': 0.7825896143913269}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.7616686224937439, 'probability': 0.4668866991996765}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.366690456867218, 'probability': 0.6930240988731384}]",5,5,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.2804388105869293, 'probability': 0.7554520964622498}, {'token': 28782, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.5960850715637207, 'probability': 0.20268848538398743}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.42235586047172546, 'probability': 0.6555007696151733}]",5,5,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.29037123918533325, 'probability': 0.74798583984375}, {'token': 28782, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.7910683155059814, 'probability': 0.16678188741207123}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.3602890968322754, 'probability': 0.6974746584892273}]",5,5,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.17776888608932495, 'probability': 0.8371358513832092}, {'token': 28782, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.6166627407073975, 'probability': 0.19856023788452148}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.5502228140830994, 'probability': 0.5768212676048279}]"

Conclusions and relevance: Among patients with severe trauma and major bleeding, early administration of plasma, platelets, and red blood cells in a 1:1:1 ratio compared with a 1:1:2 ratio did not result in significant differences in mortality at 24 hours or at 30 days. However, more patients in the 1:1:1 group achieved hemostasis and fewer experienced death due to exsanguination by 24 hours. Even though there was an increased use of plasma and platelets transfused in the 1:1:1 group, no other safety differences were identified between the 2 groups.",no_spin,7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.2946825921535492, 'probability': 0.7447679042816162}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.1140666007995605, 'probability': 0.32822149991989136}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.4932215213775635, 'probability': 0.6106560230255127}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.22473987936973572, 'probability': 0.7987239360809326}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.6600199341773987, 'probability': 0.5168410539627075}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.3507792353630066, 'probability': 0.7041391730308533}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.25586920976638794, 'probability': 0.7742432355880737}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.9826464653015137, 'probability': 0.3743191659450531}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.3256531357765198, 'probability': 0.7220556139945984}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.36159005761146545, 'probability': 0.6965678930282593}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -1.1973581314086914, 'probability': 0.30199098587036133}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.36260873079299927, 'probability': 0.6958585977554321}]",7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.18084439635276794, 'probability': 0.8345651626586914}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.1323204040527344, 'probability': 0.3222845494747162}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.39079076051712036, 'probability': 0.6765216588973999}]"

Delayed initiation of neuroprotective agents has hindered earlier phase 3 trials of neuroprotective agents.

Methods: We randomly assigned patients with suspected stroke to receive either intravenous magnesium sulfate or placebo, beginning within 2 hours after symptom onset. A loading dose was initiated by paramedics before the patient arrived at the hospital, and a 24-hour maintenance infusion was started on the patient's arrival at the hospital. The primary outcome was the degree of disability at 90 days, as measured by scores on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater disability).

Results: Among the 1700 enrolled patients (857 in the magnesium group and 843 in the placebo group), the mean (±SD) age was 69±13 years, 42.6% were women, and the mean pretreatment score on the Los Angeles Motor Scale of stroke severity (range, 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater motor deficits) was 3.7±1.3.

To increase the likelihood that good alignment will be achieved during surgery, smart tools such as robotics or patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) have been introduced.
Questions/purposes:В We hypothesized that UKA performed with PSI would result in improved level gait as ascertained with three-dimensional analysis, implant positioning, and patient-reported outcomes measured by a validated scoring system when compared with conventional instrumentation 3 months and 1 year after surgery.
Methods:В We randomized 60 patients into two groups using either the PSI technique or a conventional technique. All patients were operated on using the same technique and the same cemented metal-backed implant. Mean age of the patients was 63 В± 4 years (range, 54-72 years) and mean body mass index was 28 В± 3 kg/m(2). Patients were evaluated preoperatively, at 3 months, and 1 year after surgery by an independent observer blind to the type of technique. Gait parameters were assessed with three-dimensional analysis during level walking preoperatively and at 1 year, frontal and sagittal position of the implant was evaluated on full-length radiographs at 3 months, and subjective functional outcome and quality of life using routine questionnaires (SF-12, new Knee Society Score [KSS], Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) at 3 months and 1 year. This study had 80% power to detect a 15% difference in walking speed at the p < 0.05 level.
Results:В One year after surgery, there were no differences between the two groups in the analyzed gait spatiotemporal parameters, respectively, for PSI UKA and conventional UKA : double limb support 31% (25%-54%) versus 30% (23%-56%; p = 0.67) and walking speed (1.59 m/s [0.86-1.87 m/s] versus 1.57 m/s [0.71-1.96 m/s]; p = 0.41). No difference was observed between the two groups in terms of lower limb alignment (PSI group 178В° В± 3В°, conventional group 178В° В± 4В°; p = 0.24) or implant positioning on mediolateral and anteroposterior radiographs. There were no differences in the functional score between the PSI and conventional TKA groups at 3 months and 1 year after surgery: KSS objective knee scores (PSI: 85 В± 8 points at 3 months, 87 В± 5 points at 1 year and conventional instrumentation: 82 В± 8 points at 3 months 83 В± 6 points at 1 year; p = 0.10) and functional activity scores were similar in both group (PSI: 71 В± 12 points at 3 months and 74 В± 7 points at 1 year versus conventional group: 73 В± 11 points at 3 months and 75 В± 6 at 1 year; p = 0.9).

patients with varus malalignment and medial compartment osteoarthritis. There is 
no standardised protocol for post-operative rehabilitation available. The 
purpose of this study was to compare two post-operative rehabilitation protocols 
after open wedge HTO.
METHODS: One hundred and twenty consecutive patients with varus malalignment and 
medial compartment osteoarthritis received an open wedge HTO using an angular 
locking plate fixation between December 2008 and December 2011. All patients 
were assigned randomly into one of two groups with different post-operative 
rehabilitation protocols (11-day vs. 6-week 20-kg partial weight-bearing). 
Clinical outcome was evaluated using established instruments (Lequesne, Lysholm, 
HSS and IKDC scores) preoperatively, 6, 12 and 18 months post-operatively. 
Deformity analysis was performed preoperatively and during follow-up.
RESULTS: All clinical scores showed a significant pre- to post-operative 
improvement. After 6 months, there was a higher improvement in the group of 
early full weight-bearing. The difference between preoperative and 6-month 
follow-up for the group with early full weight-bearing and for the group with 
20-kg PWB for 6 weeks was 28 ± 26 and 18 ± 22, respectively, for the Lysholm 
score and -5.0 ± 5.1 and -3.0 ± 3.6, respectively, for the Lequesne score.
CONCLUSIONS: The study did not establish a clear primary outcome measure to

patients with varus malalignment and medial compartment osteoarthritis. There is 
no standardised protocol for post-operative rehabilitation available. The 
purpose of this study was to compare two post-operative rehabilitation protocols 
and to evaluate the clinical outcome of early full weight-bearing after open 
wedge HTO.
METHODS: One hundred and twenty consecutive patients with varus malalignment and 
medial compartment osteoarthritis received an open wedge HTO using an angular 
locking plate fixation between December 2008 and December 2011. All patients 
were assigned randomly into one of two groups with different post-operative 
rehabilitation protocols (11-day vs. 6-week 20-kg partial weight-bearing). 
Clinical outcome was evaluated using established instruments (Lequesne, Lysholm, 
HSS and IKDC scores) preoperatively, 6, 12 and 18В months post-operatively. 
Deformity analysis was performed preoperatively and during follow-up.
RESULTS: All clinical scores showed a significant pre- to post-operative 
improvement. After 6В months, there was a higher improvement in the group of 
early full weight-bearing. The difference between preoperative and 6-month 
follow-up for the group with early full weight-bearing and for the group with 
20-kg PWB for 6В weeks was 28В В±В 26 and 18В В±В 22, respectively, for the Lysholm 
score and -5.0В В±В 5.1 and -3.0В В±В 3.6, respectively, for the Lequesne score.
CONCLUSIONS: Early full weight-bearing (11-day 20-kg partial weight-bearing) 
after open wedge HTO without bone graft leads to earlier improvement of the 
clinical results and can be recommended for post-operative rehabilitation after 
open wedge HTO and fixation with an angular locking plate.",no_spin,8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.32811033725738525, 'probability': 0.7202834486961365}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.5865433216094971, 'probability': 0.5562467575073242}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.4889204502105713, 'probability': 0.613288164138794}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.24827894568443298, 'probability': 0.7801423072814941}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.6265596151351929, 'probability': 0.534427285194397}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.3879581093788147, 'probability': 0.6784408092498779}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.2988855540752411, 'probability': 0.7416443228721619}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.585418701171875, 'probability': 0.5568726658821106}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.4003441333770752, 'probability': 0.6700894236564636}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.38257068395614624, 'probability': 0.6821057200431824}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.8170290589332581, 'probability': 0.44174209237098694}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.3616184592247009, 'probability': 0.6965481042861938}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.19629262387752533, 'probability': 0.8217716813087463}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.6888728141784668, 'probability': 0.5021417737007141}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.39151066541671753, 'probability': 0.6760348677635193}]"

with neuroleptic antiemetics like metoclopramide. Haloperidol has been shown to 
be effective for migraine treatment.
STUDY OBJECTIVE: Our study compared the use of metoclopramide vs. haloperidol to 
treat ED migraine patients.
METHODS: A prospective, double-blinded, randomized control trial of 64 adults 
aged 18-50 years with migraine headache and no recognized risks for 
QT-prolongation. Haloperidol 5 mg or metoclopramide 10 mg was given 
intravenously after 25 mg diphenhydramine. Pain, nausea, restlessness 
(akathisia), and sedation were assessed with 100-mm visual analog scales (VAS) 
at baseline and every 20 min, to a maximum of 80 min. The primary outcome was 
pain relief. The need for rescue medications, side effects, and subject 
satisfaction were recorded. QTc intervals were measured prior to and after 
treatment. Follow-up calls after 48 h assessed satisfaction and recurrent or 
persistent symptoms.
RESULTS: Thirty-one subjects received haloperidol, 33 metoclopramide. The groups 
were similar on all VAS measurements, side effects, and in their satisfaction 
with therapy. Pain relief averaged 53 mm VAS over both groups, with equal times 
to maximum improvement. Subjects receiving haloperidol required rescue 
medication less often (3% vs. 24%, p < 0.02). Mean QTcs were equal

follow-up, 90% of subjects contacted were ""happy with the medication"" they had 
received, with haloperidol-treated subjects experiencing more restlessness (43%

No pain score differences occurred between study and control patients: Day 1: 4.5/4.6 (P=0.73); Day 2: 4.4/4.8 (P=0.27); or Day 3: 3.5/3.7 (P=0.58). Narcotic use was similar during hospitalization, 51.8/54.2 (P=0.34). The study medication costs $285, and the control medication costs $2.80.

placebo as medical expulsive therapy in patients with distal ureteric stones 
less than or equal to 10 mm in diameter.
METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter 
trial of adult participants with calculus on computed tomography (CT). Patients 
were allocated to 0.4 mg of tamsulosin or placebo daily for 28 days. The primary 
outcomes were stone expulsion on CT at 28 days and time to stone expulsion. 
Secondary outcomes included urologic interventions, time to self-reported stone 
passage, pain, and analgesia requirements.
RESULTS: There were 403 patients randomized, 81.4% were men, and the median age 
was 46 years. The median stone size was 4.0 mm in the tamsulosin group and 3.7 
mm in the placebo group. Of 316 patients who received CT at 28 days, stone 
passage occurred in 140 of 161 (87.0%) in the tamsulosin group and 127 of 155 
(81.9%) with placebo, a difference of 5.0% (95% confidence interval -3.0% to

placebo as medical expulsive therapy in patients with distal ureteric stones 
less than or equal to 10 mm in diameter.
METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter 
trial of adult participants with calculus on computed tomography (CT). Patients 
were allocated to 0.4 mg of tamsulosin or placebo daily for 28 days. The primary 
outcomes were stone expulsion on CT at 28 days and time to stone expulsion.
RESULTS: There were 403 patients randomized, 81.4% were men, and the median age 
was 46 years. The median stone size was 4.0 mm in the tamsulosin group and 3.7 
mm in the placebo group. Of 316 patients who received CT at 28 days, stone 
passage occurred in 140 of 161 (87.0%) in the tamsulosin group and 127 of 155 
(81.9%) with placebo, a difference of 5.0% (95% confidence interval -3.0% to 
13.0%). In a prespecified subgroup analysis of large stones (5 to 10 mm), 30 of 
36 (83.3%) tamsulosin participants had stone passage compared with 25 of 41 
(61.0%) with placebo, a difference of 22.4% (95% confidence interval 3.1% to 
41.6%) and number needed to treat of 4.5. There was no difference in urologic 
interventions, time to self-reported stone passage, pain, or analgesia 
requirements. Adverse events were generally mild and did not differ between 
groups.
CONCLUSION: We found no benefit overall of 0.4 mg of tamsulosin daily for 
patients with distal ureteric calculi less than or equal to 10 mm in terms of 
spontaneous passage, time to stone passage, pain, or analgesia requirements. In 
the subgroup with large stones (5 to 10 mm), tamsulosin did increase passage and

of intra-articular hip disorders. While most arthroscopic hip procedures are 
performed as outpatient surgeries, patients can still experience significant 
postoperative pain and opioid-associated side effects.
PURPOSE: The potential benefits of a preoperative femoral nerve block (FNB) in 
hip arthroscopy were explored in a previous retrospective review. The study 
objective was to confirm these findings in a prospective randomized study.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: Fifty patients undergoing hip arthroscopy were included in this 
prospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial that was patient-, 
operator-, and assessor-blinded. Patients received either a preoperative 
ultrasound-guided FNB with 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine (FNB group) or normal 
saline (control group). Nerve blockade was confirmed via standardized sensory 
testing before the induction of general anesthesia. The primary endpoint was 
cumulative consumption of oral morphine equivalent at 24 hours after discharge. 
Secondary endpoints included opioid use at various time points, pain scores, 
Quality of Recovery (QoR-27) score, incidence of nausea and vomiting, time to 
discharge, block-related complications, falls at 24 hours, and patient 
satisfaction.
RESULTS: Fifty patients completed the study, including 27 in the FNB group and 
23 in the control group. Most patient characteristics were statistically similar 
between groups except for operative time, which was longer in the control group. 
Cumulative oral morphine consumption was lower in the FNB group at 48 hours; 
there was no difference at 24 hours or 7 days postoperatively. Pain scores were 
significantly lower up to 6 hours postoperatively in the FNB group compared with 
control; however, rebound pain was observed at 24 hours after discharge in 
patients who received FNB. There was no difference in most secondary outcomes. 
Importantly, a total of 6 patients in the FNB group reported falls (without 
injury) within the first 24 hours postoperatively compared with none in the 
control group. Patient satisfaction with pain control was high in both groups at 
all time points.
CONCLUSION: Preoperative FNB may improve early pain control after hip

of intra-articular hip disorders. While most arthroscopic hip procedures are 
performed as outpatient surgeries, patients can still experience significant 
postoperative pain and opioid-associated side effects.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of preoperative femoral nerve block (FNB) compared to placebo in patients undergoing hip arthroscopy.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: Fifty patients undergoing hip arthroscopy were included in this 
prospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial that was patient-, 
operator-, and assessor-blinded. Patients received either a preoperative 
ultrasound-guided FNB with 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine (FNB group) or normal 
saline (control group). Nerve blockade was confirmed via standardized sensory 
testing before the induction of general anesthesia. The primary endpoint was 
cumulative consumption of oral morphine equivalent at 24 hours after discharge. 
Secondary endpoints included opioid use at various time points, pain scores, 
Quality of Recovery (QoR-27) score, incidence of nausea and vomiting, time to 
discharge, block-related complications, falls at 24 hours, and patient 
satisfaction.
RESULTS: Fifty patients completed the study, including 27 in the FNB group and 
23 in the control group. Most patient characteristics were statistically similar 
between groups except for operative time, which was longer in the control group. 
There was no difference in cumulative oral morphine consumption at 24 hours between groups. Cumulative oral morphine consumption was lower in the FNB group at 48 hours; 
there was no difference at 7 days postoperatively. Pain scores were 
significantly lower up to 6 hours postoperatively in the FNB group compared with 
control; however, rebound pain was observed at 24 hours after discharge in 
patients who received FNB. There was no difference in most secondary outcomes. 
A total of 6 patients in the FNB group reported falls (without 
injury) within the first 24 hours postoperatively compared with none in the 
control group. Patient satisfaction with pain control was high in both groups at 
all time points.
CONCLUSION: Preoperative FNB was not more effective than placebo on cumulative oral morphine consumption at 24 hours in patients undergoing hip arthroscopy.",spin,5,5,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.26193442940711975, 'probability': 0.7695614099502563}, {'token': 28782, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.3678728342056274, 'probability': 0.2546480596065521}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.5684033036231995, 'probability': 0.5664291381835938}]",7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.1935751736164093, 'probability': 0.8240078687667847}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.0600488185882568, 'probability': 0.3464389145374298}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.29403170943260193, 'probability': 0.7452528476715088}]",5,5,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.2743431627750397, 'probability': 0.7600711584091187}, {'token': 28782, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.4015536308288574, 'probability': 0.2462141364812851}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.47790950536727905, 'probability': 0.6200782656669617}]",7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.30760714411735535, 'probability': 0.7352040410041809}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.6738593578338623, 'probability': 0.18752193450927734}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.3143925666809082, 'probability': 0.730232298374176}]",6,6,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.18871724605560303, 'probability': 0.8280205726623535}, {'token': 28784, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.5144957304000854, 'probability': 0.21991904079914093}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.37686648964881897, 'probability': 0.6860076189041138}]"

However, there are few well-designed studies comparing approaches to treatment.

Questions/purposes: (1) Which treatment (compression bandaging with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], aspiration, or aspiration with steroid injections) is associated with the highest likelihood of resolution of nonseptic olecranon bursitis? (2) Which treatment is associated with earliest resolution of symptoms? (3) What factors are associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks?

Methods: We enrolled 133 patients from two centers; after applying prespecified exclusions (septic bursitis or concomitant inflammatory arthritis, intraarticular elbow pathology, recent aspiration or steroid injection done elsewhere, and refusal to participate), 90 patients were randomly allocated to receive compression bandaging with NSAIDs (C), aspiration (A), or aspiration with steroid injection (AS) groups (30 patients in each). The groups were similar at baseline in terms of age and gender. Seven patients (four from Group A and three from Group AS) were lost to followup. All patients were followed up weekly for 4 weeks, and the same treatment procedure was repeated if the bursitis recurred with any substantial fluid collection. At 4 weeks, the state of resolution and pain visual analog scale (VAS) were evaluated. Failed resolution was defined as presence of persistent olecranon bursal fluid collection at Week 4 after the initiation of the treatment; on the contrary, if bursal fluid collection was clinically reduced or completely disappeared by the end of Week 4, the treatment was considered successful. We compared the proportion of resolution by Week 4 and the median times to resolution among the treatment groups. In addition, we evaluated whether the resolution affected pain VAS and what factors were associated with the resolution.

Results: There were no differences in the proportion of patients whose bursitis resolved by Week 4 among the three treatment groups (Group C: 25 of 30 [83%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.27-1.72], p = 0.580; Group A: 17 of 26 [65%], relative risk of resolution failure: 2.19 [95% CI, 0.98-4.87], p = 0.083; Group AS: 23 of 27 [85%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.59 [95% CI, 0.22-1.63], p = 0.398) (p = 0.073). Steroid injection after aspiration (Group AS) was associated with the earliest resolution (2.3 weeks [range, 1-4 weeks]) when compared with aspiration alone (Group A; 3.1 weeks [range, 2-4 weeks]) and compression bandaging with NSAIDs (Group C; 3.2 weeks [range, 2-4 weeks]), p = 0.015). Longer duration of symptoms before treatment was the only factor associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks (failed resolution: 6 weeks [range, 2-9 weeks]; successful resolution: 4 weeks [range, 0.4-6 weeks]; p = 0.008).

Conclusions: With the numbers available, there were no differences in efficacy when compression bandaging with NSAIDs, aspiration, and aspiration with steroid injection were compared. However, we were powered only to detect a 30% difference, meaning that if there were a smaller difference in efficacy among the groups, we might not have detected it in a study of this size. Our data can be used as pilot data to power future prospective (and likely multicenter) trials. Because olecranon bursitis can recur, and because treatments like aspiration and aspiration with steroid injection can cause complications, unless future trials demonstrate clear efficacy advantages of aspiration and/or injection both at short and longer terms, we suggest that compression bandaging and a short course of NSAIDs may offer the most appropriate balance of safety and efficacy.",no_spin,7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.6054458022117615, 'probability': 0.545831024646759}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.214339017868042, 'probability': 0.2969062030315399}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.4604117274284363, 'probability': 0.6310237646102905}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.5088335275650024, 'probability': 0.6011964082717896}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.6606442332267761, 'probability': 0.5165184140205383}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.5005648136138916, 'probability': 0.606188178062439}]",7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.5215861201286316, 'probability': 0.5935783386230469}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -0.9832471609115601, 'probability': 0.3740943968296051}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.4166022539138794, 'probability': 0.6592831015586853}]",7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.787348210811615, 'probability': 0.45504990220069885}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.361675500869751, 'probability': 0.2562310993671417}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.26847371459007263, 'probability': 0.7645455002784729}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.36495885252952576, 'probability': 0.6942251920700073}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.9935033321380615, 'probability': 0.37027719616889954}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.5648220181465149, 'probability': 0.5684613585472107}]"

Results: There were no differences in the proportion of patients whose bursitis resolved by Week 4 among the three treatment groups (Group C: 25 of 30 [83%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.27-1.72], p = 0.580; Group A: 17 of 26 [65%], relative risk of resolution failure: 2.19 [95% CI, 0.98-4.87], p = 0.083; Group AS: 23 of 27 [85%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.59 [95% CI, 0.22-1.63], p = 0.398) (p = 0.073). Time to resolution was 2.3 weeks (range, 1-4 weeks) for Group AS, 3.1 weeks (range, 2-4 weeks) for Group A, and 3.2 weeks (range, 2-4 weeks) for Group C (p = 0.015). Longer duration of symptoms before treatment was associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks (failed resolution: 6 weeks [range, 2-9 weeks]; successful resolution: 4 weeks [range, 0.4-6 weeks]; p = 0.008).

Conclusions: Compression bandaging with NSAIDs was not more effective than aspiration or aspiration with steroid injection in patients with nonseptic olecranon bursitis for the primary outcome of resolution by 4 weeks.",spin,5,5,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.3212191164493561, 'probability': 0.725264310836792}, {'token': 28782, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.2767696380615234, 'probability': 0.27893689274787903}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.5612200498580933, 'probability': 0.570512592792511}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.35456204414367676, 'probability': 0.7014805674552917}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.7928075790405273, 'probability': 0.45257237553596497}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.31758880615234375, 'probability': 0.7279019951820374}]",7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.3927423655986786, 'probability': 0.6752027273178101}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.152417540550232, 'probability': 0.3158722221851349}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.2531217038631439, 'probability': 0.7763733863830566}]",7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.5388253927230835, 'probability': 0.5834331512451172}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.5452643632888794, 'probability': 0.21325547993183136}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.18185389041900635, 'probability': 0.8337231874465942}]",7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.22844572365283966, 'probability': 0.795769453048706}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.2580164670944214, 'probability': 0.2842172384262085}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.3334599435329437, 'probability': 0.7164406180381775}]"

Our hypothesis was that there would be no differences in joint line angles or correction accuracy between the two groups, that patellar height would increase after CW HTO and decrease after OW HTO, and that leg length and posterior tibial slope would decrease after CW HTO and increase after OW HTO.

Methods: Radiological data were collected from 70 patients participating in an ongoing prospective randomized clinical trial comparing OW and CW HTOs. Digital standing hip-knee-ankle (HKA) radiographs as well as lateral radiographs in 30Ў of flexion were obtained preoperatively and at 6 months for each patient. Joint line angles, HKA angle, leg length, Insall-Salvati index, Miura-Kawamura index and posterior tibial slope were measured using medical planning software. The complete preoperative radiological examinations of the first 50 patients were used in a study of intra- and inter-rater reliability of the measurements.

Results: The mean posterior slope was reduced by 2.5Ў in CW HTO, whereas it remained unchanged in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Mean leg length decreased 5.7 mm in CW HTO and increased 3.1 mm in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Changes in joint line angles, patellar height indexes and the correction accuracy showed no significant differences comparing the two techniques. Frontal plane reliability measurement intra- and inter-rater intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) varied from 0.81 to 0.99. Sagittal plane intra- and inter-rater ICC varied from 0.60 to 0.87. Posterior tibial slope intra- and inter-rater ICC showed the lowest values (0.70 and 0.60, respectively) corresponding to a smallest real difference of 4.5Ў and 5.5Ў, respectively.

Conclusions: Posterior tibial slope and leg length changes were significantly different in CW compared to OW HTOs. We recommend that possible alterations in tibial slope and leg length are considered when the technique of HTO is to be chosen. Landmark-based medical planning software shows good reliability and can be used in preoperative planning and postoperative evaluations of HTOs.",no_spin,7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.4360787868499756, 'probability': 0.6465668082237244}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.1835871934890747, 'probability': 0.3061784505844116}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.45075419545173645, 'probability': 0.6371474862098694}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.25043460726737976, 'probability': 0.7784623503684998}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.6070592403411865, 'probability': 0.5449510812759399}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.4058266580104828, 'probability': 0.6664257049560547}]",7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.3511614203453064, 'probability': 0.7038701176643372}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.0149234533309937, 'probability': 0.3624301552772522}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.3851558566093445, 'probability': 0.6803446412086487}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.40377146005630493, 'probability': 0.6677967309951782}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -1.2404913902282715, 'probability': 0.28924205899238586}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.3359273672103882, 'probability': 0.7146749496459961}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.20938953757286072, 'probability': 0.8110792636871338}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -1.131248116493225, 'probability': 0.3226303160190582}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.41535601019859314, 'probability': 0.6601052284240723}]"

41,26475246,"Emergency Department Management of Sepsis Patients: A Randomized, Goal-Oriented, Noninvasive Sepsis Trial.",Annals of Emergency Medicine,RESULTS: Focus on (+) subgroup analysis,,Emergency Medicine,claude_4.0-sonnet,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The noninvasive cardiac output monitor and passive leg-raising 
maneuver has been shown to be reasonably accurate in predicting fluid 
responsiveness in critically ill patients. We examine whether using a 
noninvasive protocol would result in more rapid lactate clearance after 3 hours 
in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock in the emergency department.
METHODS: In this open-label randomized controlled trial, 122 adult patients with 
sepsis and serum lactate concentration of greater than or equal to 3.0 mmol/L 
were randomized to receive usual care or intravenous fluid bolus administration 
guided by measurements of change of stroke volume index, using the noninvasive 
cardiac output monitor after passive leg-raising maneuver. The primary outcome 
was lactate clearance of more than 20% at 3 hours. Secondary outcomes included 
mortality, length of hospital and ICU stay, and total hospital cost. Analysis 
was intention to treat.
RESULTS: Similar proportions of patients in the randomized intervention group 
(70.5%; N=61) versus control group (73.8%; N=61) achieved the primary outcome, 
with a relative risk of 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77 to 1.19). 
Secondary outcomes were similar in both groups (P>.05 for all comparisons). 
Hospital mortality occurred in 6 patients (9.8%) each in the intervention and 
control groups on or before 28 days (relative risk=1.00; 95% CI 0.34 to 2.93).

maneuver has been shown to be reasonably accurate in predicting fluid 
responsiveness in critically ill patients. We examine whether using a 
noninvasive protocol would result in more rapid lactate clearance after 3 hours 
in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock in the emergency department.
METHODS: In this open-label randomized controlled trial, 122 adult patients with 
sepsis and serum lactate concentration of greater than or equal to 3.0 mmol/L 
were randomized to receive usual care or intravenous fluid bolus administration 
guided by measurements of change of stroke volume index, using the noninvasive 
cardiac output monitor after passiveВ leg-raising maneuver. The primary outcome 
was lactate clearance of more than 20% at 3 hours. Secondary outcomes included 
mortality, length of hospital and ICU stay, and total hospital cost. Analysis 
was intention to treat.
RESULTS: Similar proportions of patients in the randomized intervention group 
(70.5%; N=61) versus control group (73.8%; N=61) achieved the primary outcome, 
with a relative risk of 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77 to 1.19). 
Secondary outcomes were similar in both groups (P>.05 for all comparisons). 
Hospital mortality occurred in 6 patients (9.8%) each in the intervention and 
control groups on or before 28 days (relative risk=1.00; 95% CI 0.34 to 2.93). 
Among a subgroup of patients with underlying fluid overload states, those in the 
intervention group tended to receive clinically significantly more intravenous 
fluids at 3 hours (difference=975 mL; 95% CI -450 to 1,725 mL) and attained 
better lactate clearance (difference=19.7%; 95% CI -34.6% to 60.2%) compared 
with the control group, with shorter hospital lengths of stay (difference=-4.5 
days; 95% CI -9.5 to 2.5 days).
CONCLUSION: Protocol-based fluid resuscitation of patients with severe sepsis 
and septic shock with the noninvasive cardiac output monitor and passive 
leg-raising maneuver did not result in better outcomes compared with usual care. 
Future studies to demonstrate the use of the noninvasive protocol-based care in 
patients with preexisting fluid overload states may be warranted.",no_spin,5,5,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.336057186126709, 'probability': 0.7145822048187256}, {'token': 28782, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.2202951908111572, 'probability': 0.2951430380344391}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.5439137816429138, 'probability': 0.5804719924926758}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.2409934252500534, 'probability': 0.7858468294143677}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.8878272175788879, 'probability': 0.41154900193214417}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.3833935558795929, 'probability': 0.6815446019172668}]",6,6,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.34271296858787537, 'probability': 0.7098418474197388}, {'token': 28784, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.4645675420761108, 'probability': 0.23117795586585999}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.3046136796474457, 'probability': 0.7374081611633301}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.31005343794822693, 'probability': 0.733407735824585}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -1.517562985420227, 'probability': 0.2192455381155014}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.3810543417930603, 'probability': 0.683140754699707}]",7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.20830217003822327, 'probability': 0.8119617104530334}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.3429350852966309, 'probability': 0.26107823848724365}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.46390196681022644, 'probability': 0.6288251876831055}]"

Objective: To test the hypothesis that high-intensity endurance training (ET) is superior to moderate-intensity ET for improving risk factors for type 2 diabetes in overweight adolescents.

arthroplasty (TJA) is a high priority and is partly linked to the efficacy of 
surgical site preparation solutions (SPSs) in reducing the number of pathogens 
on the skin before incision. The aim of this study is to investigate the 
effectiveness of SRS reapplication after draping to reduce the incidence of SSI 
after TJA.
METHODS: Six hundred patients undergoing primary TJA between 2010 and 2011 at a 
single institution were recruited and randomly assigned to one of 2 groups. The 
patients in the intervention group (nВ = 300) received SPS that included alcohol 
and povidone-iodine before draping and an additional SPS by iodine povacrylex 
and isopropyl alcohol before application of the final adhesive drape, whereas 
the patients in the control group (nВ = 300) received a single SPS with alcohol 
and povidone-iodine before draping. Randomization was performed by an opaque 
envelope, and the rates of SSI and blistering were compared between groups.
RESULTS: Five seventy-seven patients completed the study and were included in 
the final analysis. There was a significant reduction in the incidence of 
superficial SSI for the intervention group (1.8%, 5 of 283) compared to the 
control group (6.5%, 19 of 294, PВ = .02). There were 2 (0.7%, 2 of 294) deep 
incisional SSIs in the control group, and 2 (0.7%, 2 of 283) organ-space SSIs in 
the intervention group (PВ = 1.00). In addition, skin blistering was lower in the 
intervention group (3.5%, 10 of 283) vs the control group (6.5%, 19 of 294), but 
this difference also did not reach statistical significance (PВ = .13).

arthroplasty (TJA) is a high priority and is partly linked to the efficacy of 
surgical site preparation solutions (SPSs) in reducing the number of pathogens 
on the skin before incision. The aim of this study is to investigate the 
effectiveness of SPS reapplication after draping to reduce the incidence of SSI 
after TJA.
METHODS: Six hundred patients undergoing primary TJA between 2010 and 2011 at a 
single institution were recruited and randomly assigned to one of 2 groups. The 
patients in the intervention group (n = 300) received SPS that included alcohol 
and povidone-iodine before draping and an additional SPS by iodine povacrylex 
and isopropyl alcohol before application of the final adhesive drape, whereas 
the patients in the control group (n = 300) received a single SPS with alcohol 
and povidone-iodine before draping. Randomization was performed by an opaque 
envelope, and the rates of SSI and blistering were compared between groups. The 
primary outcome was overall SSI rate.
RESULTS: Five seventy-seven patients completed the study and were included in 
the final analysis. Overall SSI occurred in 9 of 283 patients (3.2%) in the 
intervention group compared to 21 of 294 patients (7.1%) in the control group 
(P = .06). Superficial SSI occurred in 5 of 283 patients (1.8%) in the 
intervention group compared to 19 of 294 patients (6.5%) in the control group 
(P = .02). There were 2 (0.7%) deep incisional SSIs in the control group, and 2 
(0.7%) organ-space SSIs in the intervention group (P = 1.00). Skin blistering 
occurred in 10 of 283 patients (3.5%) in the intervention group versus 19 of 294 
patients (6.5%) in the control group (P = .13).

This study assessed the effect of a 6-week low-fat (LF) or portion control (PC) diet matched for weight loss on fat taste thresholds, fat perception, and preference in people with overweight/obesity.

Methods: Participants (n = 53) completed a randomized dietary intervention and consumed either a LF diet (25% fat) or PC diet (33% fat) for 6 weeks. Fat taste thresholds (lowest detectable fat concentration), fat perception (discrimination ability), preference, and anthropometry were assessed at baseline and week 6.

Results: Consumption of a LF diet (n = 26) and PC diet (n = 27) reduced participants' weight (P < 0.001), with no significant differences between groups (LF, -2.9%, PC, -2.7%).

This study assessed the effect of a 6-week low-fat (LF) or portion control (PC) diet matched for weight loss on fat taste thresholds, fat perception, and preference in people with overweight/obesity.

Methods: Participants (n = 53) completed a randomized dietary intervention and consumed either a LF diet (25% fat) or PC diet (33% fat) for 6 weeks. Fat taste thresholds (lowest detectable fat concentration), fat perception (discrimination ability), preference, and anthropometry were assessed at baseline and week 6.

Results: Consumption of a LF diet (n = 26) and PC diet (n = 27) reduced participants' weight (P < 0.001), with no significant differences between groups (LF, -2.9%, PC, -2.7%). Both diets resulted in a decrease in fat taste thresholds (P = 0.014), with no significant difference between the LF diet and PC diet (P = 0.060).

separate double-layer double-row repair for the treatment of delaminated rotator 
cuff tears.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled study; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: Between August 2007 and March 2014, a total of 82 patients who 
underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of a delaminated tear were enrolled 
and randomized into 2 groups. In group 1 (n = 48), arthroscopic conventional en 
masse repair was performed. In group 2 (n = 34), separate double-layer 
double-row repair was performed. The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, 
Constant score, Simple Shoulder Test score, visual analog scale (VAS) score 
for pain, and range of motion (ROM) were assessed before surgery; at 3, 6, and 12 
months after surgery; and at the last follow-up visit. Magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) was performed at 12 months postoperatively to examine the retear 
rate and pattern.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference between groups in the preoperative 
demographic data, including patient age, sex, symptom duration, tear size, and 
functional scores (P > .05). The mean follow-up period was 25.9 ± 1.2 months. 
No significant differences in functional scores and ROM were found between the 2 
groups at each time point. Group 2 had significantly lower VAS pain scores (P < 
.05) at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Eight (17%) of 48 patients in group 
1 and 6 (18%) of 34 patients in group 2 showed retears on MRI at 12-month 
follow-up (P > .05).
CONCLUSION: Separate double-layer double-row repair was not more effective than 
conventional en masse repair in patients with delaminated rotator cuff tears.",spin,5,5,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.32907095551490784, 'probability': 0.7195918560028076}, {'token': 28782, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.34708571434021, 'probability': 0.25999686121940613}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.5913020968437195, 'probability': 0.5536060333251953}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.23163458704948425, 'probability': 0.7932358980178833}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.8960492014884949, 'probability': 0.4081791341304779}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.4120521545410156, 'probability': 0.6622897386550903}]",6,6,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.291260302066803, 'probability': 0.7473210692405701}, {'token': 28784, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.4755213260650635, 'probability': 0.2286594957113266}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.3868320882320404, 'probability': 0.6792051196098328}]",7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.3381454646587372, 'probability': 0.7130915522575378}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.5629724264144897, 'probability': 0.2095123678445816}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.33702996373176575, 'probability': 0.7138874530792236}]",7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.2082890123128891, 'probability': 0.8119723796844482}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.410082221031189, 'probability': 0.24412322044372559}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.44456708431243896, 'probability': 0.6411017179489136}]"

superficial and deep layers. Owing to this characteristic, separate repair of 
delaminated rotator cuff tears has been introduced for the restoration of the 
physiological biomechanics of the rotator cuff. However, whether conventional en 
masse repair or separate repair is superior is controversial in terms of 
outcomes.
PURPOSE: To compare clinical outcomes between conventional en masse repair and 
separate double-layer double-row repair for the treatment of delaminated rotator 
cuff tears.

METHODS: One hundred twenty patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff 
repair with SLBC lesions (biceps partial tears <50%, partial pulley lesions, and 
type II SLAP lesions) were enrolled in this prospective comparative study and 
randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups (simple debridement [Deb], biceps 
tenotomy only [BTo], or biceps tenodesis with one suture anchor [BTd]). Patients 
with isolated subscapularis tears or osteoarthritis were excluded. Finally, 86 
patients (Deb in 28, BTo in 27, and BTd in 31) were analyzed (mean follow-up, 
22.1 ± 7.72 months; mean age, 58.98 ± 7.8 years). Pain; functional, clinical,

RESULTS: Pain, range of motion, and functional scores improved postoperatively 
in all 3 groups, with no significant differences across groups. At the 6-month 
follow-up, 8 patients reported cramping pain (5 Deb patients, 2 BTo patients,

Methods: In this study 194 adults with obesity were randomized to a 5.5-month program with or without mindfulness training and identical diet-exercise guidelines. Intention-to-treat analyses with multiple imputation were used for missing data. The primary outcome was 18-month weight change.

Results: Estimated effects comparing the mindfulness to control arm favored the mindfulness arm in (a) weight loss at 12 months, -1.9 kg (95% CI: -4.5, 0.8; P = 0.17), and 18 months, -1.7 kg (95% CI: -4.7, 1.2; P = 0.24), though not statistically significant; (b) changes in fasting glucose at 12 months, -3.1 mg/dl (95% CI: -6.3, 0.1; P = 0.06), and 18 months, -4.1 mg/dl (95% CI: -7.3, -0.9; P = 0.01); and (c) changes in triglyceride/HDL ratio at 12 months, -0.57 (95% CI: -0.95, -0.18; P = 0.004), and 18 months, -0.36 (95% CI: -0.74, 0.03; P = 0.07).

The aim of this study was to determine whether there are middle-term differences in knee function and pain in patients undergoing fixed- and mobile-bearing total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

Methods: Eligible patients were randomized into two groups: the first group received TKA implantation with a fixed tibial platform (group A); the second group received TKA with a mobile tibial platform (group B). Patients were followed up (2 years), and their symptoms and limitations in daily living activities were evaluated using the Knee Outcome Survey-Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADLS), in addition to pain evaluation assessed using the pain visual analogue scale (VAS).

Results: There were no significant differences in function and symptoms in the ADLS and VAS between the study groups.

Conclusion: The type of platform used in TKA (fixed vs. mobile) does not change the symptoms, function or pain of patients 2 years post-surgery.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination of intravenous (IV) and topical tranexamic acid (TXA) in revision THA.

Methods: Eighty-four consecutive patients undergoing revision THA were randomized into combined group and IV-TXA group. Patients in the combined group were given intravenously 15 mg/kg TXA as a preoperative, and topical TXA solution was applied at a concentration of 3 g TXA per 100-mL saline during the different procedure points. Patients in the IV-TXA group were given intravenously 15 mg/kg TXA alone.

Results: The mean total blood loss, drainage volume, and maximum hemoglobin drop were significantly lower in the combined group than the IV-TXA group (P < .001, P < .001, P < .001, respectively). Compared with the IV-TXA group, the amount of blood transfusions and number of blood transfusions required were decreased dramatically in the combined group (P = .027, P < .001, respectively). One deep vein thrombosis and 4 calf muscular vein thrombosis in the combined group and 3 calf muscular vein thrombosis in the IV-TXA were detected by the Doppler ultrasound.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination of intravenous (IV) and topical tranexamic acid (TXA) in revision THA.

Methods: Eighty-four consecutive patients undergoing revision THA were randomized into combined group and IV-TXA group. The primary outcome was total blood loss. Patients in the combined group were given intravenously 15 mg/kg TXA as a preoperative, and topical TXA solution was applied at a concentration of 3 g TXA per 100-mL saline during the different procedure points. Patients in the IV-TXA group were given intravenously 15 mg/kg TXA alone.

Results: The mean total blood loss was 1,247 mL in the combined group and 1,689 mL in the IV-TXA group (P < .001). The drainage volume and maximum hemoglobin drop were lower in the combined group than the IV-TXA group (P < .001, P < .001, respectively). The amount of blood transfusions and number of blood transfusions required were lower in the combined group compared with the IV-TXA group (P = .027, P < .001, respectively). One deep vein thrombosis and 4 calf muscular vein thrombosis in the combined group and 3 calf muscular vein thrombosis in the IV-TXA were detected by the Doppler ultrasound.

established as a standard treatment for large full-thickness cartilage defects, 
the effect of different doses of autologous chondrocyte products on structural 
outcomes has never been examined.
HYPOTHESIS: In ACI, the dose level may have an influence on medium-term magnetic 
resonance morphological findings after treatment.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: A total of 75 patients who underwent ACI using a pure, autologous, 
third-generation matrix-associated ACI product were divided into 3 groups 
representing different doses: 3 to 7 spheroids/cm(2), 10 to 30 spheroids/cm(2), 
and 40 to 70 spheroids/cm(2). Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 1.5, 
3, 6, and 12 months after ACI and was evaluated by the magnetic resonance 
observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score and the Knee injury and 
Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS).
RESULTS: MOCART scores showed improvements after 3 months, with slight dose 
dependence, and further improvement after 12 months, although without 
significant dose dependence. The mean MOCART scores after 3 months (0 = worst, 
100 = best) were 59.8, 64.5, and 64.7 for the low-, medium-, and high-dose 
groups, respectively, and 62.9 for all patients; at 12 months, these were 74.1, 
74.5, and 68.8 for the respective dose groups and 72.4 for all patients. Several 
MOCART items (surface of repair tissue, structure of repair tissue, signal 
intensity of repair tissue, subchondral bone, and synovitis) showed a more rapid 
response with the medium and high doses than with the low dose, suggesting a 
potential dose relationship. No significant correlation between the MOCART 
(overall and subscores) with clinical outcomes as assessed by the overall KOOS 
was detected at 3- and 12-month assessments.
CONCLUSION: This study reveals a trend toward earlier recovery after treatment 
with higher spheroid doses in terms of better defect filling for full-thickness 
cartilage defects of the knee, while outcomes after 12 months were similar in 
all dose groups. However, a correlation with clinical outcomes or the failure 
rate at 1 year after ACI was not found. A longer follow-up will be required for 
more definite conclusions on the clinical relevance of ACI cell density to be 
drawn.

patients is under debate.
PURPOSE: To compare clinical outcomes and calf muscle strength recovery after 
the nonsurgical treatment and open surgical repair of acute Achilles tendon 
ruptures with identical accelerated rehabilitation programs.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: From 2009 to 2013, a total of 60 patients with an acute Achilles tendon 
rupture were randomized to surgery or nonsurgical treatment. Nonsurgical 
treatment included first a week of cast immobilization, followed by a functional 
orthosis for 6 weeks, allowing full weightbearing after week 1 and active 
plantar flexion after week 5. Surgery was simple end-to-end open repair, and 
postoperative treatment was identical to nonsurgical treatment. The primary outcome 
was the Leppilahti Achilles tendon performance score. Secondary outcomes included 
isokinetic calf muscle strength and RAND 36-Item Health Survey at 18-month follow-up.
RESULTS: At 18-month follow-up, the mean Leppilahti score was 79.5 and 75.7 for 
the surgically and nonsurgically treated groups, respectively (mean difference, 
3.8; 95% CI, -1.9 to 9.5; P = .19). Angle-specific peak torque results of 
affected legs at 18 months showed a 14% difference in the peak torque of the 
affected leg favoring the surgical group versus the nonsurgical group (mean peak 
torque, 110.3 vs 96.5 N·m, respectively; mean difference, 13.6 N·m; 95% CI, 
2.0-25.1 N·m; P = .022). The RAND 36-Item Health Survey indicated differences 
in the domains of physical functioning (P = .006) and bodily pain (P = .037) 
for surgically treated patients.
CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment was not more effective than nonsurgical treatment 
on the Leppilahti Achilles tendon performance score in patients with acute 
Achilles tendon ruptures.

CONCLUSION: Surgical and nonsurgical treatments of acute Achilles tendon

surgery at 18 months. Surgery may also result in better health-related quality 
of life in the domains of physical functioning and bodily pain compared with 
nonsurgical treatment.

239,27339124,No Difference in Early Analgesia Between Liposomal Bupivacaine Injection and Intrathecal Morphine After TKA.,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,  Other,"""Trend toward significance"" // ""Numerically longer survival"" or equivalent verbiage",Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Background: Opioid analgesics have been a standard modality for postoperative pain management after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) but are also associated with increased risk of nausea, pruritus, vomiting, respiratory depression, prolonged ileus, and cognitive dysfunction. There is still a need for a method of anesthesia that can deliver effective long-term postoperative pain relief without incurring the high cost and health burden of opioids and nerve blocks.

Questions/purposes: (1) Is liposomal bupivacaine-based periarticular injection (PAI) more effective than morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA? (2) Do patients treated with liposomal bupivacaine-based PAI experience fewer opioid-related adverse events compared with patients treated with morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA?

Methods: This multicenter, blind trial randomized 119 patients undergoing TKA with spinal anesthesia to receive spinal anesthesia plus periarticular injection with liposomal bupivacaine (40 patients), spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine plus intrathecal morphine (41 patients) but no liposomal bupivacaine injection, or spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine (38 patients) and no liposomal bupivacaine injection. The two groups that did not receive periarticular liposomal bupivacaine did receive periarticular injection with ropivacaine, and all three groups had ketorolac (30 mg) plus epinephrine (1:1000) in the periarticular injections. Patients in all three groups received identical perioperative multimodal analgesic and antiemetic drugs. All patients were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized and no patients were lost to followup. The primary study endpoints were visual analog score (VAS) for pain and narcotic use during postoperative day 1. Secondary endpoints included side effects associated with narcotic administration during the hospital stay.

Results: Mean VAS pain in the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group was lower than that for the ropivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (1.8 ± 2.1 versus 3.3 ± 2.3, p = 0.005, mean difference: 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-2.5) and 12 hours (1.5 ± 2.0 versus 3.3 ± 2.4, p < 0.001, mean difference: 1.8, 95% CI, 0.8-2.8) after surgery. The morphine spinal group had lower pain compared with the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (0.9 ± 1.8 versus 1.8 ± 2.1, p = 0.035, mean difference: 1.0, 95% CI, 0.1-1.8), but there was no difference at 12 hours (0.8 ± 1.5 versus 1.5 ± 2.0, p = 0.086, mean difference: 0.7, 95% CI, -0.1 to 1.5). The magnitude of the differences at 6 and 12 hours are near the lower end of minimal clinically important differences reported in the literature, and thus the improvement shown in this study may only represent a small clinical improvement. Both the liposomal bupivacaine group (13% [five of 40]) and the ropivacaine group (5% [two of 38]) had fewer incidents of itching (pruritus) than the spinal morphine group (38% [15 of 41]) (p = 0.001).

238,27339124,No Difference in Early Analgesia Between Liposomal Bupivacaine Injection and Intrathecal Morphine After TKA.,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,  Other,"""Trend toward significance"" // ""Numerically longer survival"" or equivalent verbiage",Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Background: Opioid analgesics have been a standard modality for postoperative pain management after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) but are also associated with increased risk of nausea, pruritus, vomiting, respiratory depression, prolonged ileus, and cognitive dysfunction. There is still a need for a method of anesthesia that can deliver effective long-term postoperative pain relief without incurring the high cost and health burden of opioids and nerve blocks.

Questions/purposes: (1) Is liposomal bupivacaine-based periarticular injection (PAI) more effective than morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA? (2) Do patients treated with liposomal bupivacaine-based PAI experience fewer opioid-related adverse events compared with patients treated with morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA?

Methods: This multicenter, blind trial randomized 119 patients undergoing TKA with spinal anesthesia to receive spinal anesthesia plus periarticular injection with liposomal bupivacaine (40 patients), spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine plus intrathecal morphine (41 patients) but no liposomal bupivacaine injection, or spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine (38 patients) and no liposomal bupivacaine injection. The two groups that did not receive periarticular liposomal bupivacaine did receive periarticular injection with ropivacaine, and all three groups had ketorolac (30 mg) plus epinephrine (1:1000) in the periarticular injections. Patients in all three groups received identical perioperative multimodal analgesic and antiemetic drugs. All patients were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized and no patients were lost to followup. The primary study endpoints were visual analog score (VAS) for pain and narcotic use during postoperative day 1. Secondary endpoints included side effects associated with narcotic administration during the hospital stay.

Results: Mean VAS pain in the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group was lower than that for the ropivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (1.8 ± 2.1 versus 3.3 ± 2.3, p = 0.005, mean difference: 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-2.5) and 12 hours (1.5 ± 2.0 versus 3.3 ± 2.4, p < 0.001, mean difference: 1.8, 95% CI, 0.8-2.8) after surgery. The morphine spinal group had lower pain compared with the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (0.9 ± 1.8 versus 1.8 ± 2.1, p = 0.035, mean difference: 1.0, 95% CI, 0.1-1.8), but there was no difference at 12 hours (0.8 ± 1.5 versus 1.5 ± 2.0, p = 0.086, mean difference: 0.7, 95% CI, -0.1 to 1.5).

Conclusions: This prospective multicenter three-arm blind randomized controlled trial showed potentially improved pain control at 6 and 12 hours in the liposomal bupivacaine and intrathecal morphine groups compared with the ropivacaine group at the cost of much higher incidences of pruritus (itching) in the intrathecal morphine group. Based on these results, we prefer the use of PAI with liposomal bupivacaine as an alternative to spinal anesthesia with intrathecal morphine as a result of similar postoperative pain control and the potential for reducing adverse events.",no_spin,7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.8539324402809143, 'probability': 0.4257374107837677}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -0.917399525642395, 'probability': 0.3995566964149475}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.7700046300888062, 'probability': 0.46301090717315674}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.6522212624549866, 'probability': 0.5208874344825745}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.6123852133750916, 'probability': 0.5420563817024231}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.5467612147331238, 'probability': 0.5788214802742004}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.6431564688682556, 'probability': 0.5256307125091553}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.8448674082756042, 'probability': 0.4296143054962158}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.5676702857017517, 'probability': 0.5668445229530334}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.8867716789245605, 'probability': 0.4119836091995239}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -1.1814460754394531, 'probability': 0.30683469772338867}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.4744851589202881, 'probability': 0.6222053170204163}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.4464918375015259, 'probability': 0.6398690342903137}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -1.0335956811904907, 'probability': 0.35572558641433716}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.6863653063774109, 'probability': 0.5034024715423584}]"

rare.
PURPOSE: To compare the clinical outcomes of arthroscopic anatomic DB ACLR with 
a hamstring tendon autograft versus irradiated allograft.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: Between 2008 and 2009, a total of 107 patients undergoing arthroscopic 
DB ACLR were prospectively randomized consecutively into 1 of 2 groups 
(autograft [Auto] group and irradiated allograft [Ir-Allo] group). All the 
surgical procedures were performed by the same senior surgeon using the DB 
reconstruction technique. All irradiated hamstring tendon allografts were 
sterilized with 2.5 Mrad of irradiation before distribution and were obtained 
from a single certified tissue bank. Graft fixation on the femoral side was by 
an Endobutton, and on the tibial side by a bioabsorbable interference screw 
augmented with a staple. The same rehabilitation protocol was applied to all 
patients. Before surgery and at a mean of 6.9 years of follow-up, patients were 
evaluated by the same observer according to objective and subjective clinical 
evaluations including detailed history, physical examination, radiography, 
functional knee ligament testing, KT-2000 arthrometer testing, Harner vertical 
jump and Daniel 1-legged hop tests, Lysholm score, Tegner score, International 
Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) standard evaluation form, and Cincinnati

surgery may be challenging because surgical trauma deeply alters the joint 
microenvironment, causing the release of several catabolic molecules and 
proinflammatory factors that might slow down functional recovery. The 
possibility of using hyaluronic acid (HA) to promote postoperative pain relief 
and expedite functional improvement seems attractive, considering its biological 
properties.
PURPOSE: The aim of the present double-blind randomized controlled trial was to 
evaluate the effects, in terms of pain control and functional recovery, provided 
by a single HA injection performed at the end of arthroscopic meniscectomy.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: A total of 90 patients, 18 to 55 years old, were included according to 
the following criteria: (1) chronic, symptomatic meniscal tears requiring 
partial resection; (2) a healthy contralateral knee; (3) no previous surgery on 
the index knee; and (4) no other concurrent articular lesions requiring surgical 
treatment (eg, cartilage or ligament injuries). Patients were randomized into 2 
treatment groups: one underwent meniscectomy alone, whereas the other also 
received an injection of 3 mL HA at the end of the procedure. The primary 
outcomes were pain control and functional recovery. All patients were 
evaluated at baseline and then at 15, 30, 60, and 180 days using the following 
tools: International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective, Knee injury 
and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, VAS 
for general health status, and Tegner scores. The transpatellar circumference 
and active and passive ranges of motion were also recorded during the follow-up 
evaluations.
RESULTS: No major adverse events were reported using HA postoperatively. No 
significant intergroup difference was documented at any follow-up evaluation for 
any of the clinical scores. No difference was observed in the objective 
measurements. The mean time to return to full sports activity was not different 
between groups, and a comparable satisfaction rate was recorded in both 
treatment groups.

groin pain and diminished functional outcome after THA. So far, estimation by 
eye and palpation is the standard procedure to intraoperatively assess the 
distance of the cup to the anterior rim. However, novel technologies such as 
imageless navigation enable intraoperative measurements of the cup in relation 
to the psoas tendon and bony landmarks.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether psoas impingement can be reduced using 
imageless navigation compared with the standard technique.
METHODS: The current study is a reanalysis of data from a randomized controlled 
trial evaluating navigation for THA; 135 patients were randomized for surgery 
with or without the use of imageless navigation. The primary outcome was the 
risk for anterior protrusion of the cup above the acetabular rim and thus 
potential psoas impingement, defined as an overhang of the cup above the 
anterior acetabular rim as measured on postoperative CT, which was either 
controlled with the help of navigation or standard control by eye and palpation 
intraoperatively. Postoperatively, the anterior protrusion of the cup above the 
acetabular rim was measured on three-dimensional (3-D) CT by a blinded, external 
institute. In addition to patient-related outcome measures, the Harris hip 
score, Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and EuroQol were 
obtained 1 year postoperatively. Altogether 123 data sets were available for 
primary analysis and 115 were available for 1-year followup.
RESULTS: There was no difference, with the numbers available, between the 
navigated and the control groups in terms of the mean distance of the cup below 
the anterosuperior acetabular rim (3.9 mm; -5.3 to 12.6 mm versus 4.4 mm; -7.9 
to 13.7 mm; p = 0.72) or the anteroinferior acetabular rim (4.7 mm; -6.2 to 14.8 
mm versus 4.2 mm; -7.1 to 16.3 mm; p = 0.29). There was no difference, with the 
numbers available, in terms of the proportion of cups with anterior overhang 
(7%, four of 57 versus, 15%, 10 of 66; p = 0.16), respectively. After 
controlling for potential confounding variables such as cup inclination, cup 
size, patient age, BMI, stage of arthritis, and length of skin incision, we 
found cup anteversion (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% CI, 0.81-0.93; p < 0.001) 
and female sex (HR, 3.88; 95% CI, 1.01-14.93; p = 0.049) were associated with a 
propensity to potential psoas impingement. With the numbers available, there 
were no differences observed in clinical scores between groups with and without 
anterior cup protrusion.

mm versus 4.2 mm; -7.1 to 16.3 mm; p = 0.29). There was no difference, with the 
numbers available, in terms of the proportion of cups with anterior overhang 
(7%, four of 57 versus, 15%, 10 of 66; p = 0.16), respectively. After 
controlling for potential confounding variables such as cup inclination, cup 
size, patient age, BMI, stage of arthritis, and length of skin incision, we 
found cup anteversion (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% CI, 0.81-0.93; p < 0.001) 
and female sex (HR, 3.88; 95% CI, 1.01-14.93; p = 0.049) were associated with a 
propensity to potential psoas impingement. With the numbers available, there 
were no differences observed in clinical scores between groups with and without 
anterior cup protrusion.
CONCLUSIONS: We found no differences between imageless navigation and estimation 
by eye and palpation in preventing potential psoas impingement. Despite the 
comparable clinical outcome for patients with and without cup protrusion, the 
orthopaedic surgeon should be especially aware of propensity for psoas 
impingement in women.",no_spin,5,5,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.5269343256950378, 'probability': 0.5904121994972229}, {'token': 28782, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.3856284618377686, 'probability': 0.25016653537750244}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.6057164072990417, 'probability': 0.5456833243370056}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.3968038558959961, 'probability': 0.6724659204483032}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.738421618938446, 'probability': 0.47786757349967957}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.414885014295578, 'probability': 0.6604162454605103}]",7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.4365874230861664, 'probability': 0.6462380290031433}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.197794795036316, 'probability': 0.30185914039611816}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.37124142050743103, 'probability': 0.6898773312568665}]",7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.4677501916885376, 'probability': 0.6264100074768066}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.496514081954956, 'probability': 0.22390933334827423}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.2865276336669922, 'probability': 0.7508663535118103}]",7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.2744656503200531, 'probability': 0.7599781155586243}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.2242374420166016, 'probability': 0.2939818203449249}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.39751923084259033, 'probability': 0.6719850301742554}]"

Methods: Forty-two consecutive patients scheduled for hip arthroscopy were randomized into 2 postoperative pain control groups. One group received preemptive intra-articular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection, and the second group received preemptive periacetabular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection. Before closure all patients received an additional dose of 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% intra-articularly. Data were compared with respect to postoperative pain with visual analog scale (VAS) and analgesic consumption, documented in a pain diary for 2 weeks after surgery.

Results: Twenty-one patients were treated with intra-articular injection, and 21 patients with peri-acetabular injection. There were no significant differences with regards to patient demographics or surgical procedures. VAS scores recorded during the first 30 minutes postoperatively and 18 hours after surgery were significantly lower in the periacetabular group compared with in the intra-articular group (0.667 ± 1.49 vs 2.11 ± 2.29; P < .045 and 2.62 ± 2.2 vs 4.79 ± 2.6; P < .009).

Methods: Forty-two consecutive patients scheduled for hip arthroscopy were randomized into 2 postoperative pain control groups. One group received preemptive intra-articular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection, and the second group received preemptive periacetabular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection. Before closure all patients received an additional dose of 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% intra-articularly. Data were compared with respect to postoperative pain with visual analog scale (VAS) and analgesic consumption, documented in a pain diary for 2 weeks after surgery.

Results: Twenty-one patients were treated with intra-articular injection, and 21 patients with peri-acetabular injection. There were no significant differences with regards to patient demographics or surgical procedures. VAS scores recorded during the first 30 minutes postoperatively were 0.667 ± 1.49 in the periacetabular group versus 2.11 ± 2.29 in the intra-articular group (P < .045). VAS scores at 18 hours after surgery were 2.62 ± 2.2 in the periacetabular group versus 4.79 ± 2.6 in the intra-articular group (P < .009).

Design: A randomised controlled trial of 503 participants followed for six months.

Setting: Participants were recruited from two tertiary acute care settings in Kingston, ON, Canada.

Participants: The broad inclusion criteria were patients aged і16 presenting for acute medical assessment and treatment of a simple grade 1 or 2 ankle sprain. Exclusions were patients with multiple injuries, other conditions limiting mobility, and ankle injuries that required immobilisation and those unable to accommodate the time intensive study protocol.

Intervention: Participants received either usual care, consisting of written instructions regarding protection, rest, cryotherapy, compression, elevation, and graduated weight bearing activities, or usual care enhanced with a supervised programme of physiotherapy.

Main outcome measures: The primary outcome of efficacy was the proportion of participants reporting excellent recovery assessed with the foot and ankle outcome score (FAOS). Excellent recovery was defined as a score і450/500 at three months. A difference of at least 15% increase in the absolute proportion of participants with excellent recovery was deemed clinically important. Secondary analyses included the assessment of excellent recovery at one and six months; change from baseline using continuous scores at one, three, and six months; and clinical and biomechanical measures of ankle function, assessed at one, three, and six months.

Results: The absolute proportion of patients achieving excellent recovery at three months was not significantly different between the physiotherapy (98/229, 43%) and usual care (79/214, 37%) arms (absolute difference 6%, 95% confidence interval -3% to 15%).

61,27852621,Effect of early supervised physiotherapy on recovery from acute ankle sprain: randomised controlled trial,BMJ,"RESULTS: ""Trend toward significance"" // ""Numerically longer survival"" or similar verbiage",,Emergency Medicine,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Objective: To assess the efficacy of a programme of supervised physiotherapy on the recovery of simple grade 1 and 2 ankle sprains.

Design: A randomised controlled trial of 503 participants followed for six months.

Setting: Participants were recruited from two tertiary acute care settings in Kingston, ON, Canada.

Participants: The broad inclusion criteria were patients aged і16 presenting for acute medical assessment and treatment of a simple grade 1 or 2 ankle sprain. Exclusions were patients with multiple injuries, other conditions limiting mobility, and ankle injuries that required immobilisation and those unable to accommodate the time intensive study protocol.

Intervention: Participants received either usual care, consisting of written instructions regarding protection, rest, cryotherapy, compression, elevation, and graduated weight bearing activities, or usual care enhanced with a supervised programme of physiotherapy.

Main outcome measures: The primary outcome of efficacy was the proportion of participants reporting excellent recovery assessed with the foot and ankle outcome score (FAOS). Excellent recovery was defined as a score і450/500 at three months. A difference of at least 15% increase in the absolute proportion of participants with excellent recovery was deemed clinically important. Secondary analyses included the assessment of excellent recovery at one and six months; change from baseline using continuous scores at one, three, and six months; and clinical and biomechanical measures of ankle function, assessed at one, three, and six months.

Results: The absolute proportion of patients achieving excellent recovery at three months was not significantly different between the physiotherapy (98/229, 43%) and usual care (79/214, 37%) arms (absolute difference 6%, 95% confidence interval -3% to 15%). These results remained similar when the FAOS was analysed as a continuous change score.

Methods: A total of 181 overweight and obese adolescents aged 13-15 years old were randomized in the three study groups (""Diet & Activity,"" ""Activity,"" and Control). The Activity intervention included a 45-minute, 3-day per week supervised training program, while the Diet & Activity intervention included a supplementary 15 minutes of group-based sessions attended by the parents. The intervention lasted 3 months and the participants were followed for another 3 months after the intervention. The participants were assessed for anthropometric measures and activity and fulfilled the modified version of the questionnaire ""Family Eating and Activity Habits Questionnaire"" (FEAHQ).

Methods: A total of 181 overweight and obese adolescents aged 13-15 years old were randomized in the three study groups (""Diet & Activity,"" ""Activity,"" and Control). The Activity intervention included a 45-minute, 3-day per week supervised training program, while the Diet & Activity intervention included a supplementary 15 minutes of group-based sessions attended by the parents. The intervention lasted 3 months and the participants were followed for another 3 months after the intervention. The primary outcome was body mass index (BMI). The participants were assessed for anthropometric measures and activity and fulfilled the modified version of the questionnaire ""Family Eating and Activity Habits Questionnaire"" (FEAHQ).

Results: Both ""Activity"" only and ""Diet & Activity"" groups reduced their mean body mass index (BMI) (-1.1, 95% CI -1.3, -0.8, and -1.4, 95% CI -1.7, -1.2, respectively) compared to control at 3 months, with greater reductions at 6 months (-2.3, 95% CI -2.6, -2.0, and -3.1, 95% CI -3.3, -2.8).

with superior labrum-biceps complex (SLBC) lesions accompanied by a rotator cuff 
tear. However, limited clinical data are available regarding the best technique 
in terms of clinical and anatomic outcomes.
PURPOSE: To compare the clinical and anatomic outcomes of the interference screw 
(IS) and suture anchor (SA) fixation techniques for biceps tenodesis performed 
along with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: A total of 80 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair 
with SLBC lesions were prospectively enrolled and randomly divided according to 
the tenodesis method: the IS and SA groups. The primary outcome was the anatomic 
status of tenodesis estimated using magnetic resonance imaging or 
ultrasonography. Anatomic failure of tenodesis was determined when the biceps 
tendon was not traced in the intertubercular groove directly from the insertion 
site of the IS or SA. Secondary outcomes included functional outcomes evaluated 
with the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, American Shoulder and Elbow 
Surgeons (ASES) score, Simple Shoulder Test (SST), Constant score, Korean 
Shoulder Score (KSS), and long head of the biceps (LHB) score at least 2 years 
after surgery.
RESULTS: Thirty-three patients in the IS group and 34 in the SA group were 
monitored for more than 2 years. Nine anatomic failures of tenodesis were 
observed: 7 in the IS group and 2 in the SA group (P = .083). All postoperative 
functional scores improved compared with the preoperative scores and were not 
significantly different between the groups, including the LHB score (all P > 
.05). In a multivariate analysis using logistic regression, IS fixation (P = 
.003) and a higher work level (P = .022) were factors associated with the 
anatomic failure of tenodesis. In patients with tenodesis failure, the LHB score 
(P = .049) and the degree of Popeye deformity by the patient and examiner (P = 
.004 and .018, respectively) were statistically different compared with patients 
with intact tenodeses.
CONCLUSION: The IS fixation technique was not more effective than SA fixation 
technique in preventing anatomic failure of tenodesis in patients with SLBC

134,28146402,A Multicenter Study of Early Anti-inflammatory Treatment in Patients With Acute Anterior Cruciate Ligament Tear.,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,,Claim benefit based on (+) secondary endpoint,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: It is increasingly recognized that biochemical abnormalities of the 
joint precede radiographic abnormalities of posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) 
by as much as decades. A growing body of evidence strongly suggests that the 
progression from anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury to PTOA is 
multifactorial, involving the interplay between biomechanical disturbances and 
biochemical homeostasis of articular cartilage.
PURPOSE: The purposes of this randomized study using an acute ACL injury model 
were to (1) evaluate the natural progression of inflammatory and 
chondrodegenerative biomarkers, (2) evaluate the relationship between subjective 
reports of pain and inflammatory and chondrodegenerative biomarkers, and (3) 
determine if postinjury arthrocentesis and corticosteroid injection offer the 
ability to alter this biochemical cascade.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: A total of 49 patients were randomized to 4 groups: group 1 
(corticosteroid at 4 days after ACL injury, placebo injection of saline at 2 
weeks), group 2 (placebo at 4 days after ACL injury, corticosteroid at 2 weeks), 
group 3 (corticosteroid at both time intervals), or a placebo group (saline 
injections at both time intervals). Patient-reported outcome measures and 
synovial biomarkers were collected at approximately 4 days, 11 days, and 5 weeks 
after injury. The change between the time points was assessed for all variables 
using Wilcoxon tests, and the relationship between changes in outcome scores and 
biomarkers were assessed by calculating Spearman ПЃ. Outcomes and biomarkers were 
also compared between the 4 groups using Kruskal-Wallis tests.
RESULTS: No adverse events or infections were observed in any study patients. 
With the exception of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) and tumor necrosis 
factor-inducible gene 6 (TSG-6), chondrodegenerative markers worsened over the 
first 5 weeks while all patient-reported outcomes improved during this time, 
regardless of treatment group. Patient-reported outcomes did not differ between 
patients receiving corticosteroid injections and the placebo group. However, 
increases in C-telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II), associated with 
collagen type II breakdown, were significantly greater in the placebo group 
(1.32 В± 1.10 ng/mL) than in either of the groups that received the 
corticosteroid injection within the first several days after injury (group 1: 
0.23 В± 0.27 ng/mL [ P = .01]; group 3: 0.19 В± 0.34 ng/mL [ P = .01]).
CONCLUSION: PTOA begins at the time of injury and results early on in dramatic 
matrix changes in the knee. However, it is encouraging that early intervention 
with an anti-inflammatory agent was able to affect biomarkers of chondral 
degeneration. Should early intervention lead to meaningful changes in either the 
onset or severity of symptomatic PTOA, the current treatment paradigm for 
patients with ACL injury may have to be restructured to include early aspiration 
and intra-articular intervention.",no_spin,7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.378739595413208, 'probability': 0.684723973274231}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.2238752841949463, 'probability': 0.2940882742404938}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.44436708092689514, 'probability': 0.6412299871444702}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.31965315341949463, 'probability': 0.7264009118080139}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.7419884204864502, 'probability': 0.4761661887168884}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.3987705111503601, 'probability': 0.6711446642875671}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.38117125630378723, 'probability': 0.6830609440803528}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -1.0629289150238037, 'probability': 0.34544259309768677}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.3568898141384125, 'probability': 0.6998496651649475}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.44822415709495544, 'probability': 0.6387615203857422}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -1.1507295370101929, 'probability': 0.31640586256980896}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.3149992823600769, 'probability': 0.7297893762588501}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.21730934083461761, 'probability': 0.8046810030937195}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.9769188165664673, 'probability': 0.3764692544937134}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.4026820659637451, 'probability': 0.6685246229171753}]"

treatment focuses on management of respiratory distress and hypoxia. High-flow 
warm humidified oxygen (HFWHO) is increasingly used, but has not been rigorously 
studied in randomised trials. We aimed to examine whether HFWHO provided 
enhanced respiratory support, thereby shortening time to weaning off oxygen.
METHODS: In this open, phase 4, randomised controlled trial, we recruited 
children aged less than 24 months with moderate bronchiolitis attending the 
emergency department of the John Hunter Hospital or the medical unit of the John 
Hunter Children's Hospital in New South Wales, Australia. Patients were randomly 
allocated (1:1) via opaque sealed envelopes to HFWHO (maximum flow of 1 L/kg per 
min to a limit of 20 L/min using 1:1 air-oxygen ratio, resulting in a maximum 
FiO2 of 0В·6) or standard therapy (cold wall oxygen 100% via infant nasal 
cannulae at low flow to a maximum of 2 L/min) using a block size of four and 
stratifying for gestational age at birth. The primary outcome was time from 
randomisation to last use of oxygen therapy. All randomised children were 
included in the primary and secondary safety analyses. This trial is registered

FINDINGS: From July 16, 2012, to May 1, 2015, we randomly assigned 202 children 
to either HFWHO (101 children) or standard therapy (101 children). Median time 
to weaning was 24 h (95% CI 18-28) for standard therapy and 20 h (95% CI 17-34) 
for HFWHO (hazard ratio [HR] for difference in survival distributions 0В·9 [95% 
CI 0В·7-1В·2]; log rank p=0В·61). Fewer children experienced treatment failure on 
HFWHO (14 [14%]) compared with standard therapy (33 [33%]; p=0В·0016); of these 
children, those on HFWHO were supported for longer than were those on standard 
therapy before treatment failure (HR 0В·3; 95% CI 0В·2-0В·6; p<0В·0001). 20 (61%) of 
33 children who experienced treatment failure on standard therapy were rescued 
with HFWHO. 12 (12%) of children on standard therapy required transfer to the 
intensive care unit compared with 14 (14%) of those on HFWHO (difference -1%; 
95% CI -7 to 16; p=0В·41). Four adverse events occurred (oxygen desaturation and 
condensation inhalation in the HFWHO group, and two incidences of oxygen tubing 
disconnection in the standard therapy group); none resulted in withdrawal from 
the trial. No oxygen-related serious adverse events occurred. Secondary 
effectiveness outcomes are reported in the Results section.
INTERPRETATION: HFWHO did not significantly reduce time on oxygen compared with 
standard therapy, suggesting that early use of HFWHO does not modify the 
underlying disease process in moderately severe bronchiolitis. HFWHO might have 
a role as a rescue therapy to reduce the proportion of children requiring 
high-cost intensive care.",no_spin,7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.6140519976615906, 'probability': 0.5411536693572998}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.31548273563385, 'probability': 0.2683447599411011}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.6695377826690674, 'probability': 0.5119451284408569}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.3413371443748474, 'probability': 0.7108191847801208}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.7089658975601196, 'probability': 0.4921528995037079}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.59015953540802, 'probability': 0.5542388558387756}]",7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.40372830629348755, 'probability': 0.6678255200386047}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.1393083333969116, 'probability': 0.32004034519195557}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.4342091381549835, 'probability': 0.6477767825126648}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.4809707999229431, 'probability': 0.6181830167770386}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -1.3241775035858154, 'probability': 0.2660216689109802}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.39569923281669617, 'probability': 0.6732091307640076}]",7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.2798103094100952, 'probability': 0.7559271454811096}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.2026147842407227, 'probability': 0.30040767788887024}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.5145013332366943, 'probability': 0.5977986454963684}]"

treatment focuses on management of respiratory distress and hypoxia. High-flow 
warm humidified oxygen (HFWHO) is increasingly used, but has not been rigorously 
studied in randomised trials. We aimed to examine whether HFWHO provided 
enhanced respiratory support, thereby shortening time to weaning off oxygen.
METHODS: In this open, phase 4, randomised controlled trial, we recruited 
children aged less than 24 months with moderate bronchiolitis attending the 
emergency department of the John Hunter Hospital or the medical unit of the John 
Hunter Children's Hospital in New South Wales, Australia. Patients were randomly 
allocated (1:1) via opaque sealed envelopes to HFWHO (maximum flow of 1 L/kg per 
min to a limit of 20 L/min using 1:1 air-oxygen ratio, resulting in a maximum 
FiO2 of 0·6) or standard therapy (cold wall oxygen 100% via infant nasal 
cannulae at low flow to a maximum of 2 L/min) using a block size of four and 
stratifying for gestational age at birth. The primary outcome was time from 
randomisation to last use of oxygen therapy. Secondary outcomes included treatment 
failure, time to treatment failure, intensive care unit transfer, and adverse 
events. All randomised children were included in the primary and secondary safety 
analyses. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical

techniques for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Controversy has arisen as each 
conceptually differs in how the knee is balanced through bone and soft tissue 
management. The objective of the present study was to compare both the frequency 
of condylar liftoff and the location of femorotibial contact from extension 
through midflexion between patients undergoing GB or MR TKA.
METHODS: A total of 24 knees (23 patients) were randomly assigned at referral to 
either a surgeon performing MR or GB TKA with the same single radius, 
posterior-stabilized implant (12 per cohort). At 1-year postoperation, patients 
underwent biplanar radiographic imaging at 0В°, 20В°, 40В°, and 60В° of flexion. 
Condylar liftoff, contact location, and magnitude of excursion on each condyle 
were measured. Preoperative and postoperative clinical outcome scores were also 
collected.
RESULTS: There was no difference (PВ = .41) in the frequency of liftoff between 
cohorts. The MR cohort had more posterior contact on the medial condyle (P < 
.01) and more anterior contact on the lateral condyle (P < .01) throughout 
flexion. Motion patterns were similar between cohorts, with similar medial (PВ = 
.48) and lateral (PВ = .44) excursion, which was equal in magnitude between 
condyles for both MR (PВ = .48) and GB (PВ = .73). There was no difference in

118,28281235,The Use of Unidirectional Knotless Barbed Suture for Enterotomy Closure in Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: a Randomized Comparative Study.,Obesity Surgery,RESULTS: Focus on (+) secondary endpoint,Other;Claim benefit based on (+) secondary endpoint,Obesity,claude_4.0-sonnet,"PURPOSE: In this study, we assessed feasibility, safety, and time efficiency of 
laparoscopic running enterotomy closure for linear stapled Roux-en-Y Gastric 
Bypass (RYGB) using unidirectional barbed sutures (Stratafixв„ў 2/0- Ethicon).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred patients undergoing laparoscopic RYGB were 
prospectively randomized regarding running enterotomy closure of the linear 
stapled gastrojejunal (GJA) and jejunojejunal anastomosis (JJA). Two groups were 
created: V-group (VicrylВ® 2/0-Ethicon) and S-group (Stratafixв„ў 2/0-Ethicon). 
Time spent on closing the enterotomies was measured from first needle in until 
knot and cut (V-group) or last stitch and cut (S-group). If needed, a 
nonabsorbable ""correction"" (""c""; in order to close a small hiatus at the 
anastomosis) or hemostatic (""h"") stitch was made (using a single ProleneВ® 
2/0-Ethicon).
RESULTS: Average total procedure time was similar (S-group 1:01:22, V-group 
1:00:44, PВ =В 0.340). Closure of the enterotomy (GJA) was significantly shorter 
in the S-group (07:41В min versus 08:13В min in the V-group, PВ =В 0.005). Extra 
stitches (GJA) were performed in 33 patients (16.5%): 3 (h) and 20 (c) in the 
V-group and 1 (h) and 9 (c) in the S-group. Four patients in the V-group 
suffered from postoperative intraluminal bleeding (3 self-limiting, 1 underwent 
endoscopic clipping). In the S-group, 1 patient suffered from leakage at the 
vertical transected staple line of the stomach.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of unidirectional barbed sutures for running enterotomy

laparoscopic running enterotomy closure for linear stapled Roux-en-Y Gastric 
Bypass (RYGB) using unidirectional barbed sutures (Stratafixв„ў 2/0- Ethicon).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred patients undergoing laparoscopic RYGB were 
prospectively randomized regarding running enterotomy closure of the linear 
stapled gastrojejunal (GJA) and jejunojejunal anastomosis (JJA). Two groups were 
created: V-group (VicrylВ® 2/0-Ethicon) and S-group (Stratafixв„ў 2/0-Ethicon). 
Time spent on closing the enterotomies was measured from first needle in until 
knot and cut (V-group) or last stitch and cut (S-group). If needed, a 
nonabsorbable ""correction"" (""c""; in order to close a small hiatus at the 
anastomosis) or hemostatic (""h"") stitch was made (using a single ProleneВ® 
2/0-Ethicon).
RESULTS: Average total procedure time was similar (S-group 1:01:22, V-group 
1:00:44, PВ =В 0.340). Closure of the enterotomy (GJA) was 07:41В min in the 
S-group versus 08:13В min in the V-group (PВ =В 0.005). Extra stitches (GJA) 
were performed in 33 patients (16.5%): 3 (h) and 20 (c) in the V-group and 1 
(h) and 9 (c) in the S-group. Four patients in the V-group suffered from 
postoperative intraluminal bleeding (3 self-limiting, 1 underwent endoscopic 
clipping). In the S-group, 1 patient suffered from leakage at the vertical 
transected staple line of the stomach.
CONCLUSIONS: Unidirectional barbed sutures were not more effective than 
conventional sutures for overall procedure time in patients undergoing 
laparoscopic RYGB.",spin,5,5,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.2881321609020233, 'probability': 0.7496625185012817}, {'token': 28782, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.1973127126693726, 'probability': 0.30200469493865967}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.5541555881500244, 'probability': 0.5745572447776794}]",7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.2913106083869934, 'probability': 0.7472835183143616}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.0774422883987427, 'probability': 0.3404652178287506}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.4294135272502899, 'probability': 0.6508907079696655}]",5,5,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.4410842955112457, 'probability': 0.6433385014533997}, {'token': 28782, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.38896906375885, 'probability': 0.2493322342634201}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.571733832359314, 'probability': 0.5645458102226257}]",5,5,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.37253010272979736, 'probability': 0.6889889240264893}, {'token': 28782, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.5463452339172363, 'probability': 0.21302509307861328}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.3428378701210022, 'probability': 0.7097532749176025}]",5,5,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.21675483882427216, 'probability': 0.8051273226737976}, {'token': 28782, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.4295376539230347, 'probability': 0.2394195944070816}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.47701776027679443, 'probability': 0.6206315159797668}]"

unpredictable. To overcome the shortcomings of the microfracture technique, 
various augmentation techniques have been developed. However, their efficacies 
remain unclear.
HYPOTHESIS: The quality of cartilage repair and clinical outcomes would be 
superior in patients undergoing high tibial osteotomy (HTO) with microfracture 
and collagen augmentation compared to those undergoing HTO with microfracture 
alone without collagen augmentation for the treatment of medial compartment 
osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.
METHODS: Twenty-eight patients undergoing HTO were randomized into 2 groups: 
microfracture alone (group 1, n = 14) or microfracture with collagen 
augmentation (group 2, n = 14). At 1 year postoperatively, second-look 
arthroscopic surgery and biopsy of repaired cartilage were performed at the time 
of HTO plate removal. Biopsy specimens were graded using the International 
Cartilage Repair Society Visual Assessment Scale II (ICRS II). In addition, 
imaging outcomes in terms of the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage 
repair tissue (MOCART) score were assessed based on magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI). Finally, clinical outcomes in terms of the visual analog scale (VAS) for 
pain score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International 
Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and Tegner activity scale score were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: The mean ICRS II score in group 2 was significantly higher than that in 
group 1 (1053.2 vs 885.4, respectively; P = .002). Group 2 showed greater 
improvement in tissue morphology, cell morphology, surface architecture, 
middle/deep zone assessment, and overall assessment compared with group 1 ( P < 
.050 for all comparisons). Imaging outcomes based on the MOCART score were 
superior in group 2 compared to those in group 1 on MRI at 1 year 
postoperatively (64.6 vs 45.4, respectively; P = .001). The degree of defect 
repair was better in group 2 than in group 1 ( P = .040). Clinical outcomes in 
terms of the VAS for pain score, KOOS, IKDC score, and Tegner activity scale 
score were improved in both groups without between-group differences ( P > .100 
for all comparisons).
CONCLUSION: The quality of cartilage repair after microfracture with collagen 
augmentation was superior to that after microfracture alone in patients 
undergoing HTO. Clinical results after 1 year did not reflect this difference in 
tissue repair. Therefore, a longer follow-up of the cohort is needed to answer

Biological analysis of PRP has demonstrated an anti-inflammatory effect on the intra-articular environment.

Purpose: To compare the clinical and biological effects of an intra-articular injection of PRP with those of an intra-articular injection of HA in patients with mild to moderate knee OA.

Study design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods: A total of 111 patients with symptomatic unilateral knee OA received a series of either leukocyte-poor PRP or HA injections under ultrasound guidance. Clinical data were collected before treatment and at 4 time points across a 1-year period. Synovial fluid was also collected for analysis of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers before treatment and at 12 and 24 weeks after treatment. Several measures were used to assess results: (1) Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale; (2) International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee evaluation, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, and Lysholm knee score; and (3) difference in intra-articular biochemical marker concentrations.

Results: There were 49 patients randomized to treatment with PRP and 50 randomized to treatment with HA. No difference was seen between the groups in the primary outcome measure (WOMAC pain score). In the secondary outcome measure, linear contrasts identified a significantly higher IKDC score in the PRP group compared with the HA group at 24 weeks (mean ± standard error [SE], 65.5 ± 3.6 vs 55.8 ± 3.8, respectively; P = .013) and at final follow-up (52 weeks) (57.6 ± 3.37 vs 46.6 ± 3.76, respectively; P = .003). Linear contrasts also identified a statistically lower VAS score in the PRP group versus the HA group at 24 weeks (mean ± SE, 34.6 ± 3.24 vs 48.6 ± 3.7, respectively; P = .0096) and 52 weeks (44 ± 4.6 vs 57.3 ± 3.8, respectively; P = .0039). An examination of fixed effects showed that patients with mild OA and a lower body mass index had a statistically significant improvement in outcomes. In the biochemical analysis, differences between groups approached significance for interleukin-1_ (mean ± SE, 0.14 ± 0.05 pg/mL [PRP] vs 0.34 ± 0.16 pg/mL [HA]; P = .06) and tumor necrosis factor _ (0.08 ± 0.01 pg/mL [PRP] vs 0.2 ± 0.18 pg/mL [HA]; P = .068) at 12-week follow-up.

Conclusion: We found no difference between HA and PRP at any time point in the primary outcome measure: the patient-reported WOMAC pain score. Significant improvements were seen in other patient-reported outcome measures, with results favoring PRP over HA. Preceding a significant difference in subjective outcomes favoring PRP, there was a trend toward a decrease in 2 proinflammatory cytokines, which suggest that the anti-inflammatory properties of PRP may contribute to an improvement of symptoms.",no_spin,7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.4814942479133606, 'probability': 0.6178594827651978}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -0.8009184002876282, 'probability': 0.448916494846344}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.4800195097923279, 'probability': 0.6187713146209717}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.33484941720962524, 'probability': 0.7154457569122314}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.636100709438324, 'probability': 0.5293525457382202}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.3519749939441681, 'probability': 0.7032977342605591}]",7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.42190802097320557, 'probability': 0.6557943224906921}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -0.9024771451950073, 'probability': 0.4055638015270233}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.31567493081092834, 'probability': 0.7292963862419128}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.5052902698516846, 'probability': 0.6033304333686829}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -1.1165664196014404, 'probability': 0.3274020254611969}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.32277044653892517, 'probability': 0.7241400480270386}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.2660275101661682, 'probability': 0.7664180397987366}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -1.0022923946380615, 'probability': 0.3670370578765869}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.45879122614860535, 'probability': 0.632047176361084}]"

Methods: Black and Hispanic adults (N = 405) with body mass index 25-50 kg/m2 selected one of ten small change eating strategies and a physical activity goal, randomly with/without PA/SA. Participants were followed by community health workers at set intervals (weekly in months 1-3; biweekly in months 4-9; once monthly in months 10-12).

Results: There was no difference in weight loss at 12 months between participants in the small change approach alone (1.1%) versus the small change PA/SA intervention (1.2%). During treatment, 9% of participants lost at least 7% of their initial body weight. Participants who reported more interval life events had a lower likelihood of losing weight (P < 0.0001).

of LB in comparison to a single-shot peripheral nerve block; however, no study 
has investigated LB in a total shoulder arthroplasty population. Therefore, this 
study compared LB vs. an indwelling interscalene nerve block (IINB).
METHODS: This is a prospective, randomized study of 83 consecutive shoulder 
arthroplasty patients; 36 patients received LB and a ""bridge"" of 30 mL of 0.5%

Methods: Sixty morbid obese patients (BMI і 35) were evaluated before and after 12 weeks of bariatric surgery in order to compare the impact of two different exercise programs on body composition and functional capacity outcomes. Participants were divided into three groups: aerobic (A), aerobic-strength (AS), and control (C) group. Aerobic capacity was assessed with 12-min walk-run test (12MWRT). One-repetition maximum (1RM) test was performed to evaluation upper limb muscle strength. Lower extremity functional capacity was assessed by sit-to-stand test.

Results: Weight, percent body fat (PBF), and fat mass (FM) reduced greater in the trial groups in comparison to the C group (P < 0.05). In the AS group, the reduction of fat-free mass (FFM) was significantly lower than that in the other groups. Mean changes in 12MWRT increased significantly in the intervention groups. The mean change in the sit-to-stand scores was not statistically significant between the three groups.

111,28527156,The Effect of Aerobic or Aerobic-Strength Exercise on Body Composition and Functional Capacity in Patients with BMI в‰Ґ35 after Bariatric Surgery: a Randomized Control Trial.,Obesity Surgery,RESULTS: Other,,Obesity,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Background: Although previous studies suggested that bariatric surgery is the most effective and sustainable treatment method for morbid obesity in long term, but without changing in lifestyle, maintaining optimal weight loss is almost impossible.

Methods: Sixty morbid obese patients (BMI і 35) were evaluated before and after 12 weeks of bariatric surgery in order to compare the impact of two different exercise programs on body composition and functional capacity outcomes. Participants were divided into three groups: aerobic (A), aerobic-strength (AS), and control (C) group. The primary outcome was body composition. Secondary outcomes included functional capacity measures. Aerobic capacity was assessed with 12-min walk-run test (12MWRT). One-repetition maximum (1RM) test was performed to evaluation upper limb muscle strength. Lower extremity functional capacity was assessed by sit-to-stand test.

Results: Weight, percent body fat (PBF), and fat mass (FM) reduced greater in the trial groups in comparison to the C group (P < 0.05). In the AS group, the reduction of fat-free mass (FFM) was significantly lower than that in the other groups. Mean changes in 12MWRT increased significantly in the intervention groups. The mean change in the sit-to-stand scores was not statistically significant between the three groups. Comparing the intervention groups showed that mean changes in 1RM variables increased in AS group (P = 0.03).

regimens possessing in vitro MRSA activity provide improved outcomes compared 
with treatments lacking MRSA activity.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 
yields a higher clinical cure rate of uncomplicated cellulitis than cephalexin 
alone.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized 
superiority trial in 5 US emergency departments among outpatients older than 12 
years with cellulitis and no wound, purulent drainage, or abscess enrolled from 
April 2009 through June 2012. All participants had soft tissue ultrasound 
performed at the time of enrollment to exclude abscess. Final follow-up was 
August 2012.
INTERVENTIONS: Cephalexin, 500 mg 4 times daily, plus 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily, for 7 days (nвЂ‰=вЂ‰248 
participants) or cephalexin plus placebo for 7 days (nвЂ‰=вЂ‰248 participants).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome determined a priori in the 
per-protocol group was clinical cure, defined as absence of these clinical 
failure criteria at follow-up visits: fever; increase in erythema (>25%), 
swelling, or tenderness (days 3-4); no decrease in erythema, swelling, or 
tenderness (days 8-10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness 
(days 14-21). A clinically significant difference was defined as greater than 
10%.
RESULTS: Among 500 randomized participants, 496 (99%) were included in the 
modified intention-to-treat analysis and 411 (82.2%) in the per-protocol 
analysis (median age, 40 years [range, 15-78 years]; 58.4% male; 10.9% had 
diabetes). Median length and width of erythema were 13.0 cm and 10.0 cm. In the 
per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 182 (83.5%) of 218 
participants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 165 
(85.5%) of 193 in the cephalexin group (difference, -2.0%; 95% CI, -9.7% to

37,28698133,Randomized controlled trial of internal and external targeted temperature management methods in post- cardiac arrest patients.,The American Journal of Emergency Medicine,RESULTS: Focus on (+) subgroup analysis,Claim benefit based on (+) subgroup analysis,Emergency Medicine,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Targeted temperature management post-cardiac arrest is currently 
implemented using various methods, broadly categorized as internal and external. 
This study aimed to evaluate survival-to-hospital discharge and neurological 
outcomes (Glasgow-Pittsburgh Score) of post-cardiac arrest patients undergoing 
internal cooling verses external cooling.
METHODOLOGY: A randomized controlled trial of post-resuscitation cardiac arrest 
patients was conducted from October 2008-September 2014. Patients were 
randomized to either internal or external cooling methods. The primary outcome 
was survival-to-hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes included neurological 
outcomes and complications. Historical controls were selected matched by age and 
gender. Analysis using SPSS version 21.0 presented descriptive statistics and 
frequencies while univariate logistic regression was done using R 3.1.3.
RESULTS: 23 patients were randomized to internal cooling and 22 patients to 
external cooling and 42 matched controls were selected. No significant 
difference was seen between internal and external cooling in terms of survival, 
neurological outcomes and complications. In the internal cooling arm, there was 
lower risk of developing overcooling (p=0.01) and rebound hyperthermia (p=0.02). 
Compared to normothermia, internal cooling had higher survival (OR=3.36, 95% 
CI=(1.130, 10.412), and lower risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias (OR=0.18, 
95% CI=(0.04, 0.63)). Cooling curves showed tighter temperature control for

36,28698133,Randomized controlled trial of internal and external targeted temperature management methods in post- cardiac arrest patients.,The American Journal of Emergency Medicine,RESULTS: Focus on (+) subgroup analysis,Claim benefit based on (+) subgroup analysis,Emergency Medicine,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Targeted temperature management post-cardiac arrest is currently 
implemented using various methods, broadly categorized as internal and external. 
This study aimed to evaluate survival-to-hospital discharge and neurological 
outcomes (Glasgow-Pittsburgh Score) of post-cardiac arrest patients undergoing 
internal cooling verses external cooling.
METHODOLOGY: A randomized controlled trial of post-resuscitation cardiac arrest 
patients was conducted from October 2008-September 2014. Patients were 
randomized to either internal or external cooling methods. Historical controls 
were selected matched by age and gender. Analysis using SPSS version 21.0 
presented descriptive statistics and frequencies while univariate logistic 
regression was done using R 3.1.3.
RESULTS: 23 patients were randomized to internal cooling and 22 patients to 
external cooling and 42 matched controls were selected. No significant 
difference was seen between internal and external cooling in terms of survival, 
neurological outcomes and complications. However in the internal cooling arm, 
there was lower risk of developing overcooling (p=0.01) and rebound hyperthermia 
(p=0.02). Compared to normothermia, internal cooling had higher survival 
(OR=3.36, 95% CI=(1.130, 10.412), and lower risk of developing cardiac 
arrhythmias (OR=0.18, 95% CI=(0.04, 0.63)). Subgroup analysis showed those with 
cardiac cause of arrest (OR=4.29, 95% CI=(1.26, 15.80)) and sustained ROSC 
(OR=5.50, 95% CI=(1.64, 20.39)) had better survival with internal cooling 
compared to normothermia. Cooling curves showed tighter temperature control for 
internal compared to external cooling.
CONCLUSION: Internal cooling showed tighter temperature control compared to 
external cooling. Internal cooling can potentially provide better 
survival-to-hospital discharge outcomes and reduce cardiac arrhythmia 
complications in carefully selected patients as compared to normothermia.",no_spin,7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.4255444407463074, 'probability': 0.6534139513969421}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -0.7999377250671387, 'probability': 0.44935691356658936}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.5344187021255493, 'probability': 0.5860098600387573}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.28729864954948425, 'probability': 0.750287652015686}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.5912859439849854, 'probability': 0.5536149144172668}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.4703664183616638, 'probability': 0.6247733235359192}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.3120059072971344, 'probability': 0.7319771647453308}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.7022376656532288, 'probability': 0.4954753518104553}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.4664057791233063, 'probability': 0.6272526979446411}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.41001126170158386, 'probability': 0.6636428236961365}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -1.0924662351608276, 'probability': 0.33538833260536194}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.43193069100379944, 'probability': 0.6492543816566467}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.2400888204574585, 'probability': 0.7865579724311829}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.9317461252212524, 'probability': 0.3938653767108917}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.5016318559646606, 'probability': 0.6055417060852051}]"

(MEND2-5 for ages 2-5 or MEND/CATCH6-12 for ages 6-12) against a primary 
care-centered program (Next Steps) in low-income children.
METHODS: Five hundred forty-nine Hispanic and black children (BMIвЂ‰в‰ҐвЂ‰85th

men), 351 (99%) completed the trial. Of these patients, 120/175 (69%) in the 
48-hour group had a favorable outcome at 6 months compared with 112/176 (64%) in 
the 24-hour group (difference, 4.9%; 95% CI, -5% to 14.8%; relative risk [RR], 
1.08; 95% CI, 0.93-1.25; P = .33). Six-month mortality was 48/175 (27%) in the 
48-hour group and 60/177 (34%) in the 24-hour group (difference, -6.5%; 95% CI, 
-16.1% to 3.1%; RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.59-1.11; P = .19). Time to mortality 
between the 48-hour group and the 24-hour group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 
0.54-1.15; P = .22). Adverse events occurred in 97% of the 48-hour group and 91% 
of the 24-hour group (difference, 5.6%; 95% CI, 0.6%-10.6%; RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 
1.01-1.12; P = .04). The median length of intensive care unit stay was 151 hours 
in the 48-hour group versus 117 hours in the 24-hour group (P < .001), and 
hospital stay was 11 versus 12 days (P = .50).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Targeted temperature management at 33°C for 48 hours 
was not more effective on 6-month neurologic outcome than targeted temperature 
management at 33°C for 24 hours in unconscious survivors from out-of-hospital 
cardiac arrest admitted to the ICU.",spin,5.,5,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.5864812135696411, 'probability': 0.5562812685966492}, {'token': 28782, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.340631127357483, 'probability': 0.2616804540157318}, {'token': 28723, 'token_string': '.', 'logits': -0.6715580224990845, 'probability': 0.5109119415283203}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.6888625621795654, 'probability': 0.5021468997001648}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.4290313720703125, 'probability': 0.651139497756958}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.782446026802063, 'probability': 0.45728611946105957}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.45160889625549316, 'probability': 0.6366031169891357}]",7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.48312240839004517, 'probability': 0.6168542504310608}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.2117772102355957, 'probability': 0.2976677715778351}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.4180625379085541, 'probability': 0.6583210229873657}]",7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.49539315700531006, 'probability': 0.6093313097953796}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.5407891273498535, 'probability': 0.21421200037002563}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.4371584951877594, 'probability': 0.6458690166473389}]",7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.294586181640625, 'probability': 0.7448397278785706}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.5039677619934082, 'probability': 0.22224658727645874}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.5231636762619019, 'probability': 0.592642605304718}]"

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: A total of 60 patients (30 control; 30 PRP) were initially randomized 
to receive 2 ultrasound-guided injections of PRP to the tendon repair site at 7 
and 14 days after double-row arthroscopic supraspinatus repair or not. A total 
of 55 patients (91.7%) underwent a clinical review and magnetic resonance

229,28844420,Liposomal bupivacaine versus interscalene nerve block for pain control after shoulder arthroplasty: a prospective randomized trial.,Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery,  Other,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Shoulder arthroplasty is the fastest growing joint replacement 
surgery in the United States, and optimal postoperative pain management is 
critical to optimize outcomes for these surgeries. Liposomal bupivacaine (LB) 
has gained popularity for its potential to provide extended postoperative pain 
relief with possibly fewer side effects. The goal of this study was to assess 
the impact of LB compared with continuous interscalene nerve block (CISB) in 
terms of postoperative pain control after shoulder arthroplasty surgery.
METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled clinical trial compared consecutive 
patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty treated with CISB vs. LB with a single 
bolus interscalene block. The primary outcome measures included pain assessment 
up to 24 hours after surgery; in addition, all doses and times of narcotics 
administered during the inpatient stay were recorded. Patient-reported outcome 
measures for pain, satisfaction, and functional outcomes were recorded 
postoperatively.
RESULTS: A total of 70 of 74 consecutive patients who underwent shoulder 
arthroplasty were included in the study. The LB group had equivalent narcotic 
use, pain scores, and time to first narcotic rescue compared with the CISB group 
within the first 24 hours (P > .05). The LB group had higher American Shoulder 
and Elbow Surgeons score and Penn Shoulder Score at final follow-up. There was 
an increased number of complications and cost for the CISB group.
CONCLUSION: Liposomal bupivacaine was not more effective on pain control than 
continuous interscalene nerve block in patients with shoulder arthroplasty.",spin,5,5,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.3288910388946533, 'probability': 0.7197213172912598}, {'token': 28782, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.467580795288086, 'probability': 0.23048239946365356}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.5692490339279175, 'probability': 0.5659502744674683}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.22536104917526245, 'probability': 0.7982280254364014}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.7134642601013184, 'probability': 0.4899439513683319}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.32170066237449646, 'probability': 0.7249151468276978}]",7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.3272262215614319, 'probability': 0.7209205627441406}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.254140019416809, 'probability': 0.28532111644744873}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.3670262396335602, 'probability': 0.6927914619445801}]",8,8,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.35880109667778015, 'probability': 0.6985133290290833}, {'token': 28783, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -1.4604235887527466, 'probability': 0.23213791847229004}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.3611363172531128, 'probability': 0.6968839764595032}]",7,7,"[{'token': 28705, 'token_string': '', 'logits': -0.17774003744125366, 'probability': 0.8371599912643433}, {'token': 28787, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.3798437118530273, 'probability': 0.2516178786754608}, {'token': 2, 'token_string': '</s>', 'logits': -0.3806777000427246, 'probability': 0.6833981275558472}]"

conservative option for knee degeneration to provide symptomatic relief and 
delay surgical intervention. Although the current literature provides some 
evidence on the benefits of this technique compared with viscosupplementation, 
no studies have been performed to compare their long-term effects.
PURPOSE: To compare the long-term clinical outcomes provided by intra-articular 
injections of either PRP or hyaluronic acid (HA) to treat knee degenerative 
disease.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: Patients with a history of chronic symptomatic knee degenerative 
changes and osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 0-3) were enrolled: 192 
patients were randomized to undergo 3 blinded weekly intra-articular injections 
of either PRP or HA. Patients were prospectively evaluated before the injection 
and then at 2, 6, 12, and 24 months and a mean of 64.3 months (SD, 7.8 months) 
of follow-up. Evaluation was based on International Knee Documentation Committee 
(IKDC) subjective (primary outcome), EuroQol visual analog scale, and Tegner 
scores; 167 patients reached the final evaluation.
RESULTS: Mean ± SD IKDC subjective score for PRP group changed from 53.3 ± 14.3 
at baseline to 67.3 ± 18.1 at 24 months and to 60.5 ± 19.0 at final evaluation. 
Mean ± SD IKDC subjective score for HA group changed from 50.3 ± 13.2 at 
baseline to 62.1 ± 20.8 at 24 months and to 55.7 ± 18.8 at final evaluation. A 
comparative analysis showed no significant intergroup difference in any of the 
clinical scores at any follow-up point. The median duration of patient 
subjective perception of symptomatic relief was 9 months for HA and 12 months 
for PRP (not significant). The rate of reintervention at 24 months was 22.6% in 
the PRP group versus 37.1% in the HA group (P = .036).

248,30545242,Platelet-Rich Plasma Intra-articular Knee Injections Show No Superiority Versus Viscosupplementation: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,"  Focus on (+) secondary endpoint,   Other",,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections have been proposed as a new 
conservative option for knee degeneration to provide symptomatic relief and 
delay surgical intervention. Although the current literature provides some 
evidence on the benefits of this technique compared with viscosupplementation, 
no studies have been performed to compare their long-term effects.
PURPOSE: To compare the long-term clinical outcomes provided by intra-articular 
injections of either PRP or hyaluronic acid (HA) to treat knee degenerative 
disease.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: Patients with a history of chronic symptomatic knee degenerative 
changes and osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 0-3) were enrolled: 192 
patients were randomized to undergo 3 blinded weekly intra-articular injections 
of either PRP or HA. Patients were prospectively evaluated before the injection 
and then at 2, 6, 12, and 24 months and a mean of 64.3 months (SD, 7.8 months) 
of follow-up. Evaluation was based on International Knee Documentation Committee 
(IKDC) subjective (main outcome), EuroQol visual analog scale, and Tegner 
scores; 167 patients reached the final evaluation.
RESULTS: Both treatments were effective in improving knee functional status and 
symptoms over time: Mean В± SD IKDC subjective score improved significantly for 
both PRP and HA groups ( P < .0005) and remained stable over time up to 24 
months (from 53.3 В± 14.3 to 67.3 В± 18.1 and from 50.3 В± 13.2 to 62.1 В± 20.8 for 
PRP and HA groups, respectively). At final evaluation, a significant IKDC 
reduction was observed in both treatment groups, with the PRP group still 
presenting significantly higher values compared with baseline: PRP 60.5 В± 19.0 ( 
P < .001 vs baseline), HA 55.7 В± 18.8 (not significant vs baseline). A 
comparative analysis showed no significant intergroup difference in any of the 
clinical scores at any follow-up point. The median duration of patient 
subjective perception of symptomatic relief was 9 months for HA and 12 months 
for PRP (not significant). The only significant difference was observed in the 
rate of reintervention at 24 months, which was significantly lower in the PRP 
group (22.6% vs 37.1%, P = .036).
CONCLUSION: Both treatments were effective in improving knee functional status 
and symptoms over time. PRP did not provide an overall superior clinical 
improvement compared with HA in terms of either symptomatic-functional 
improvement at different follow-up points or effect duration.

PURPOSE: To perform a network meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials

METHODS: The literature search was based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting

analysis performed using R. The treatment options were ranked using the P-score.
RESULTS: There were 13 studies (868 patients) included, with 9 studies comparing

associated with obesity that influences the development of chronic-degenerative

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to establish the immunometabolic differences in bariatric 
patients and to determine whether cellular immunity is associated with metabolic 
changes.
METHODOLOGY: We conducted an observational study in patients who underwent 
laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 
(LRYGB). We explored the differences in the immunometabolic profile before and 
after surgery in the study group, by surgical technique, and we evaluated the 
changes in immunological variables as a function of metabolic variables with 
correlation analysis.
RESULTS: The follow-up rate was 88.7%. After the intervention, there were 
changes in cellular immunity, with a decrease in effector T lymphocytes 
(CD8+CD28-) and an increase in B lymphocytes, memory helper T cells, and 
cytotoxic T lymphocytes. LSG resulted in a decrease in (CD4+CD62-) T 
lymphocytes compared with LRYGB. Patients who underwent surgery with LRYGB 
showed clinical and metabolic changes, as well as changes in obesity-associated
