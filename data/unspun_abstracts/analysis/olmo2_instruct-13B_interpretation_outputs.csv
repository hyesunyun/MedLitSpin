254,18237696,Prospective randomized comparison of anatomic single- and double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy",  Focus on (+) secondary endpoint,,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Purpose
To determine if anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is superior to anatomic single-bundle reconstruction in restoring the stabilities and functions of the knee joint.
Methods
A prospective randomized clinical study was done to compare the results of 32 cases of anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction and 34 cases of anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction with average follow-up of 16.3 В± 3.1В months. Tunnel placements of all the cases were measured on 3D CT. Clinical results were collected after reconstruction; graft's appearance, meniscus status and cartilage state under arthroscopy were compared and analysed too.
Results
Tunnel placements, confirmed with 3D CT, were in the anatomic positions as described in literature both in SB and DB group. No differences were found between SB and DB groups in clinical outcome scores, pivot shift test and KT 1000В measurements (average side-to-side difference for anterior tibial translation was 0.7В mm in SB group and 1.0В mm in DB group). More than 70 % of the single-bundle graft and AM bundle graft in DB group appeared excellent, but only 44.1 % of PL bundle grafts in DB group were excellent and 11.8 % were in poor state. No new menisci tear was found either in SB or DB group, however, in DB group cartilage damages in medial patella-femoral joint occurred in 38.2 % cases. This rate was significantly higher than in the SB group which is only 9.3 %.
Conclusion
Both single- and double-bundle anatomic ACL reconstruction can restore the knee's stability and functions very well. However, more incidences of poor PL status and medial patellar-femoral cartilage damage may occur in double-bundle ACL reconstruction.",no_spin,5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -0.7354012727737427, 'probability': 0.47931310534477234}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.003463699948042631, 'probability': 0.9965423345565796}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.0256519317626953, 'probability': 0.3585626184940338}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0042772479355335236, 'probability': 0.9957318902015686}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.2423272132873535, 'probability': 0.2887115478515625}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0037800066638737917, 'probability': 0.9962272047996521}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.0888023376464844, 'probability': 0.33661940693855286}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.003343470161780715, 'probability': 0.9966621398925781}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.2866417169570923, 'probability': 0.27619677782058716}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.002044850494712591, 'probability': 0.9979572296142578}]"

dextrose in normal saline solution compared with normal saline solution will 
lead to a lower proportion of hospitalized patients and a greater reduction in 
serum ketone levels in children with gastroenteritis and dehydration.
METHODS: We enrolled children aged 6 months to 6 years in a double-blind, 
randomized controlled trial of patients presenting to a pediatric emergency 
department. Subjects were randomized to receive a 20 mL/kg infusion of either 5% 
dextrose in normal saline solution or normal saline solution. Serum ketone 
levels were measured before and at 1- and 2-hour intervals after the initial

Methods: In the present prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical study, 30 patients were divided into two groups: 15 patients (group I) were treated with arthroscopy-guided suprascapular nerve block using 10 mL 0.5 % ropivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine, and 15 patients (group II) were treated with placebo using 10 mL 0.9 % saline after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Patient pain levels were measured using the visual analog scale (VAS) at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h post-operatively.

198,23455386,Efficacy of direct arthroscopy-guided suprascapular nerve block after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair: a prospective randomized study.,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy",,Claim benefit based on (+) secondary endpoint,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of arthroscopy-guided direct suprascapular nerve block performed after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

Methods: In the present prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical study, 30 patients were divided into two groups: 15 patients (group I) were treated with arthroscopy-guided suprascapular nerve block using 10 mL 0.5 % ropivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine, and 15 patients (group II) were treated with placebo using 10 mL 0.9 % saline after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Patient pain levels were measured using the visual analog scale (VAS) at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h post-operatively. Additionally, the number of boluses and total amount of fentanyl dispensed by patient-controlled analgesia administration during the 24-h post-operative period were evaluated.

Results: VAS scores did not differ significantly between groups I and II during the 24-h post-operative period, but mean fentanyl bolus consumption was significantly less in group I compared with group II (p = 0.015).

Conclusion: Arthroscopy-guided suprascapular nerve block at the end of a rotator cuff repair was safe and less time-consuming than expected. Although this procedure did not significantly reduce the post-operative pain, the post-operative need for fentanyl boluses as analgesia was reduced significantly, and it would be beneficial if this procedure involved a sensory branch of axillary nerve block or was performed at the beginning of the arthroscopic procedure.",no_spin,7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.0745110511779785, 'probability': 0.34146469831466675}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0019273054786026478, 'probability': 0.9980745911598206}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.8548950552940369, 'probability': 0.4253278374671936}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0003669780562631786, 'probability': 0.9996331334114075}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.0364837646484375, 'probability': 0.35469964146614075}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0004003438516519964, 'probability': 0.9995997548103333}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.4536166191101074, 'probability': 0.2337234616279602}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0016155298799276352, 'probability': 0.9983857870101929}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -1.0385757684707642, 'probability': 0.3539584279060364}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0008133916999213398, 'probability': 0.9991869926452637}]"

Questions/purposes: We (1) compared three-planar component alignment and overall coronal mechanical alignment between PSG and conventional instrumentation and (2) logged the need for applying changes in the suggested position of the PSG.

Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, we enrolled 128 patients. The primary outcome was overall coronal mechanical alignment.

creatinine level of 25% or 0.5 mg/dL, measured 48 to 72 hours after CT.
RESULTS: The data safety and monitoring board terminated the study early for 
futility. Of 399 patients enrolled, 357 (89%) completed follow-up and were 
included. The N-acetylcysteine plus saline solution group contrast-induced 
nephropathy rate was 14 of 185 (7.6%) versus 12 of 172 (7.0%) in the normal 
saline solution only group (absolute risk difference 0.6%; 95% confidence 
interval -4.8% to 6.0%). The contrast-induced nephropathy rate in patients 
receiving less than 1 L intravenous fluids in the emergency department (ED) was 
19 of 147 (12.9%) versus 7 of 210 (3.3%) for greater than 1 L intravenous fluids 
(difference 9.6%; 95% confidence interval 3.7% to 15.5%), a 69% risk reduction 
(odds ratio 0.41; 95% confidence interval 0.21 to 0.80) per liter of intravenous 
fluids.
CONCLUSION: We did not find evidence of a benefit for N-acetylcysteine 
administration to our ED patients undergoing contrast-enhanced CT. However, we 
did find a significant association between volume of intravenous fluids 
administered and reduction in contrast-induced nephropathy.",no_spin,0,0,"[{'token': 15, 'token_string': '0', 'logits': -0.9495047330856323, 'probability': 0.3869325816631317}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0018610315164551139, 'probability': 0.9981406927108765}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.4396376609802246, 'probability': 0.23701362311840057}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0017000283114612103, 'probability': 0.9983014464378357}]",3,3,"[{'token': 18, 'token_string': '3', 'logits': -1.0423085689544678, 'probability': 0.35263964533805847}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.001986198825761676, 'probability': 0.9980157613754272}]",3,3,"[{'token': 18, 'token_string': '3', 'logits': -1.1539764404296875, 'probability': 0.31538018584251404}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0014402027009055018, 'probability': 0.998560905456543}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.1466443538665771, 'probability': 0.3177010715007782}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0007130940794013441, 'probability': 0.9992870688438416}]"

New video-guided airway management technology is available, which may minimize the risk to patients from this procedure.

Methods: This was a controlled clinical trial conducted in the trauma receiving unit in a university-affiliated urban hospital in which 623 consecutive adult patients requiring emergency airway management were prospectively randomized to intubation with either the direct laryngoscope (DL) or the GlideScope video laryngoscope (GVL) device. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes included intubation duration, first-pass success, and incidence of low oxygen saturations.

Results: There was no significant difference in mortality between the GVL group (28 [9%] of 303) and the DL group (24 [8%] of 320) (p = 0.43).

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of the two procedures in patients older than 55 years of age affected by reparable rotator cuff tears with concomitant long head biceps pathologies.

Methods: Patients older than 55 years of age with long head biceps lesions and reparable rotator cuff tears were selected for this study. A total of 151 patients were randomly assigned to the tenotomy group (77 patients) or the tenodesis group (74 patients). Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was performed in all the patients. Before surgery, physical and radiological examinations were performed; the constant score was measured as well. After the operation, the surgical time, cost, pain (VAS scores), Popeye sign, cramping pain, constant scores, satisfaction level and the elbow flexion and forearm supination strength indices were recorded.

Results: Patients were followed for an average of 24 months. No significant differences in the clinical results for the constant scores, the forearm supination and elbow flexion strength indices, Popeye sign, cramping pain and satisfaction level were found between the groups. However, tenotomy required a shorter surgical time (40.4 ± 4.0 vs. 50.4 ± 5.9 min, P < 0.001) and resulted in faster pain relief (3.1 ± 1.8 vs. 4.8 ± 1.9, P < 0.001).

Conclusion: Both tenotomy and tenodesis are effective and equal for the treatment of long head biceps lesions.

However, there are unanswered questions about the performance of hemiarthroplasty over the longer term compared with internal fixation.

Questions/purposes: We sought to compare hemiarthroplasty with internal fixation in terms of (1) outcomes scores for pain, hip function, and quality of life at a minimum of 5 years after surgery in a randomized trial. A secondary purpose was to compare (2) patient survival and (3) frequency of reoperation in the two groups.

Methods: A total of 222 consecutive patients older than 60 years, including those cognitively impaired, with FNF were randomized to either internal fixation with two parallel screws or bipolar hemiarthroplasty. At a minimum followup of 4.9 years (mean, 5.9 years; range, 4.9-7.2 years), 68 of the 70 surviving patients were examined by a study nurse and study physiotherapist blinded to initial treatment. Questionnaires on hip function (Harris hip score), quality of life (Eq5D), and activity of daily living function (Barthel ADL) were administered. The Barthel ADL index score was split into good function (score 95 or 100) and reduced function (score below 95).

Results: The mean survival of the groups was similar with 66.4% (73 of 110) of the patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty and 70.5% (79 of 112) of the patients undergoing internal fixation having died since surgery (p = 0.51). Only 12 of 31 living patients in the internal fixation group had retained their native hips at a mean of 6 years. Between 2 and 6 years, there were two new major reoperations (both in the internal fixation group, for avascular necrosis and deep wound infection). The mean Harris hip score was 66 (SD 19) and 67 (SD 20) in the internal fixation and hemiarthroplasty groups, respectively (p = 0.96). The mean Eq5D index was 0.50 (SD 0.40) in the internal fixation group and 0.34 (SD 0.36) in the hemiarthroplasty group (p = 0.10).

Most MIS TKA surgeons (and many surgeons who use other approaches as well) excise the fat pad for better exposure of the knee. There is still controversy about the result of fat pad excision on patella baja, pain, and function.

Questions/purposes: In the setting of a randomized controlled trial, we sought to determine whether infrapatellar fat pad excision during MIS TKA causes (1) patellar tendon shortening (as measured by patella baja); (2) increased anterior knee pain; (3) decreases in the Knee Society Score or functional subscore; or (4) more patella-related complications.

Methods: We randomized 90 patients undergoing MIS TKA at one institution into two groups. In one group, 45 patients underwent MIS TKA with complete infrapatellar fat pad excision and in the other group, 45 patients received MIS TKA without infrapatellar fat pad excision. The patella was selectively resurfaced in these patients; there was no difference between the groups in terms of the percentage of patients whose patellae were resurfaced. We measured patellar tendon shortening, knee flexion, anterior knee pain, Knee Society Score (KSS), functional subscore, and patellar complications at preoperative and postoperative periods of 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year; complete followup data were available on 86% of patients (77 of 90) who were enrolled.

Results: At the final followup, no significant differences were observed in patellar tendon shortening, KSS, functional subscore, or knee flexion in either group. However, patients with their infrapatellar fat pad excised experienced more anterior knee pain (8.3% versus 0%; p = 0.03; 95% confidence interval, -0.007 to 0.174) at the end of the study. No patellar complications were found in either group.

recommended as a safe, effective alternative to epidural analgesia plus 
single-injection FNB after TKA. Improved analgesic efficacy in the group that 
received epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB must be weighed against 
the disadvantage of a higher likelihood of knee buckling and delayed ambulation 
with that treatment approach.

because of their ability to engage the reader. Our objective was to evaluate the 
effectiveness of story booklets compared to standard information sheets for 
parents of children attending the emergency department (ED) with a child with

METHODS: Parents were randomized to receive story booklets (n=208) or standard 
information sheets (n=205) during their ED visit. The primary outcome was change 
in anxiety between triage to ED discharge as measured by the State-Trait Anxiety 
Inventory. Follow-up telephone interviews were conducted at 1 and 3 days after 
discharge, then every other day until 9 days (or until resolution of symptoms), 
and at 1 year. Secondary outcomes included: expected future anxiety, event 
impact, parental knowledge, satisfaction, decision regret, healthcare 
utilization, time to symptom resolution.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the primary outcome of change in 
parental anxiety between recruitment and ED discharge (change of 5 points for 
the story group vs. 6 points for the comparison group, p=0.78). The story group 
showed significantly greater decision regret regarding their decision to go to

METHODS: We conducted an randomized controlled trial of 128 adult patients with 
poorly controlled diabetes (glycosylated hemoglobin [Hb A1C] level в‰Ґ8%) in an

disruptive to patients and families, and associated with considerable cost to 
the health service. Improved patient experience and cost reductions could be 
realised by providing cost-effective crisis planning services.
METHODS: Economic evaluation within a multi-centre randomised controlled trial 
comparing Joint Crisis Plans (JCP) plus treatment as usual (TAU) to TAU alone 
for patients aged over 16, with at least one psychiatric hospital admission in 
the previous two years and on the Enhanced Care Programme Approach register. 
JCPs, containing the patient's treatment preferences for any future psychiatric 
emergency, are a form of crisis intervention that aim to mitigate the negative 
consequences of relapse, including hospital admission and use of coercion. Data 
were collected at baseline and 18-months after randomisation. The primary 
outcome was admission to hospital under the Mental Health Act. The economic 
evaluation took a service perspective (health, social care and criminal justice 
services) and a societal perspective (additionally including criminal activity 
and productivity losses).
FINDINGS: The addition of JCPs to TAU had no significant effect on compulsory 
admissions or total societal cost per participant over 18-months follow-up. From 
the service cost perspective, however, evidence suggests a higher probability 
(80%) of JCPs being the more cost-effective option. Exploration by ethnic group 
highlights distinct patterns of costs and effects. Whilst the evidence does not 
support the cost-effectiveness of JCPs for White or Asian ethnic groups, there 
is at least a 90% probability of the JCP intervention being the more 
cost-effective option in the Black ethnic group.
INTERPRETATION: The results by ethnic group are sufficiently striking to warrant 
further investigation into the potential for patient gain from JCPs among black 
patient groups.",no_spin,5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -0.9579496383666992, 'probability': 0.38367876410484314}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.000302745756926015, 'probability': 0.9996973276138306}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.8901867866516113, 'probability': 0.41057902574539185}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0005199749139137566, 'probability': 0.9994801878929138}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.3306788206100464, 'probability': 0.2642977833747864}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0012254356406629086, 'probability': 0.9987753629684448}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.04623544216156, 'probability': 0.3512575924396515}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.00028713393840007484, 'probability': 0.9997128248214722}]",10,10,"[{'token': 605, 'token_string': '10', 'logits': -1.1315141916275024, 'probability': 0.32254448533058167}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0002057340752799064, 'probability': 0.9997943043708801}]"

Although positive effects were found after physiotherapy, the recurrence and prolonged disability of a frozen shoulder are major factors to focus on to provide the appropriate treatment.

Questions/purposes: We wished to study the effectiveness of a shoulder countertraction apparatus on ROM, pain, and function in patients with a frozen shoulder and compare their results with those of control subjects who received conventional physiotherapy.

Methods: A total of 100 participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group and a control group, with each group having 50 participants. The control group received physiotherapy and the experimental group received countertraction and physiotherapy. The total treatment time was 20 minutes a day for 5 days per week for 2 weeks.

Results: Improvements were seen in the scores for shoulder flexion (94.1Ў ± 19.79Ў at baseline increased to 161.9Ў ± 13.05Ў after intervention), abduction ROM (90.4Ў ± 21.18Ў at baseline increased to 154.8Ў ± 13.21Ў after intervention), and pain (8.00 ± 0.78 at baseline decreased to 3.48 ± 0.71 after intervention) in the experimental group.

Methods: Between January 2007 and January 2011, 87 patients who underwent arthroscopic Bankart repair with the use of knot-tying suture anchors or knotless suture anchors were evaluated, with 45 patients in the knot-tying suture group and 42 patients in the knotless group. Patients were assigned to either group, with odd-numbered patients going to the knot-tying suture arm and even-numbered patients assigned to the knotless arm. Outcomes included the Constant score, the visual analog scale (VAS) score, patient satisfaction score, and range of motion in forward flexion and external rotation with the arm in adduction. Redislocations or subluxations with the 2 techniques was also studied.

Results: Both groups showed a statistically significant improvement between the preoperative and postoperative VAS scores and Constant scores. In the knot-tying suture group, the VAS score improved from 2.5 ± 2.3 to 0.7 ± 0.5 (P < .05) and the Constant score improved from 64 ± 7 to 92 ± 10 (P < .05). In the knotless group, the VAS score improved from 2.8 ± 2.5 to 0.9 ± 0.6 (P < .05), and the Constant score improved from 62 ± 6 to 89 ± 9 (P < .05). The patient satisfaction scores were 6.9 and 7.1 for the knot tying and knotless groups, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found when comparing the outcomes between the 2 groups. The change in the range of forward flexion and external rotation was also similar in the 2 groups. There was also no difference in recurrence or redislocation rates.

Conclusions: Both the knot-tying and knotless suture anchors groups showed statistically significant and similar improvement in VAS and Constant scores. Both anchors provided reasonable outcomes.

However, recent basic science and clinical data have suggested recurrent instability may be reduced with immobilization in external rotation after primary shoulder dislocation.

Questions/purposes: We performed a randomized controlled trial to compare the (1) frequency of recurrent instability and (2) disease-specific quality-of-life scores after treatment of first-time shoulder dislocation using either immobilization in external rotation or immobilization in internal rotation in a group of young patients.

Methods: Sixty patients younger than 35 years of age with primary, traumatic, anterior shoulder dislocations were randomized (concealed, computer-generated) to immobilization with either an internal rotation sling (n = 29) or an external rotation brace (n = 31) at a mean of 4 days after closed reduction (range, 1-7 days). Patients with large bony lesions or polytrauma were excluded. The two groups were similar at baseline. Both groups were immobilized for 4 weeks with identical therapy protocols thereafter. Blinded assessments were completed by independent observers for a minimum of 12 months (mean, 25 months; range, 12-43 months).

PURPOSE: To report the short-term clinical outcomes of patients undergoing 
arthroscopic repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears with and without 
acromioplasty.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: Patients undergoing arthroscopic repair of full-thickness rotator cuff 
tears were randomized into acromioplasty or nonacromioplasty groups. The primary 
outcome was the Simple Shoulder Test (SST). Secondary outcomes included American 
Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, Constant score, University of

kinetic chain resistance training on anterior knee laxity and function in the 
ACL-injured (ACLI) knee.
METHODS: Fifty-eight ACLI subjects were randomised to one of three (12-week 
duration) training groups. The STAND group trained according to a standardised 
rehabilitation protocol. Subjects in the LOW and HIGH group trained as did the 
STAND group but with the addition of seated knee extensor open kinetic chain 
resistance training at loads of 2 sets of 20 repetition maximum (RM) and 20 sets 
of 2RM, respectively. Anterior knee laxity and measurements of physical and 
subjective function were performed at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks. Thirty-six 
subjects were tested at both baseline and 12 weeks (STAND n = 13, LOW n = 11, 
HIGH n = 12).
RESULTS: The LOW group demonstrated a reduction in 133 N anterior knee laxity 
between baseline and 12 weeks testing when compared to the HIGH and the STAND 
groups (p = 0.009). Specifically, the trained-untrained knee laxity decreased an 
average of approximately 5 mm in the LOW group while remaining the same in the 
other two groups.
CONCLUSION: Twelve weeks of knee extensor open kinetic chain resistance training 
at loads of 2 sets of 20RM led to a reduction in anterior knee laxity in the 
ACLI knee. This reduction in laxity does not appear to offer any significant 
short-term functional advantages when compared to a standard rehabilitation

METHODS: Ninety patients undergoing primary TKA were involved and randomly 
allocated to the TENS or control group. In the TENS group, electrical 
stimulation of the common fibular nerve, which produced a brisk dorsiflexion of 
the ankle, was performed for the operated leg during surgery. In the control

RESULTS: The incidence of DVT was 11% (5/45 cases) in the TENS group and 31% (14/45 cases) in the control group (p = 0.02). Immediately after surgery, D-dimer and SFMC levels were lower in the TENS group compared with control (p < 0.05). There were no adverse effects related to TENS.

develop during total joint arthroplasty. Previously, we reported effective 
prevention of venous stasis by transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation

limb undergoing surgery. The purpose of this study is to clarify the clinical 
efficacy and safety of TENS in patients during total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
METHODS: Ninety patients undergoing primary TKA were involved and randomly

stimulation of the common fibular nerve, which produced a brisk dorsiflexion of

Sustaining muscle pump activation during surgery prevented not only venous

navigation enables intraoperative control of leg length equalization and offset 
reconstruction. However, the effect of navigation compared with intraoperative 
fluoroscopy is unclear.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether intraoperative use of imageless navigation 
(1) improves the relative accuracy of leg length and global and femoral offset 
restoration; (2) increases the absolute precision of leg length and global and 
femoral offset equalization; and (3) reduces outliers in a reconstruction zone 
of В± 5 mm for leg length and global and femoral offset restoration compared with 
intraoperative fluoroscopy during minimally invasive (MIS) THA with the patient 
in a lateral decubitus position.
METHODS: In this prospective study a consecutive series of 125 patients were 
randomized to either navigation-guided or fluoroscopy-controlled THA using 
sealed, opaque envelopes. All patients received the same cementless prosthetic 
components through an anterolateral MIS approach while they were in a lateral 
decubitus position. Leg length, global or total offset (representing the 
combination of femoral and acetabular offset), and femoral offset differences 
were restored using either navigation or fluoroscopy. Postoperatively, residual 
leg length and global and femoral offset discrepancies were analyzed on 
magnification-corrected radiographs of the pelvis by an independent and blinded 
examiner using digital planning software. Accuracy was defined as the relative 
postoperative difference between the surgically treated and the unaffected 
contralateral side for leg length and offset, respectively; precision was 
defined as the absolute postoperative deviation of leg length and global and 
femoral offset regardless of lengthening or shortening of leg length and offset 
throughout the THA. All analyses were performed per intention-to-treat.
RESULTS: Analyzing the relative accuracy of leg length restoration we found a 
mean difference of 0.2 mm (95% CI, -1.0 to +1.4 mm; p = 0.729) between 
fluoroscopy and navigation, 0.2 mm (95 % CI, -0.9 to +1.3 mm; p = 0.740) for 
global offset and 1.7 mm (95 % CI, +0.4 to +2.9 mm; p = 0.008) for femoral

equalization, there was a mean difference of 1.7 В± 0.3 mm (p < 0.001) between 
fluoroscopy and navigation. The biomechanical reconstruction with a residual leg 
length and global and femoral offset discrepancy less than 5 mm and less than 8

METHODS: In a multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial of redback spider 
antivenom for latrodectism, 224 patients (>7 years) with a redback spider bite 
and severe pain, with or without systemic effects, were randomized to receive 
normal saline solution (placebo) or antivenom after receiving standardized 
analgesia. The primary outcome was a clinically significant reduction in pain 2 
hours after trial medication compared with baseline. A second primary outcome 
was resolution of systemic features at 2 hours. Secondary outcomes were improved pain at 4 and 24 
hours, resolution of systemic features at 4 hours, administration of opioid 
analgesics or unblinded antivenom after 2 hours, and adverse reactions.
RESULTS: Two hours after treatment, 26 of 112 patients (23%) from the placebo 
arm had a clinically significant improvement in pain versus 38 of 112 (34%) from 
the antivenom arm (difference in favor of antivenom 10.7%; 95% confidence 
interval -1.1% to 22.6%; P=.10). Systemic effects resolved after 2 hours in 9 of 
41 patients (22%) in the placebo arm and 9 of 35 (26%) in the antivenom arm 
(difference 3.8%; 95% confidence interval -15% to 23%; P=.79). There was no 
significant difference in any secondary outcome between antivenom and placebo. 
Acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 4 of 112 patients (3.6%) 
receiving antivenom.

Intravenous morphine has been used as a common method of pain control in emergency care. NebulizedВ fentanylВ is also an effective temporary substitute. This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of nebulized fentanyl with intravenous (IV) morphine on management of acute limb pain.
Methods
This was a placebo-controlled, double-blindВ randomized clinical trial. Ninety emergency department patients with moderate to severe pain aged 15 to 50 years were blocked randomized and enrolled in this study. Forty-seven patients in the experimental group received nebulized fentanyl (4В Ојg/kg) and IV normal saline as placebo, and the remaining 43 patients in the control group received IV morphine (0.1 mg/kg) and nebulized normal saline as placebo. All participants' pain scores were assessed by Numerical Rating Scale before and after intervention at 5-, 10-, 15-, 30-, 45-, and 60-minute intervals. Patients' vital sign and possibleВ adverse effectsВ were recorded respectively. Finally, all participants were assessed for their satisfaction.
Results
The mean initial pain score in the experimental group was 8.7 and 8.4 in the control group (PВ = .1). Pain relief in both groups after 5 and 10 minutes were similar (PВ = .72). Although the pain relief was significantly greater with fentanyl at 15 minutes, this difference is not clinically significant. Pain management in both groups was successful and was more than 3 scores reduction in Numerical Rating Scale. Patient satisfaction in both groups was similar.

82,25182544,"Ecallantide for the acute treatment of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema: a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial.",Annals of Emergency Medicine,RESULTS: Focus on (+) subgroup analysis,,Emergency Medicine,claude_4.0-sonnet,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: We compare the safety and efficacy of ecallantide with placebo 
in subjects undergoing assessment for acute angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitor-induced angioedema (ACEIA) in an emergency department (ED).
METHODS: This was a multicenter, phase 2, double-blind study with subjects 
randomized to receive a single subcutaneous dose of ecallantide (10, 30, or 60 
mg) or placebo plus physician-directed conventional therapy. The primary 
endpoint was defined as meeting predetermined discharge eligibility criteria 
within 6 hours of study drug administration. Discharge criteria included 
improvement of edema, stable vital signs, absence of stridor, absence of dyspnea 
or use of accessory muscles during respiration, absence of drooling, and ability 
to drink without difficulty.
RESULTS: An interim analysis showed that a high percentage of subjects met the 
primary endpoint, and the study was halted. Overall, 79 subjects were randomized 
and 76 had data for analysis. Most had mild (45%) or moderate (42%) ACEIA. The 
discharge eligibility endpoint was met by 72% of the placebo group and 85%, 89%, 
and 89% of the ecallantide 10-, 30-, and 60-mg groups, respectively. This 
difference in meeting discharge eligibility endpoint criteria between treatment 
groups was not statistically significant. The incidence of treatment-emergent 
adverse events was similar between placebo and active-treatment groups.
CONCLUSION: The addition of ecallantide to standard therapy does not appear to 
improve angioedema compared with placebo in ED patients with ACEIA. Our data 
suggest that most ED patients presenting with mild to moderate ACEIA are likely 
to meet our discharge eligibility criteria within 6 hours of treatment,

in subjects undergoing assessment for acute angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitor-induced angioedema (ACEIA) in an emergency department (ED).
METHODS: This was a multicenter, phase 2, double-blind study with subjects 
randomized to receive a single subcutaneous dose of ecallantide (10, 30, or 60 
mg) or placebo plus physician-directed conventional therapy. The primary 
endpoint was defined as meeting predetermined discharge eligibility criteria 
within 6 hours of study drug administration. Discharge criteria included 
improvement of edema, stable vital signs, absence of stridor, absence of dyspnea 
or use of accessory muscles during respiration, absence of drooling, and ability 
to drink without difficulty.
RESULTS: An interim analysis showed that a high percentage of subjects met the 
primary endpoint, and the study was halted. Overall, 79 subjects were randomized 
and 76 had data for analysis. Most had mild (45%) or moderate (42%) ACEIA. The 
discharge eligibility endpoint was met by 72% of the placebo group and 85%, 89%, 
and 89% of the ecallantide 10-, 30-, and 60-mg groups, respectively. This 
difference in meeting discharge eligibility endpoint criteria between treatment 
groups was not statistically significant. The incidence of treatment-emergent 
adverse events was similar between placebo and active-treatment groups.

METHODS: The study randomly allocated 32 patients (13 women), mean age 63 years 
(range, 39-82 years), with shoulder osteoarthritis to a Copeland (n = 14) or 
Global C.A.P. (n = 18) HHRI. Patients were monitored for 2 years with 
radiostereometry, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, Constant Shoulder Score

was measured preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively.
RESULTS: At 2 years, total translation (TT) was 0.48 mm (standard deviation

(Biomet Inc, Warsaw, IN, USA) and the Global C.A.P. (DePuy Int, Warsaw, IN, USA) 
humeral head resurfacing implants (HHRIs).
METHODS: The study randomly allocated 32 patients (13 women), mean age 63 years 
(range, 39-82 years), with shoulder osteoarthritis to a Copeland (n = 14) or 
Global C.A.P. (n = 18) HHRI. The primary outcome was implant migration measured 
by total translation (TT). Secondary outcomes included bone mineral density, 
length of glenohumeral offset, Constant Shoulder Score (CSS), and the Western 
Ontario Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder Index (WOOS). Patients were monitored for 
2 years with radiostereometry, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, CSS, and WOOS. 
LGHO was measured preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively.
RESULTS: At 2 years, total translation (TT) was 0.48 mm (standard deviation 
[SD], 0.21 mm) for the Copeland and 0.82 mm (SD, 0.46 mm) for the Global C.A.P. 
(P = .06). Five HHRI were revised. Periprosthetic BMD decreased initially but 
increased continuously after 6 months for both HHRIs. At 2 years, BMD was 48% 
higher around the Copeland HHRI (P = .005). The mean difference in LGHO was 
significantly higher for the Copeland than for the Global C.A.P. HHRI (P = .02). 
Clinical results evaluated with CSS and WOOS improved over time for both implant 
groups (P < .01), with no differences between the groups.
CONCLUSION: The Copeland HHRI was not more effective than the Global C.A.P. HHRI 
on implant migration in patients with shoulder osteoarthritis.",spin,5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -0.5813267827033997, 'probability': 0.5591560006141663}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.00043442347669042647, 'probability': 0.9995657205581665}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.09951913356781, 'probability': 0.33303117752075195}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0013067525578662753, 'probability': 0.9986941814422607}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -0.7780085802078247, 'probability': 0.4593197703361511}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.00028951745480298996, 'probability': 0.9997105002403259}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -0.8363085389137268, 'probability': 0.43330708146095276}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0008596062543801963, 'probability': 0.9991406798362732}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.0158499479293823, 'probability': 0.36209455132484436}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0003632839070633054, 'probability': 0.9996367692947388}]"

previous year. Subjects received 1 intravenous infusion of placebo (n = 38) or 
benralizumab (0.3 mg/kg, n = 36 or 1.0 mg/kg, n = 36) added to outpatient 
management. The primary outcome was the proportion of subjects with greater than 
or equal to 1 exacerbation at 12 weeks in placebo vs the combined benralizumab 
groups. Other outcomes included the time-weighted rate of exacerbations at week 
12, adverse events, blood eosinophil counts, asthma symptom changes, and health 
care resource utilization.
RESULTS: The proportion of subjects with greater than or equal to 1 asthma 
exacerbation at 12 weeks was not different between placebo and the combined 
benralizumab groups (38.9% vs 33.3%; P = .67). However, compared with placebo, 
benralizumab reduced asthma exacerbation rates by 49% (3.59 vs 1.82; P = .01) 
and exacerbations resulting in hospitalization by 60% (1.62 vs 0.65; P = .02) in 
the combined groups. Benralizumab reduced blood eosinophil counts but did not 
affect other outcomes, while demonstrating an acceptable safety profile.

METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial 
evaluating bupivacaine anesthesia of the sphenopalatine ganglion for acute 
anterior or global-based headache. This study was completed in 2 large academic 
EDs. Bupivacaine or normal saline solution was delivered intranasally (0.3 mL

minutes by a 100-mm visual analog scale. The primary endpoint was a 50% 
reduction in pain at 15 minutes. Telephone follow-up assessed 24-hour pain and

the rotator cuff (RC) tear has not been well clarified.
PURPOSE: To compare the clinical results between patients who had distal 
clavicle resection (DCR) and those who did not during RC repair.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: From August 2008 to December 2009, a total of 56 consecutive patients 
(58 shoulders) were included. All patients had either a full-thickness or 
high-grade (>50%) RC tear, ACJ tenderness, arthritic change visible on plain 
radiographs, and a positive ACJ lidocaine injection test the day before surgery. 
Patients were randomized into 2 groups: DCR and RC repair (DCR+RCR group) and RC 
repair only (isolated RCR). Evaluation was performed preoperatively, at 6 months 
postoperatively, and at a final follow-up a minimum of 24 months postoperatively 
using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, the Constant 
shoulder score, range of motion examination, and pain visual analog scale (VAS).
RESULTS: After simple randomization, 26 shoulders were allocated in the DCR+RCR 
group, and 32 were placed in the isolated RCR group. Five shoulders in the 
DCR+RCR group and 6 in the isolated RCR group were excluded from analysis due to 
loss of follow-up. Therefore, the evaluation was performed for 21 shoulders in 
the DCR+RCR group and 26 shoulders in the isolated RCR group. The mean follow-up

group. There were no differences in age, sex, symptom duration, RC tear size, or 
preoperative ASES, Constant, and VAS scores between the 2 groups (P > .05). At 
final follow-up, the ASES, Constant, and VAS scores were significantly improved

the rotator cuff (RC) tear has not been well clarified.
PURPOSE: To compare the clinical results between patients who had distal 
clavicle resection (DCR) and those who did not during RC repair.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: From August 2008 to December 2009, a total of 56 consecutive patients 
(58 shoulders) were included. All patients had either a full-thickness or 
high-grade (>50%) RC tear, ACJ tenderness, arthritic change visible on plain 
radiographs, and a positive ACJ lidocaine injection test the day before surgery. 
Patients were randomized into 2 groups: DCR and RC repair (DCR+RCR group) and RC 
repair only (isolated RCR). The primary outcome was the American Shoulder and 
Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score. Secondary outcomes included the Constant shoulder 
score, range of motion examination, and pain visual analog scale (VAS). 
Evaluation was performed preoperatively, at 6 months postoperatively, and at a 
final follow-up a minimum of 24 months postoperatively.
RESULTS: After simple randomization, 26 shoulders were allocated in the DCR+RCR 
group, and 32 were placed in the isolated RCR group. Five shoulders in the 
DCR+RCR group and 6 in the isolated RCR group were excluded from analysis due to 
loss of follow-up. Therefore, the evaluation was performed for 21 shoulders in 
the DCR+RCR group and 26 shoulders in the isolated RCR group. The mean follow-up 
period was 44.2 months in the DCR+RCR group and 44.0 months in the isolated RCR 
group. There were no differences in age, sex, symptom duration, RC tear size, or 
preoperative ASES, Constant, and VAS scores between the 2 groups (P > .05). At 
final follow-up, there were no differences in ASES, Constant, and VAS scores 
between the 2 groups (P > .05), and there was no difference in residual ACJ 
tenderness (7 in the DCR+RCR group and 5 in the isolated RCR group) between the 
2 groups (P = .270).

Delayed initiation of neuroprotective agents has hindered earlier phase 3 trials of neuroprotective agents.

Methods: We randomly assigned patients with suspected stroke to receive either intravenous magnesium sulfate or placebo, beginning within 2 hours after symptom onset. A loading dose was initiated by paramedics before the patient arrived at the hospital, and a 24-hour maintenance infusion was started on the patient's arrival at the hospital. The primary outcome was the degree of disability at 90 days, as measured by scores on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater disability).

Results: Among the 1700 enrolled patients (857 in the magnesium group and 843 in the placebo group), the mean (±SD) age was 69±13 years, 42.6% were women, and the mean pretreatment score on the Los Angeles Motor Scale of stroke severity (range, 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater motor deficits) was 3.7±1.3. The final diagnosis of the qualifying event was cerebral ischemia in 73.3% of patients, intracranial hemorrhage in 22.8%, and a stroke-mimicking condition in 3.9%. The median interval between the time the patient was last known to be free of stroke symptoms and the start of the study-drug infusion was 45 minutes (interquartile range, 35 to 62), and 74.3% of patients received the study-drug infusion within the first hour after symptom onset. There was no significant shift in the distribution of 90-day disability outcomes on the global modified Rankin scale between patients in the magnesium group and those in the placebo group (P=0.28 by the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test); mean scores at 90 days did not differ between the magnesium group and the placebo group (2.7 in each group, P=1.00). No significant between-group differences were noted with respect to mortality (15.4% in the magnesium group and 15.5% in the placebo group, P=0.95) or all serious adverse events.

Delayed initiation of neuroprotective agents has hindered earlier phase 3 trials of neuroprotective agents.

Methods: We randomly assigned patients with suspected stroke to receive either intravenous magnesium sulfate or placebo, beginning within 2 hours after symptom onset. A loading dose was initiated by paramedics before the patient arrived at the hospital, and a 24-hour maintenance infusion was started on the patient's arrival at the hospital. The primary outcome was the degree of disability at 90 days, as measured by scores on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater disability).

Results: Among the 1700 enrolled patients (857 in the magnesium group and 843 in the placebo group), the mean (±SD) age was 69±13 years, 42.6% were women, and the mean pretreatment score on the Los Angeles Motor Scale of stroke severity (range, 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater motor deficits) was 3.7±1.3.

To increase the likelihood that good alignment will be achieved during surgery, smart tools such as robotics or patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) have been introduced.
Questions/purposes:В We hypothesized that UKA performed with PSI would result in improved level gait as ascertained with three-dimensional analysis, implant positioning, and patient-reported outcomes measured by a validated scoring system when compared with conventional instrumentation 3 months and 1 year after surgery.
Methods:В We randomized 60 patients into two groups using either the PSI technique or a conventional technique. All patients were operated on using the same technique and the same cemented metal-backed implant. Mean age of the patients was 63 В± 4 years (range, 54-72 years) and mean body mass index was 28 В± 3 kg/m(2). Patients were evaluated preoperatively, at 3 months, and 1 year after surgery by an independent observer blind to the type of technique. Gait parameters were assessed with three-dimensional analysis during level walking preoperatively and at 1 year, frontal and sagittal position of the implant was evaluated on full-length radiographs at 3 months, and subjective functional outcome and quality of life using routine questionnaires (SF-12, new Knee Society Score [KSS], Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) at 3 months and 1 year. This study had 80% power to detect a 15% difference in walking speed at the p < 0.05 level.
Results:В One year after surgery, there were no differences between the two groups in the analyzed gait spatiotemporal parameters, respectively, for PSI UKA and conventional UKA : double limb support 31% (25%-54%) versus 30% (23%-56%; p = 0.67) and walking speed (1.59 m/s [0.86-1.87 m/s] versus 1.57 m/s [0.71-1.96 m/s]; p = 0.41). No difference was observed between the two groups in terms of lower limb alignment (PSI group 178В° В± 3В°, conventional group 178В° В± 4В°; p = 0.24) or implant positioning on mediolateral and anteroposterior radiographs. There were no differences in the functional score between the PSI and conventional TKA groups at 3 months and 1 year after surgery: KSS objective knee scores (PSI: 85 В± 8 points at 3 months, 87 В± 5 points at 1 year and conventional instrumentation: 82 В± 8 points at 3 months 83 В± 6 points at 1 year; p = 0.10) and functional activity scores were similar in both group (PSI: 71 В± 12 points at 3 months and 74 В± 7 points at 1 year versus conventional group: 73 В± 11 points at 3 months and 75 В± 6 at 1 year; p = 0.9).

METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial evaluating ED 
patients aged 18 to 55 years and experiencing moderate to severe acute 
abdominal, flank, or musculoskeletal pain, defined as a numeric rating scale

METHODS: One hundred and twenty consecutive patients with varus malalignment and

children at risk for serious bacterial infections (SBI) attending the emergency 
department (ED).
METHODS: Randomized controlled trial with 439 febrile children, aged 1 month-16 
years, attending the pediatric ED of a Dutch university hospital during 
2010-2012. Febrile children were randomly assigned to the intervention (clinical 
decision model; n = 219) or the control group (usual care; n = 220). The 
clinical decision model included clinical symptoms, vital signs, and C-reactive 
protein and provided high/low-risks for ""pneumonia"" and ""other SBI"". Nurses were 
guided by the intervention to initiate additional tests for high-risk children. 
The clinical decision model was evaluated by 1)

discriminative ability and 2) feasibility, to measure nurses' compliance to 
model recommendations. Primary patient outcome was defined as correct SBI 
diagnoses. Secondary process outcomes were defined as length of stay; diagnostic 
tests; antibiotic treatment; hospital admission; revisits and medical costs.
RESULTS: The decision model had discriminative ability for both pneumonia

compare the outcome of non-lateralized versus lateralized RSA with particular 
regard to rotational function in patients with CTA.
METHODS: Thirty-four patients underwent implantation of RSA either with

outcomes were stone expulsion on CT at 28 days and time to stone expulsion.
RESULTS: There were 403 patients randomized, 81.4% were men, and the median age 
was 46 years. The median stone size was 4.0 mm in the tamsulosin group and 3.7 
mm in the placebo group. Of 316 patients who received CT at 28 days, stone 
passage occurred in 140 of 161 (87.0%) in the tamsulosin group and 127 of 155 
(81.9%) with placebo, a difference of 5.0% (95% confidence interval -3.0% to 
13.0%). In a prespecified subgroup analysis of large stones (5 to 10 mm), 30 of 
36 (83.3%) tamsulosin participants had stone passage compared with 25 of 41 
(61.0%) with placebo, a difference of 22.4% (95% confidence interval 3.1% to 
41.6%) and number needed to treat of 4.5. There was no difference in urologic 
interventions, time to self-reported stone passage, pain, or analgesia 
requirements. Adverse events were generally mild and did not differ between 
groups.
CONCLUSION: We found no benefit overall of 0.4 mg of tamsulosin daily for 
patients with distal ureteric calculi less than or equal to 10 mm in terms of 
spontaneous passage, time to stone passage, pain, or analgesia requirements. In 
the subgroup with large stones (5 to 10 mm), tamsulosin did increase passage and 
should be considered.",no_spin,5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -0.8911651968955994, 'probability': 0.4101775586605072}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.006548611912876368, 'probability': 0.9934728741645813}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.6658922433853149, 'probability': 0.5138148665428162}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0026423560921102762, 'probability': 0.9973611235618591}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.2707345485687256, 'probability': 0.2806254029273987}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.004773648921400309, 'probability': 0.9952377080917358}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.0093872547149658, 'probability': 0.36444219946861267}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.002534393919631839, 'probability': 0.997468888759613}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.4379289150238037, 'probability': 0.23741896450519562}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0021828413009643555, 'probability': 0.9978196024894714}]"

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: From June 2002 to August 2003, patients with a symptomatic 
ACL-deficient knee were randomized to receive either a hamstring autograft or

of intra-articular hip disorders. While most arthroscopic hip procedures are 
performed as outpatient surgeries, patients can still experience significant 
postoperative pain and opioid-associated side effects.
PURPOSE: The potential benefits of a preoperative femoral nerve block (FNB) in 
hip arthroscopy were explored in a previous retrospective review. The study 
objective was to confirm these findings in a prospective randomized study.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: Fifty patients undergoing hip arthroscopy were included in this 
prospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial that was patient-, 
operator-, and assessor-blinded. Patients received either a preoperative 
ultrasound-guided FNB with 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine (FNB group) or normal 
saline (control group). Nerve blockade was confirmed via standardized sensory 
testing before the induction of general anesthesia. The primary endpoint was 
cumulative consumption of oral morphine equivalent at 24 hours after discharge. 
Secondary endpoints included opioid use at various time points, pain scores, 
Quality of Recovery (QoR-27) score, incidence of nausea and vomiting, time to 
discharge, block-related complications, falls at 24 hours, and patient 
satisfaction.
RESULTS: Fifty patients completed the study, including 27 in the FNB group and 
23 in the control group. Most patient characteristics were statistically similar 
between groups except for operative time, which was longer in the control group. 
Cumulative oral morphine consumption was lower in the FNB group at 48 hours; 
there was no difference at 24 hours or 7 days postoperatively. Pain scores were 
significantly lower up to 6 hours postoperatively in the FNB group compared with 
control; however, rebound pain was observed at 24 hours after discharge in 
patients who received FNB. There was no difference in most secondary outcomes. 
Importantly, a total of 6 patients in the FNB group reported falls (without 
injury) within the first 24 hours postoperatively compared with none in the 
control group. Patient satisfaction with pain control was high in both groups at 
all time points.

However, there are few well-designed studies comparing approaches to treatment.

Questions/purposes: (1) Which treatment (compression bandaging with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], aspiration, or aspiration with steroid injections) is associated with the highest likelihood of resolution of nonseptic olecranon bursitis? (2) Which treatment is associated with earliest resolution of symptoms? (3) What factors are associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks?

Methods: We enrolled 133 patients from two centers; after applying prespecified exclusions (septic bursitis or concomitant inflammatory arthritis, intraarticular elbow pathology, recent aspiration or steroid injection done elsewhere, and refusal to participate), 90 patients were randomly allocated to receive compression bandaging with NSAIDs (C), aspiration (A), or aspiration with steroid injection (AS) groups (30 patients in each). The groups were similar at baseline in terms of age and gender. Seven patients (four from Group A and three from Group AS) were lost to followup. All patients were followed up weekly for 4 weeks, and the same treatment procedure was repeated if the bursitis recurred with any substantial fluid collection. At 4 weeks, the state of resolution and pain visual analog scale (VAS) were evaluated. Failed resolution was defined as presence of persistent olecranon bursal fluid collection at Week 4 after the initiation of the treatment; on the contrary, if bursal fluid collection was clinically reduced or completely disappeared by the end of Week 4, the treatment was considered successful. We compared the proportion of resolution by Week 4 and the median times to resolution among the treatment groups. In addition, we evaluated whether the resolution affected pain VAS and what factors were associated with the resolution.

Results: There were no differences in the proportion of patients whose bursitis resolved by Week 4 among the three treatment groups (Group C: 25 of 30 [83%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.27-1.72], p = 0.580; Group A: 17 of 26 [65%], relative risk of resolution failure: 2.19 [95% CI, 0.98-4.87], p = 0.083; Group AS: 23 of 27 [85%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.59 [95% CI, 0.22-1.63], p = 0.398) (p = 0.073). Steroid injection after aspiration (Group AS) was associated with the earliest resolution (2.3 weeks [range, 1-4 weeks]) when compared with aspiration alone (Group A; 3.1 weeks [range, 2-4 weeks]) and compression bandaging with NSAIDs (Group C; 3.2 weeks [range, 2-4 weeks]), p = 0.015). Longer duration of symptoms before treatment was the only factor associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks (failed resolution: 6 weeks [range, 2-9 weeks]; successful resolution: 4 weeks [range, 0.4-6 weeks]; p = 0.008).

Conclusions: With the numbers available, there were no differences in efficacy when compression bandaging with NSAIDs, aspiration, and aspiration with steroid injection were compared. However, we were powered only to detect a 30% difference, meaning that if there were a smaller difference in efficacy among the groups, we might not have detected it in a study of this size. Our data can be used as pilot data to power future prospective (and likely multicenter) trials. Because olecranon bursitis can recur, and because treatments like aspiration and aspiration with steroid injection can cause complications, unless future trials demonstrate clear efficacy advantages of aspiration and/or injection both at short and longer terms, we suggest that compression bandaging and a short course of NSAIDs may offer the most appropriate balance of safety and efficacy.",no_spin,5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -0.8906490802764893, 'probability': 0.4103892743587494}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0006810491322539747, 'probability': 0.9993191361427307}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.276143193244934, 'probability': 0.27911171317100525}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0019061268540099263, 'probability': 0.9980956315994263}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.0105005502700806, 'probability': 0.3640367090702057}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0007133323233574629, 'probability': 0.9992868900299072}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.1218931674957275, 'probability': 0.3256627023220062}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0010562323732301593, 'probability': 0.9989443421363831}]",10,10,"[{'token': 605, 'token_string': '10', 'logits': -0.8757855296134949, 'probability': 0.4165346920490265}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0005492847412824631, 'probability': 0.9994508028030396}]"

However, there are few well-designed studies comparing approaches to treatment.

Questions/purposes: (1) Which treatment (compression bandaging with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], aspiration, or aspiration with steroid injections) is associated with the highest likelihood of resolution of nonseptic olecranon bursitis? (2) Which treatment is associated with earliest resolution of symptoms? (3) What factors are associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks?

Methods: We enrolled 133 patients from two centers; after applying prespecified exclusions (septic bursitis or concomitant inflammatory arthritis, intraarticular elbow pathology, recent aspiration or steroid injection done elsewhere, and refusal to participate), 90 patients were randomly allocated to receive compression bandaging with NSAIDs (C), aspiration (A), or aspiration with steroid injection (AS) groups (30 patients in each). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients whose bursitis resolved by Week 4. Secondary outcomes included time to resolution, pain visual analog scale (VAS), and factors associated with treatment failure. The groups were similar at baseline in terms of age and gender. Seven patients (four from Group A and three from Group AS) were lost to followup. All patients were followed up weekly for 4 weeks, and the same treatment procedure was repeated if the bursitis recurred with any substantial fluid collection. At 4 weeks, the state of resolution and pain visual analog scale (VAS) were evaluated. Failed resolution was defined as presence of persistent olecranon bursal fluid collection at Week 4 after the initiation of the treatment; on the contrary, if bursal fluid collection was clinically reduced or completely disappeared by the end of Week 4, the treatment was considered successful. We compared the proportion of resolution by Week 4 and the median times to resolution among the treatment groups. In addition, we evaluated whether the resolution affected pain VAS and what factors were associated with the resolution.

Results: There were no differences in the proportion of patients whose bursitis resolved by Week 4 among the three treatment groups (Group C: 25 of 30 [83%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.27-1.72], p = 0.580; Group A: 17 of 26 [65%], relative risk of resolution failure: 2.19 [95% CI, 0.98-4.87], p = 0.083; Group AS: 23 of 27 [85%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.59 [95% CI, 0.22-1.63], p = 0.398) (p = 0.073).

Longer duration of symptoms before treatment was associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks (failed resolution: 6 weeks [range, 2-9 weeks]; successful resolution: 4 weeks [range, 0.4-6 weeks]; p = 0.008).

Our hypothesis was that there would be no differences in joint line angles or correction accuracy between the two groups, that patellar height would increase after CW HTO and decrease after OW HTO, and that leg length and posterior tibial slope would decrease after CW HTO and increase after OW HTO.

Methods: Radiological data were collected from 70 patients participating in an ongoing prospective randomized clinical trial comparing OW and CW HTOs. Digital standing hip-knee-ankle (HKA) radiographs as well as lateral radiographs in 30Ў of flexion were obtained preoperatively and at 6 months for each patient. Joint line angles, HKA angle, leg length, Insall-Salvati index, Miura-Kawamura index and posterior tibial slope were measured using medical planning software. The complete preoperative radiological examinations of the first 50 patients were used in a study of intra- and inter-rater reliability of the measurements.

Results: The mean posterior slope was reduced by 2.5Ў in CW HTO, whereas it remained unchanged in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Mean leg length decreased 5.7 mm in CW HTO and increased 3.1 mm in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Changes in joint line angles, patellar height indexes and the correction accuracy showed no significant differences comparing the two techniques. Frontal plane reliability measurement intra- and inter-rater intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) varied from 0.81 to 0.99. Sagittal plane intra- and inter-rater ICC varied from 0.60 to 0.87. Posterior tibial slope intra- and inter-rater ICC showed the lowest values (0.70 and 0.60, respectively) corresponding to a smallest real difference of 4.5Ў and 5.5Ў, respectively.

Conclusions: Posterior tibial slope and leg length changes were significantly different in CW compared to OW HTOs.

A Randomized Controlled Trial.,The Journal of Arthroplasty,,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Background:В Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is associated with substantial blood loss in postoperative period. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is potent antifibrinolytic agent, routinely administered by intravenous (IV) and topical route, which can possibly interrupt cascade of events due to hemostatic irregularities close to source of bleeding. However, scientific evidence of combined administration of TXA in TKA is still meagre. The present study aimed to compare efficacy of combined IV and topical TXA with IV use alone in terms of blood loss, transfusion rate, and incidence of deep vein thrombosis and thromboembolism.
Patients and methods:В 119 patients undergoing unilateral TKA were randomized into IV alone and combined group. Patients assigned to IV group were given IV TXA as a preoperative and postoperative dose given 3 and 6 hours after surgery, whereas in combined group, topical TXA solution was applied intraarticularly about 5 minutes before closure of arthrotomy in addition to IV doses.
Results:В Combined use of IV and topical TXA provided better results than IV use alone with mean calculated total blood loss (590.69В±191.1 vs 385.68В±182.5, P<.001), blood transfusion rate (6.6% vs 1.6%, P = .364), hemoglobin drop (1.82В±0.6 vs 1.14В±0.5, P<.001). No case of DVT or TE was noted among the 2 study groups.
Conclusion:В Combined use of IV and intraarticular TXA provided significantly better results compared with IV use alone with respect to all variables related to postoperative blood loss in TKA.

171,26507526,Combined Administration of Systemic and Topical Tranexamic Acid for Total Knee Arthroplasty: Can It Be a Better Regimen and Yet Safe? A Randomized Controlled Trial.,The Journal of Arthroplasty,,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Background: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is associated with substantial blood loss in postoperative period. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is potent antifibrinolytic agent, routinely administered by intravenous (IV) and topical route, which can possibly interrupt cascade of events due to hemostatic irregularities close to source of bleeding. However, scientific evidence of combined administration of TXA in TKA is still meagre. The present study aimed to compare combined IV and topical TXA with IV use alone in patients undergoing TKA.
Patients and methods: 119 patients undergoing unilateral TKA were randomized into IV alone and combined group. The primary outcome was calculated total blood loss. Patients assigned to IV group were given IV TXA as a preoperative and postoperative dose given 3 and 6 hours after surgery, whereas in combined group, topical TXA solution was applied intraarticularly about 5 minutes before closure of arthrotomy in addition to IV doses.
Results: Mean calculated total blood loss was 590.69±191.1 in the IV group vs 385.68±182.5 in the combined group (P<.001). Blood transfusion rate was 6.6% vs 1.6% (P = .364). Hemoglobin drop was 1.82±0.6 vs 1.14±0.5 (P<.001). No case of DVT or TE was noted among the 2 study groups.

Objective: To test the hypothesis that high-intensity endurance training (ET) is superior to moderate-intensity ET for improving risk factors for type 2 diabetes in overweight adolescents.

Design and methods: In this randomized trial, 106 overweight and obese adolescents (15.2 years; 76% female; 62% Caucasian) were randomly assigned to high-intensity ET (70-85% of heart rate reserve, n=38), moderate-intensity ET (40-55% heart rate reserve; n=32) or control for 6 months (n=36). The primary and secondary outcome measures were insulin sensitivity assessed using a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test and hepatic triglyceride content with magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Exploratory outcomes were cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity and MRI and dual x-ray absorptiometry-derived measures of adiposity.

Results: The study had 96% retention and attendance was 61±21% and 55±24% in the high- and moderate-intensity ET arms.

reliable operation in terms of pain relief and return of function. However, 
during the needling process, a cuff defect is created. Little is known about the 
evolution of this defect.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial to 
investigate the evolution of the aforementioned defect and the role of 
platelet-rich plasma (PRP) augmentation in this healing process. Patients were 
randomized to either group 1 (PRP, nвЂ‰=вЂ‰20) or group 2 (no PRP [control group], 
nвЂ‰=вЂ‰20). Patients in group 1 received a perioperative PRP infiltration at the 
rotator cuff defect, whereas the control group did not. Patients were assessed 
clinically preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and 1 
year. The Constant score, Simple Shoulder Test, and QuickDASH (short version of 
Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire) were used as outcome 
measures. The evolution of the cuff defect was evaluated on sonography at 3 and 
6 months and with magnetic resonance imaging after 1 year.
RESULTS: All patients improved significantly after surgery (PвЂ‰<вЂ‰.05). There was 
no difference in clinical outcome or rotator cuff healing between groups. We 
observed a high rate of persistent rotator cuff defects after 1 year in both 
groups. The presence of residual cuff defects did not influence the clinical 
outcome.
CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic needling is an operation with a predictive, good

reliable operation in terms of pain relief and return of function. However, 
during the needling process, a cuff defect is created. Little is known about the 
evolution of this defect.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial to 
investigate the evolution of the aforementioned defect and the role of 
platelet-rich plasma (PRP) augmentation in this healing process. The primary 
outcome was rotator cuff healing. Patients were randomized to either group 1 
(PRP, n = 20) or group 2 (no PRP [control group], n = 20). Patients in group 1 
received a perioperative PRP infiltration at the rotator cuff defect, whereas 
the control group did not. Patients were assessed clinically preoperatively and 
postoperatively at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and 1 year. The Constant score, 
Simple Shoulder Test, and QuickDASH (short version of Disabilities of the Arm, 
Shoulder and Hand questionnaire) were used as secondary outcome measures. The 
evolution of the cuff defect was evaluated on sonography at 3 and 6 months and 
with magnetic resonance imaging after 1 year.
RESULTS: There was no difference in rotator cuff healing between groups. We 
observed a high rate of persistent rotator cuff defects after 1 year in both 
groups. There was no difference in clinical outcome between groups. The presence 
of residual cuff defects did not influence the clinical outcome.

Methods: Participants (n = 53) completed a randomized dietary intervention and consumed either a LF diet (25% fat) or PC diet (33% fat) for 6 weeks. Fat taste thresholds (lowest detectable fat concentration), fat perception (discrimination ability), preference, and anthropometry were assessed at baseline and week 6.

Results: Consumption of a LF diet (n = 26) and PC diet (n = 27) reduced participants' weight (P < 0.001), with no significant differences between groups (LF, -2.9%, PC, -2.7%). Both diets resulted in a decrease in fat taste thresholds (P = 0.014), and the effect tended to be stronger in the LF diet vs. the PC diet (P = 0.060).

This study assessed the effect of a 6-week low-fat (LF) or portion control (PC) diet matched for weight loss on fat taste thresholds, fat perception, and preference in people with overweight/obesity.

Methods: Participants (n = 53) completed a randomized dietary intervention and consumed either a LF diet (25% fat) or PC diet (33% fat) for 6 weeks. Fat taste thresholds (lowest detectable fat concentration), fat perception (discrimination ability), preference, and anthropometry were assessed at baseline and week 6.

Results: Consumption of a LF diet (n = 26) and PC diet (n = 27) reduced participants' weight (P < 0.001), with no significant differences between groups (LF, -2.9%, PC, -2.7%). Both diets resulted in a decrease in fat taste thresholds (P = 0.014), with no significant difference between the LF diet and PC diet (P = 0.060). The ability to perceive different fat concentrations in foods was increased after the LF diet only (P = 0.017); however, food preference did not change on either diet.

It delays mobilization, increases opioid consumption and side effects, and lengthens hospitalization. This challenge multiplies when treating an opioid-dependent population. We examined whether a novel suspended release local anesthetic, liposomal bupivacaine (LB) would improve pain control and decrease opioid consumption after TKA compared to a standard periarticular injection in opioid-dependent patients.

Methods: Thirty-eight patients undergoing TKA were randomly assigned to receive either a periarticular injection (PAI) with LB (n = 20) or with a standard PAI (including a combination of ropivacaine, clonidine, Toradol, Epinepherine, and saline; n = 18) as part of a multimodal pain management approach. All periarticular injections were done by a single surgeon. Perioperative treatment was similar between groups. Postoperative information regarding pain level was evaluated by a pain visual analog scale score. Postoperative opioid consumption was recorded.

Results: After controlling baseline narcotic usage before surgery, no differences were found between groups in daily postoperative narcotic usage (P = .113), average daily pain score (P = .332), or maximum daily pain score (P = .881).

functional scores and ROM were found between the 2 groups at each time point, 
except that group 2 had significantly lower VAS pain scores (P < .05) at 3, 6, 
and 12 months postoperatively. Eight (17%) of 48 patients in group 1 and 6 (18%) 
of 34 patients in group 2 showed retears on MRI at 12-month follow-up (P > .05).

METHODS: One hundred twenty patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff 
repair with SLBC lesions (biceps partial tears <50%, partial pulley lesions, and 
type II SLAP lesions) were enrolled in this prospective comparative study and 
randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups (simple debridement [Deb], biceps 
tenotomy only [BTo], or biceps tenodesis with one suture anchor [BTd]). Patients 
with isolated subscapularis tears or osteoarthritis were excluded. Finally, 86 
patients (Deb in 28, BTo in 27, and BTd in 31) were analyzed (mean follow-up, 
22.1 ± 7.72 months; mean age, 58.98 ± 7.8 years). Pain; functional, clinical,

revisions for treating periprosthetic infection were excluded. Patients were 
statistically compared for demographic parameters, early complications and early

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination of intravenous (IV) and topical tranexamic acid (TXA) in revision THA.

Methods: Eighty-four consecutive patients undergoing revision THA were randomized into combined group and IV-TXA group. Patients in the combined group were given intravenously 15 mg/kg TXA as a preoperative, and topical TXA solution was applied at a concentration of 3 g TXA per 100-mL saline during the different procedure points. Patients in the IV-TXA group were given intravenously 15 mg/kg TXA alone.

Results: The mean total blood loss, drainage volume, and maximum hemoglobin drop were significantly lower in the combined group than the IV-TXA group (P < .001, P < .001, P < .001, respectively). Compared with the IV-TXA group, the amount of blood transfusions and number of blood transfusions required were decreased dramatically in the combined group (P = .027, P < .001, respectively).

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination of intravenous (IV) and topical tranexamic acid (TXA) in revision THA.

Methods: Eighty-four consecutive patients undergoing revision THA were randomized into combined group and IV-TXA group. The primary outcome was total blood loss. Patients in the combined group were given intravenously 15 mg/kg TXA as a preoperative, and topical TXA solution was applied at a concentration of 3 g TXA per 100-mL saline during the different procedure points. Patients in the IV-TXA group were given intravenously 15 mg/kg TXA alone.

Results: The mean total blood loss was 1,247 mL in the combined group and 1,689 mL in the IV-TXA group (P < .001). The drainage volume and maximum hemoglobin drop were lower in the combined group than the IV-TXA group (P < .001, P < .001, respectively).

established as a standard treatment for large full-thickness cartilage defects, 
the effect of different doses of autologous chondrocyte products on structural 
outcomes has never been examined.
HYPOTHESIS: In ACI, the dose level may have an influence on medium-term magnetic 
resonance morphological findings after treatment.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: A total of 75 patients who underwent ACI using a pure, autologous, 
third-generation matrix-associated ACI product were divided into 3 groups 
representing different doses: 3 to 7 spheroids/cm(2), 10 to 30 spheroids/cm(2), 
and 40 to 70 spheroids/cm(2). Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 1.5, 
3, 6, and 12 months after ACI and was evaluated by the magnetic resonance 
observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score and the Knee injury and 
Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS).
RESULTS: MOCART scores showed improvements after 3 months, with slight dose 
dependence, and further improvement after 12 months, although without 
significant dose dependence. The mean MOCART scores after 3 months (0 = worst, 
100 = best) were 59.8, 64.5, and 64.7 for the low-, medium-, and high-dose 
groups, respectively, and 62.9 for all patients; at 12 months, these were 74.1, 
74.5, and 68.8 for the respective dose groups and 72.4 for all patients. Several 
MOCART items (surface of repair tissue, structure of repair tissue, signal 
intensity of repair tissue, subchondral bone, and synovitis) showed a more rapid 
response with the medium and high doses than with the low dose, suggesting a 
potential dose relationship. No significant correlation between the MOCART 
(overall and subscores) with clinical outcomes as assessed by the overall KOOS 
was detected at 3- and 12-month assessments.
CONCLUSION: This study reveals a trend toward earlier recovery after treatment 
with higher spheroid doses in terms of better defect filling for full-thickness 
cartilage defects of the knee, while outcomes after 12 months were similar in 
all dose groups. However, a correlation with clinical outcomes or the failure 
rate at 1 year after ACI was not found. A longer follow-up will be required for 
more definite conclusions on the clinical relevance of ACI cell density to be 
drawn.

patients is under debate.
PURPOSE: To compare clinical outcomes and calf muscle strength recovery after 
the nonsurgical treatment and open surgical repair of acute Achilles tendon 
ruptures with identical accelerated rehabilitation programs.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: From 2009 to 2013, a total of 60 patients with an acute Achilles tendon 
rupture were randomized to surgery or nonsurgical treatment. Nonsurgical 
treatment included first a week of cast immobilization, followed by a functional 
orthosis for 6 weeks, allowing full weightbearing after week 1 and active 
plantar flexion after week 5. Surgery was simple end-to-end open repair, and 
postoperative treatment was identical to nonsurgical treatment. The primary outcome 
was the Leppilahti Achilles tendon performance score. Secondary outcomes included 
isokinetic calf muscle strength and RAND 36-Item Health Survey at 18-month follow-up.
RESULTS: At 18-month follow-up, the mean Leppilahti score was 79.5 and 75.7 for 
the surgically and nonsurgically treated groups, respectively (mean difference, 
3.8; 95% CI, -1.9 to 9.5; P = .19). Angle-specific peak torque results of 
affected legs at 18 months showed a 14% difference in the peak torque of the 
affected leg favoring the surgical group versus the nonsurgical group (mean peak 
torque, 110.3 vs 96.5 N·m, respectively; mean difference, 13.6 N·m; 95% CI, 
2.0-25.1 N·m; P = .022). The RAND 36-Item Health Survey indicated differences 
in the domains of physical functioning (P = .006) and bodily pain (P = .037) 
for surgically treated patients.
CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment was not more effective than nonsurgical treatment

142,27307495,A Prospective Randomized Trial Comparing Surgical and Nonsurgical Treatments of Acute Achilles Tendon Ruptures.,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,,"""Trend toward significance"" // ""Numerically longer survival"" or equivalent verbiage",Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment of acute Achilles tendon ruptures for active 
patients is under debate.
PURPOSE: To compare clinical outcomes and calf muscle strength recovery after 
the nonsurgical treatment and open surgical repair of acute Achilles tendon 
ruptures with identical accelerated rehabilitation programs.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: From 2009 to 2013, a total of 60 patients with an acute Achilles tendon 
rupture were randomized to surgery or nonsurgical treatment. Nonsurgical 
treatment included first a week of cast immobilization, followed by a functional 
orthosis for 6 weeks, allowing full weightbearing after week 1 and active 
plantar flexion after week 5. Surgery was simple end-to-end open repair, and 
postoperative treatment was identical to nonsurgical treatment. Outcome measures 
included the Leppilahti Achilles tendon performance score, isokinetic calf 
muscle strength, and RAND 36-Item Health Survey at 18-month follow-up.
RESULTS: At 18-month follow-up, the mean Leppilahti score was 79.5 and 75.7 for 
the surgically and nonsurgically treated groups, respectively (mean difference, 
3.8; 95% CI, -1.9 to 9.5; P = .19). Angle-specific peak torque results of 
affected legs showed that surgery resulted in faster and better recovery of calf 
muscle strength over the entire range of motion of the ankle joint: at 6 months, 
the difference varied from 16% to 24% (P = .016), favoring the surgically 
treated group, whereas at 18 months, surgically treated patients had 10% to 18% 
greater strength results (P = .037). At 18 months, a 14% difference in the peak 
torque of the affected leg favored the surgical group versus the nonsurgical 
group (mean peak torque, 110.3 vs 96.5 NВ·m, respectively; mean difference, 13.6 
NВ·m; 95% CI, 2.0-25.1 NВ·m; P = .022). The RAND 36-Item Health Survey indicated 
better results in the domains of physical functioning (P = .006) and bodily pain 
(P = .037) for surgically treated patients.
CONCLUSION: Surgical and nonsurgical treatments of acute Achilles tendon 
ruptures have similar results in terms of the Achilles tendon performance score, 
but surgery restores calf muscle strength earlier over the entire range of 
motion of the ankle joint, with a 10% to 18% strength difference favoring 
surgery at 18 months. Surgery may also result in better health-related quality 
of life in the domains of physical functioning and bodily pain compared with 
nonsurgical treatment.

There is still a need for a method of anesthesia that can deliver effective long-term postoperative pain relief without incurring the high cost and health burden of opioids and nerve blocks.

Questions/purposes: (1) Is liposomal bupivacaine-based periarticular injection (PAI) more effective than morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA? (2) Do patients treated with liposomal bupivacaine-based PAI experience fewer opioid-related adverse events compared with patients treated with morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA?

Methods: This multicenter, blind trial randomized 119 patients undergoing TKA with spinal anesthesia to receive spinal anesthesia plus periarticular injection with liposomal bupivacaine (40 patients), spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine plus intrathecal morphine (41 patients) but no liposomal bupivacaine injection, or spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine (38 patients) and no liposomal bupivacaine injection. The two groups that did not receive periarticular liposomal bupivacaine did receive periarticular injection with ropivacaine, and all three groups had ketorolac (30 mg) plus epinephrine (1:1000) in the periarticular injections. Patients in all three groups received identical perioperative multimodal analgesic and antiemetic drugs. All patients were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized and no patients were lost to followup. The primary study endpoints were visual analog score (VAS) for pain and narcotic use during postoperative day 1. Secondary endpoints included side effects associated with narcotic administration during the hospital stay.

Results: Mean VAS pain in the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group was lower than that for the ropivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (1.8 ± 2.1 versus 3.3 ± 2.3, p = 0.005, mean difference: 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-2.5) and 12 hours (1.5 ± 2.0 versus 3.3 ± 2.4, p < 0.001, mean difference: 1.8, 95% CI, 0.8-2.8) after surgery.

The magnitude of the differences at 6 and 12 hours are near the lower end of minimal clinically important differences reported in the literature, and thus the improvement shown in this study may only represent a small clinical improvement.

rare.
PURPOSE: To compare the clinical outcomes of arthroscopic anatomic DB ACLR with 
a hamstring tendon autograft versus irradiated allograft.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: Between 2008 and 2009, a total of 107 patients undergoing arthroscopic 
DB ACLR were prospectively randomized consecutively into 1 of 2 groups 
(autograft [Auto] group and irradiated allograft [Ir-Allo] group). All the 
surgical procedures were performed by the same senior surgeon using the DB 
reconstruction technique. All irradiated hamstring tendon allografts were 
sterilized with 2.5 Mrad of irradiation before distribution and were obtained 
from a single certified tissue bank. Graft fixation on the femoral side was by 
an Endobutton, and on the tibial side by a bioabsorbable interference screw 
augmented with a staple. The same rehabilitation protocol was applied to all 
patients. Before surgery and at a mean of 6.9 years of follow-up, patients were 
evaluated by the same observer according to objective and subjective clinical 
evaluations including detailed history, physical examination, radiography, 
functional knee ligament testing, KT-2000 arthrometer testing, Harner vertical 
jump and Daniel 1-legged hop tests, Lysholm score, Tegner score, International 
Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) standard evaluation form, and Cincinnati

233,27604584,Navigation is Equal to Estimation by Eye and Palpation in Preventing Psoas Impingement in THA.,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,  Focus on (+) subgroup analysis,Claim benefit based on (+) subgroup analysis,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Iliopsoas tendon impingement is one possible reason for persistent 
groin pain and diminished functional outcome after THA. So far, estimation by 
eye and palpation is the standard procedure to intraoperatively assess the 
distance of the cup to the anterior rim. However, novel technologies such as 
imageless navigation enable intraoperative measurements of the cup in relation 
to the psoas tendon and bony landmarks.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether psoas impingement can be reduced using 
imageless navigation compared with the standard technique.
METHODS: The current study is a reanalysis of data from a randomized controlled 
trial evaluating navigation for THA; 135 patients were randomized for surgery 
with or without the use of imageless navigation. The primary outcome was the 
risk for anterior protrusion of the cup above the acetabular rim and thus 
potential psoas impingement, defined as an overhang of the cup above the 
anterior acetabular rim as measured on postoperative CT, which was either 
controlled with the help of navigation or standard control by eye and palpation 
intraoperatively. Postoperatively, the anterior protrusion of the cup above the 
acetabular rim was measured on three-dimensional (3-D) CT by a blinded, external 
institute. In addition to patient-related outcome measures, the Harris hip 
score, Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and EuroQol were 
obtained 1 year postoperatively. Altogether 123 data sets were available for 
primary analysis and 115 were available for 1-year followup.
RESULTS: There was no difference, with the numbers available, between the 
navigated and the control groups in terms of the mean distance of the cup below 
the anterosuperior acetabular rim (3.9 mm; -5.3 to 12.6 mm versus 4.4 mm; -7.9 
to 13.7 mm; p = 0.72) or the anteroinferior acetabular rim (4.7 mm; -6.2 to 14.8 
mm versus 4.2 mm; -7.1 to 16.3 mm; p = 0.29). There was no difference, with the 
numbers available, in terms of the proportion of cups with anterior overhang 
(7%, four of 57 versus, 15%, 10 of 66; p = 0.16), respectively. After 
controlling for potential confounding variables such as cup inclination, cup 
size, patient age, BMI, stage of arthritis, and length of skin incision, we 
found cup anteversion (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% CI, 0.81-0.93; p < 0.001) 
and female sex (HR, 3.88; 95% CI, 1.01-14.93; p = 0.049) were associated with a 
propensity to potential psoas impingement. With the numbers available, there 
were no differences observed in clinical scores between groups with and without 
anterior cup protrusion.

232,27604584,Navigation is Equal to Estimation by Eye and Palpation in Preventing Psoas Impingement in THA.,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,  Focus on (+) subgroup analysis,Claim benefit based on (+) subgroup analysis,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Iliopsoas tendon impingement is one possible reason for persistent 
groin pain and diminished functional outcome after THA. So far, estimation by 
eye and palpation is the standard procedure to intraoperatively assess the 
distance of the cup to the anterior rim. However, novel technologies such as 
imageless navigation enable intraoperative measurements of the cup in relation 
to the psoas tendon and bony landmarks.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether psoas impingement (1) can be reduced using 
imageless navigation compared with the standard technique and (2) is associated 
with specific patient characteristics. Furthermore, we investigated (3) if 
anterior cup protrusion (overhang) is associated with lower outcome scores for 
pain and function.
METHODS: The current study is a reanalysis of data from a randomized controlled 
trial evaluating navigation for THA; 135 patients were randomized for surgery 
with or without the use of imageless navigation. The risk for anterior 
protrusion of the cup above the acetabular rim and thus potential psoas 
impingement, defined as an overhang of the cup above the anterior acetabular rim 
as measured on postoperative CT, was either controlled with the help of 
navigation or standard control by eye and palpation intraoperatively. 
Postoperatively, the anterior protrusion of the cup above the acetabular rim was 
measured on three-dimensional (3-D) CT by a blinded, external institute. In 
addition to patient-related outcome measures, the Harris hip score, Hip 
disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and EuroQol were obtained 1 year 
postoperatively. Altogether 123 data sets were available for primary analysis 
and 115 were available for 1-year followup.
RESULTS: There was no difference, with the numbers available, between the 
navigated and the control groups in terms of the mean distance of the cup below 
the anterosuperior acetabular rim (3.9 mm; -5.3 to 12.6 mm versus 4.4 mm; -7.9 
to 13.7 mm; p = 0.72) or the anteroinferior acetabular rim (4.7 mm; -6.2 to 14.8 
mm versus 4.2 mm; -7.1 to 16.3 mm; p = 0.29). There was no difference, with the 
numbers available, in terms of the proportion of cups with anterior overhang 
(7%, four of 57 versus, 15%, 10 of 66; p = 0.16), respectively. After 
controlling for potential confounding variables such as cup inclination, cup 
size, patient age, BMI, stage of arthritis, and length of skin incision, we 
found cup anteversion (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% CI, 0.81-0.93; p < 0.001) 
and female sex (HR, 3.88; 95% CI, 1.01-14.93; p = 0.049) were associated with a 
propensity to potential psoas impingement. With the numbers available, there 
were no differences observed in clinical scores between groups with and without 
anterior cup protrusion.
CONCLUSIONS: We found no differences between imageless navigation and estimation 
by eye and palpation in preventing potential psoas impingement. Despite the 
comparable clinical outcome for patients with and without cup protrusion, the 
orthopaedic surgeon should be especially aware of propensity for psoas 
impingement in women.",no_spin,5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -0.5998805165290833, 'probability': 0.5488772392272949}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0004040378553327173, 'probability': 0.999596118927002}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.0390231609344482, 'probability': 0.35380008816719055}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.003886647056788206, 'probability': 0.9961208701133728}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.0142607688903809, 'probability': 0.3626704216003418}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0005169962532818317, 'probability': 0.9994831681251526}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -0.8638768196105957, 'probability': 0.4215247333049774}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0007163104019127786, 'probability': 0.9992839097976685}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.3266773223876953, 'probability': 0.26535749435424805}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.001907911617308855, 'probability': 0.9980939030647278}]"

Methods: Forty-two consecutive patients scheduled for hip arthroscopy were randomized into 2 postoperative pain control groups. One group received preemptive intra-articular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection, and the second group received preemptive periacetabular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection. Before closure all patients received an additional dose of 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% intra-articularly. Data were compared with respect to postoperative pain with visual analog scale (VAS) and analgesic consumption, documented in a pain diary for 2 weeks after surgery.

Results: Twenty-one patients were treated with intra-articular injection, and 21 patients with peri-acetabular injection. There were no significant differences with regards to patient demographics or surgical procedures. VAS scores recorded during the first 30 minutes postoperatively and 18 hours after surgery were significantly lower in the periacetabular group compared with in the intra-articular group (0.667 ± 1.49 vs 2.11 ± 2.29; P < .045 and 2.62 ± 2.2 vs 4.79 ± 2.6; P < .009).

Methods: Forty-two consecutive patients scheduled for hip arthroscopy were randomized into 2 postoperative pain control groups. One group received preemptive intra-articular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection, and the second group received preemptive periacetabular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection. Before closure all patients received an additional dose of 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% intra-articularly. Data were compared with respect to postoperative pain with visual analog scale (VAS) and analgesic consumption, documented in a pain diary for 2 weeks after surgery.

Results: Twenty-one patients were treated with intra-articular injection, and 21 patients with peri-acetabular injection. There were no significant differences with regards to patient demographics or surgical procedures. VAS scores recorded during the first 30 minutes postoperatively were 0.667 ± 1.49 in the periacetabular group versus 2.11 ± 2.29 in the intra-articular group (P < .045). VAS scores at 18 hours after surgery were 2.62 ± 2.2 in the periacetabular group versus 4.79 ± 2.6 in the intra-articular group (P < .009).

Design: A randomised controlled trial of 503 participants followed for six months.

Setting: Participants were recruited from two tertiary acute care settings in Kingston, ON, Canada.

Participants: The broad inclusion criteria were patients aged і16 presenting for acute medical assessment and treatment of a simple grade 1 or 2 ankle sprain. Exclusions were patients with multiple injuries, other conditions limiting mobility, and ankle injuries that required immobilisation and those unable to accommodate the time intensive study protocol.

Intervention: Participants received either usual care, consisting of written instructions regarding protection, rest, cryotherapy, compression, elevation, and graduated weight bearing activities, or usual care enhanced with a supervised programme of physiotherapy.

Main outcome measures: The primary outcome of efficacy was the proportion of participants reporting excellent recovery assessed with the foot and ankle outcome score (FAOS). Excellent recovery was defined as a score і450/500 at three months. A difference of at least 15% increase in the absolute proportion of participants with excellent recovery was deemed clinically important.

The primary outcome measure was the change in pain scores at 15 minutes; secondary outcomes were changes in pain intensity after pain onset and need for rescue medication.

Results: Patients (n=162) were randomized into 2 groups with similar baseline migraine characteristics and numeric rating scale scores. The median reduction in numeric rating scale score at 15 minutes was 3 (interquartile range [IQR] 2 to 5) for the lidocaine group and 2 (IQR 1 to 4) for the saline solution group (median difference=1.0; 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 2.1). The reduction in pain score at 30 minutes was 4 (IQR 3 to 7) for the lidocaine group and 5 (IQR 2 to 7) for the saline solution group (median difference=1.0; 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 2.1). Need for rescue medication did not differ between the groups, and local irritation was the most common adverse event in the lidocaine group.

Methods: A total of 181 overweight and obese adolescents aged 13-15 years old were randomized in the three study groups (""Diet & Activity,"" ""Activity,"" and Control). The Activity intervention included a 45-minute, 3-day per week supervised training program, while the Diet & Activity intervention included a supplementary 15 minutes of group-based sessions attended by the parents. The intervention lasted 3 months and the participants were followed for another 3 months after the intervention. The participants were assessed for anthropometric measures and activity and fulfilled the modified version of the questionnaire ""Family Eating and Activity Habits Questionnaire"" (FEAHQ).

Methods: A total of 181 overweight and obese adolescents aged 13-15 years old were randomized in the three study groups (""Diet & Activity,"" ""Activity,"" and Control). The Activity intervention included a 45-minute, 3-day per week supervised training program, while the Diet & Activity intervention included a supplementary 15 minutes of group-based sessions attended by the parents. The intervention lasted 3 months and the participants were followed for another 3 months after the intervention. The primary outcome was body mass index (BMI). The participants were assessed for anthropometric measures and activity and fulfilled the modified version of the questionnaire ""Family Eating and Activity Habits Questionnaire"" (FEAHQ).

Results: Both ""Activity"" only and ""Diet & Activity"" groups reduced their mean body mass index (BMI) (-1.1, 95% CI -1.3, -0.8, and -1.4, 95% CI -1.7, -1.2, respectively) compared to control at 3 months, with greater reductions at 6 months (-2.3, 95% CI -2.6, -2.0, and -3.1, 95% CI -3.3, -2.8).

141,28146397,A Prospective Randomized Study Comparing the Interference Screw and Suture Anchor Techniques for Biceps Tenodesis.,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Several methods are used to perform biceps tenodesis in patients 
with superior labrum-biceps complex (SLBC) lesions accompanied by a rotator cuff 
tear. However, limited clinical data are available regarding the best technique 
in terms of clinical and anatomic outcomes.
PURPOSE: To compare the clinical and anatomic outcomes of the interference screw 
(IS) and suture anchor (SA) fixation techniques for biceps tenodesis performed 
along with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: A total of 80 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair 
with SLBC lesions were prospectively enrolled and randomly divided according to 
the tenodesis method: the IS and SA groups. The primary outcome was the anatomic 
status of tenodesis estimated using magnetic resonance imaging or 
ultrasonography. Anatomic failure of tenodesis was determined when the biceps 
tendon was not traced in the intertubercular groove directly from the insertion 
site of the IS or SA. Secondary outcomes included functional outcomes evaluated 
with the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, American Shoulder and Elbow 
Surgeons (ASES) score, Simple Shoulder Test (SST), Constant score, Korean 
Shoulder Score (KSS), and long head of the biceps (LHB) score at least 2 years 
after surgery.
RESULTS: Thirty-three patients in the IS group and 34 in the SA group were 
monitored for more than 2 years. Nine anatomic failures of tenodesis were 
observed: 7 in the IS group and 2 in the SA group (P = .083). All postoperative 
functional scores improved compared with the preoperative scores and were not 
significantly different between the groups, including the LHB score (all P > 
.05). In a multivariate analysis using logistic regression, IS fixation (P = 
.003) and a higher work level (P = .022) were factors associated with the 
anatomic failure of tenodesis. In patients with tenodesis failure, the LHB score 
(P = .049) and the degree of Popeye deformity by the patient and examiner (P = 
.004 and .018, respectively) were statistically different compared with patients 
with intact tenodeses.

140,28146397,A Prospective Randomized Study Comparing the Interference Screw and Suture Anchor Techniques for Biceps Tenodesis.,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Several methods are used to perform biceps tenodesis in patients 
with superior labrum-biceps complex (SLBC) lesions accompanied by a rotator cuff 
tear. However, limited clinical data are available regarding the best technique 
in terms of clinical and anatomic outcomes.
PURPOSE: To compare the clinical and anatomic outcomes of the interference screw 
(IS) and suture anchor (SA) fixation techniques for biceps tenodesis performed 
along with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: A total of 80 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair 
with SLBC lesions were prospectively enrolled and randomly divided according to 
the tenodesis method: the IS and SA groups. Functional outcomes were evaluated 
with the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, American Shoulder and Elbow 
Surgeons (ASES) score, Simple Shoulder Test (SST), Constant score, Korean 
Shoulder Score (KSS), and long head of the biceps (LHB) score at least 2 years 
after surgery. The anatomic status of tenodesis was estimated using magnetic 
resonance imaging or ultrasonography, and the anatomic failure of tenodesis was 
determined when the biceps tendon was not traced in the intertubercular groove 
directly from the insertion site of the IS or SA.
RESULTS: Thirty-three patients in the IS group and 34 in the SA group were 
monitored for more than 2 years. All postoperative functional scores improved 
significantly compared with the preoperative scores (all P < .001) and were not 
significantly different between the groups, including the LHB score (all P > 
.05). Nine anatomic failures of tenodesis were observed: 7 in the IS group and 2 
in the SA group ( P = .083). In a multivariate analysis using logistic 
regression, IS fixation ( P = .003) and a higher (ie, more physically demanding) 
work level ( P = .022) were factors associated with the anatomic failure of 
tenodesis significantly. In patients with tenodesis failure, the LHB score ( P = 
.049) and the degree of Popeye deformity by the patient and examiner ( P = .004 
and .018, respectively) were statistically different compared with patients with 
intact tenodeses.
CONCLUSION: Care must be taken while performing biceps tenodesis in patients 
with a higher work level; IS fixation appears to pose a higher risk in terms of 
the anatomic failure of tenodesis than SA fixation, although functional outcomes 
were not different.",no_spin,5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -0.7870911955833435, 'probability': 0.45516687631607056}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0008534126682206988, 'probability': 0.9991469979286194}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.9196248054504395, 'probability': 0.3986686170101166}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0008641323074698448, 'probability': 0.999136209487915}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.0711060762405396, 'probability': 0.3426293432712555}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.000979420612566173, 'probability': 0.999021053314209}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.1249890327453613, 'probability': 0.32465603947639465}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0015397133538499475, 'probability': 0.9984615445137024}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.2344871759414673, 'probability': 0.2909839451313019}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0023185533937066793, 'probability': 0.997684121131897}]"
134,28146402,A Multicenter Study of Early Anti-inflammatory Treatment in Patients With Acute Anterior Cruciate Ligament Tear.,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,,Claim benefit based on (+) secondary endpoint,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: It is increasingly recognized that biochemical abnormalities of the 
joint precede radiographic abnormalities of posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) 
by as much as decades. A growing body of evidence strongly suggests that the 
progression from anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury to PTOA is 
multifactorial, involving the interplay between biomechanical disturbances and 
biochemical homeostasis of articular cartilage.
PURPOSE: The purposes of this randomized study using an acute ACL injury model 
were to (1) evaluate the natural progression of inflammatory and 
chondrodegenerative biomarkers, (2) evaluate the relationship between subjective 
reports of pain and inflammatory and chondrodegenerative biomarkers, and (3) 
determine if postinjury arthrocentesis and corticosteroid injection offer the 
ability to alter this biochemical cascade.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: A total of 49 patients were randomized to 4 groups: group 1 
(corticosteroid at 4 days after ACL injury, placebo injection of saline at 2 
weeks), group 2 (placebo at 4 days after ACL injury, corticosteroid at 2 weeks), 
group 3 (corticosteroid at both time intervals), or a placebo group (saline 
injections at both time intervals). Patient-reported outcome measures and 
synovial biomarkers were collected at approximately 4 days, 11 days, and 5 weeks 
after injury. The change between the time points was assessed for all variables 
using Wilcoxon tests, and the relationship between changes in outcome scores and 
biomarkers were assessed by calculating Spearman ПЃ. Outcomes and biomarkers were 
also compared between the 4 groups using Kruskal-Wallis tests.
RESULTS: No adverse events or infections were observed in any study patients. 
With the exception of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) and tumor necrosis 
factor-inducible gene 6 (TSG-6), chondrodegenerative markers worsened over the 
first 5 weeks while all patient-reported outcomes improved during this time, 
regardless of treatment group. Patient-reported outcomes did not differ between 
patients receiving corticosteroid injections and the placebo group. However, 
increases in C-telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II), associated with 
collagen type II breakdown, were significantly greater in the placebo group 
(1.32 В± 1.10 ng/mL) than in either of the groups that received the 
corticosteroid injection within the first several days after injury (group 1: 
0.23 В± 0.27 ng/mL [ P = .01]; group 3: 0.19 В± 0.34 ng/mL [ P = .01]).
CONCLUSION: PTOA begins at the time of injury and results early on in dramatic 
matrix changes in the knee. However, it is encouraging that early intervention 
with an anti-inflammatory agent was able to affect biomarkers of chondral 
degeneration. Should early intervention lead to meaningful changes in either the 
onset or severity of symptomatic PTOA, the current treatment paradigm for 
patients with ACL injury may have to be restructured to include early aspiration 
and intra-articular intervention.",no_spin,5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.0810610055923462, 'probability': 0.33923542499542236}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0011479223612695932, 'probability': 0.9988527297973633}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.9371861815452576, 'probability': 0.3917285203933716}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0011988840997219086, 'probability': 0.9988018870353699}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.1857126951217651, 'probability': 0.3055283725261688}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.003340618684887886, 'probability': 0.9966649413108826}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.5899173021316528, 'probability': 0.2039424628019333}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0022770448122173548, 'probability': 0.9977255463600159}]",10,10,"[{'token': 605, 'token_string': '10', 'logits': -1.1306344270706177, 'probability': 0.32282838225364685}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0005708495154976845, 'probability': 0.9994292855262756}]"

warm humidified oxygen (HFWHO) is increasingly used, but has not been rigorously

enhanced respiratory support, thereby shortening time to weaning off oxygen.
METHODS: In this open, phase 4, randomised controlled trial, we recruited 
children aged less than 24 months with moderate bronchiolitis attending the 
emergency department of the John Hunter Hospital or the medical unit of the John 
Hunter Children's Hospital in New South Wales, Australia. Patients were randomly 
allocated (1:1) via opaque sealed envelopes to HFWHO (maximum flow of 1 L/kg per 
min to a limit of 20 L/min using 1:1 air-oxygen ratio, resulting in a maximum 
FiO2 of 0В·6) or standard therapy (cold wall oxygen 100% via infant nasal 
cannulae at low flow to a maximum of 2 L/min) using a block size of four and 
stratifying for gestational age at birth. The primary outcome was time from 
randomisation to last use of oxygen therapy. All randomised children were 
included in the primary and secondary safety analyses. This trial is registered

FINDINGS: From July 16, 2012, to May 1, 2015, we randomly assigned 202 children 
to either HFWHO (101 children) or standard therapy (101 children). Median time 
to weaning was 24 h (95% CI 18-28) for standard therapy and 20 h (95% CI 17-34) 
for HFWHO (hazard ratio [HR] for difference in survival distributions 0В·9 [95% 
CI 0В·7-1В·2]; log rank p=0В·61). Fewer children experienced treatment failure on 
HFWHO (14 [14%]) compared with standard therapy (33 [33%]; p=0В·0016); of these 
children, those on HFWHO were supported for longer than were those on standard 
therapy before treatment failure (HR 0В·3; 95% CI 0В·2-0В·6; p<0В·0001). 20 (61%) of 
33 children who experienced treatment failure on standard therapy were rescued 
with HFWHO. 12 (12%) of children on standard therapy required transfer to the 
intensive care unit compared with 14 (14%) of those on HFWHO (difference -1%; 
95% CI -7 to 16; p=0В·41). Four adverse events occurred (oxygen desaturation and 
condensation inhalation in the HFWHO group, and two incidences of oxygen tubing 
disconnection in the standard therapy group); none resulted in withdrawal from 
the trial. No oxygen-related serious adverse events occurred. Secondary 
effectiveness outcomes are reported in the Results section.
INTERPRETATION: HFWHO did not significantly reduce time on oxygen compared with 
standard therapy, suggesting that early use of HFWHO does not modify the 
underlying disease process in moderately severe bronchiolitis. HFWHO might have

techniques for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Controversy has arisen as each 
conceptually differs in how the knee is balanced through bone and soft tissue 
management. The objective of the present study was to compare both the frequency 
of condylar liftoff and the location of femorotibial contact from extension 
through midflexion between patients undergoing GB or MR TKA.
METHODS: A total of 24 knees (23 patients) were randomly assigned at referral to 
either a surgeon performing MR or GB TKA with the same single radius, 
posterior-stabilized implant (12 per cohort). At 1-year postoperation, patients 
underwent biplanar radiographic imaging at 0В°, 20В°, 40В°, and 60В° of flexion. 
Condylar liftoff, contact location, and magnitude of excursion on each condyle 
were measured. Preoperative and postoperative clinical outcome scores were also 
collected.
RESULTS: There was no difference (PВ = .41) in the frequency of liftoff between 
cohorts. The MR cohort had more posterior contact on the medial condyle (P < 
.01) and more anterior contact on the lateral condyle (P < .01) throughout 
flexion. Motion patterns were similar between cohorts, with similar medial (PВ =

during a pediatric emergency department (ED) asthma visit increases ongoing use 
and improves outcomes.
METHODS: This randomized trial enrolled children aged 1 to 18 years, with 
persistent asthma not previously prescribed a controller medication, and who 
were being discharged after ED asthma treatment. Intervention subjects received 
a 1-month prescription for an inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone or budesonide 
by age) in addition to standard asthma therapy and instructions given to all 
patients. The primary outcome was filling of subsequent inhaled corticosteroid 
prescriptions. Secondary outcomes included filling of the intervention prescription, 
asthma-related symptoms and quality of life, and follow-up rates with a primary 
care provider. Outcomes were assessed during telephone interviews 2 and 8 weeks

during a pediatric emergency department (ED) asthma visit increases ongoing use 
and improves outcomes.
METHODS: This randomized trial enrolled children aged 1 to 18 years, with 
persistent asthma not previously prescribed a controller medication, and who 
were being discharged after ED asthma treatment. Intervention subjects received 
a 1-month prescription for an inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone or budesonide 
by age) in addition to standard asthma therapy and instructions given to all 
patients. Outcomes included filling of the intervention and subsequent inhaled 
corticosteroid prescriptions, asthma-related symptoms and quality of life, and 
follow-up rates with a primary care provider. Outcomes were assessed during 
telephone interviews 2 and 8 weeks after the ED visit and by review of primary 
care provider and pharmacy records.
RESULTS: One hundred forty-seven children were enrolled, and baseline measures 
were similar between groups. In the intervention group, 53.5% of patients filled 
an initial ED prescription for inhaled corticosteroid. There was no important 
difference between groups in subsequent filling of a primary care provider 
prescription (21% intervention versus 17% control; relative rate=1.24; 95% 
confidence interval 0.63 to 2.41). During the 2 weeks after the ED visit, 
intervention subjects reported reduced shortness of breath while awake and cough 
while asleep compared with controls. Groups did not differ by rates of primary 
care provider follow-up, functional limitations, or asthma-related symptoms and

created: V-group (VicrylВ® 2/0-Ethicon) and S-group (Stratafixв„ў 2/0-Ethicon). 
Time spent on closing the enterotomies was measured from first needle in until

HYPOTHESIS: The quality of cartilage repair and clinical outcomes would be 
superior in patients undergoing high tibial osteotomy (HTO) with microfracture 
and collagen augmentation compared to those undergoing HTO with microfracture 
alone without collagen augmentation for the treatment of medial compartment 
osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.
METHODS: Twenty-eight patients undergoing HTO were randomized into 2 groups: 
microfracture alone (group 1, n = 14) or microfracture with collagen 
augmentation (group 2, n = 14). At 1 year postoperatively, second-look 
arthroscopic surgery and biopsy of repaired cartilage were performed at the time 
of HTO plate removal. Biopsy specimens were graded using the International 
Cartilage Repair Society Visual Assessment Scale II (ICRS II). In addition, 
imaging outcomes in terms of the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage 
repair tissue (MOCART) score were assessed based on magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI). Finally, clinical outcomes in terms of the visual analog scale (VAS) for 
pain score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International

evaluated.
RESULTS: The mean ICRS II score in group 2 was significantly higher than that in 
group 1 (1053.2 vs 885.4, respectively; P = .002). Group 2 showed greater 
improvement in tissue morphology, cell morphology, surface architecture, 
middle/deep zone assessment, and overall assessment compared with group 1 ( P <

superior in group 2 compared to those in group 1 on MRI at 1 year

score were improved in both groups without between-group differences ( P > .100

CONCLUSION: The quality of cartilage repair after microfracture with collagen

increasing focus on clinical outcomes, patient satisfaction, and cost has 
created a need for better acute postoperative pain control for patients. An 
ideal pain control method would have few side effects, decreased opioid 
consumption, improved pain control, early ambulation, and decreased hospital 
length of stay (LOS).
METHODS: We performed a prospective randomized, controlled study involving 79 
patients undergoing elective THA between June 2015 and February 2016. Forty 
patients received liposomal bupivacaine and 39 patients received a fascia iliaca 
compartment block (FICB). In addition, the medical records of 28 patients who 
underwent elective THA between May 2015 and December 2015 were retrospectively 
examined. The primary outcome was visual analog scale pain scores and the 
secondary outcomes were LOS and total opioid consumption. SPSS, version 22, was 
used to run 1-way analysis of variance with contrast and Mood's median test on 
the data.
RESULTS: There were statistically significant decreases in pain intensity (PВ = 
.019) and LOS (PВ = .041) in both the liposomal bupivacaine group and the FICB 
group compared with those in the retrospective control group. In addition, only 
the FICB group showed statistically significant decreased total opioid 
consumption compared with that in the retrospective group (PВ = .028).
CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing elective THA have decreased overall pain

increasing focus on clinical outcomes, patient satisfaction, and cost has 
created a need for better acute postoperative pain control for patients. An 
ideal pain control method would have few side effects, decreased opioid 
consumption, improved pain control, early ambulation, and decreased hospital 
length of stay (LOS).
METHODS: We performed a prospective randomized, controlled study involving 79 
patients undergoing elective THA between June 2015 and February 2016. Forty 
patients received liposomal bupivacaine and 39 patients received a fascia iliaca 
compartment block (FICB). In addition, the medical records of 28 patients who 
underwent elective THA between May 2015 and December 2015 were retrospectively 
examined. The primary outcome was visual analog scale pain scores and the 
secondary outcomes were LOS and total opioid consumption. SPSS, version 22, was 
used to run 1-way analysis of variance with contrast and Mood's median test on 
the data.
RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in pain intensity 
between the liposomal bupivacaine group and the FICB group (P > .05). LOS was 
similar between the two treatment groups (P > .05). Total opioid consumption 
was not significantly different between the liposomal bupivacaine and FICB 
groups (P > .05). Both treatment groups showed statistically significant 
differences compared with the retrospective control group for pain intensity (P 
= .019) and LOS (P = .041). Only the FICB group showed statistically 
significant decreased total opioid consumption compared with the retrospective 
group (P = .028).

analog scale pain scores in patients undergoing elective THA.",spin,5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -0.8992102146148682, 'probability': 0.4068908989429474}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.00031537804170511663, 'probability': 0.9996845722198486}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -0.7484884262084961, 'probability': 0.473081111907959}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0007522851810790598, 'probability': 0.9992479681968689}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -0.630722165107727, 'probability': 0.5322073101997375}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.00029988560709170997, 'probability': 0.999700129032135}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -0.778662919998169, 'probability': 0.45901939272880554}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.00047755756531842053, 'probability': 0.9995225071907043}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -0.7857126593589783, 'probability': 0.4557947814464569}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0005106813623569906, 'probability': 0.999489426612854}]"

Biological analysis of PRP has demonstrated an anti-inflammatory effect on the intra-articular environment.

Purpose: To compare the clinical and biological effects of an intra-articular injection of PRP with those of an intra-articular injection of HA in patients with mild to moderate knee OA.

Study design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods: A total of 111 patients with symptomatic unilateral knee OA received a series of either leukocyte-poor PRP or HA injections under ultrasound guidance. Clinical data were collected before treatment and at 4 time points across a 1-year period. Synovial fluid was also collected for analysis of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers before treatment and at 12 and 24 weeks after treatment. Several measures were used to assess results: (1) Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale; (2) International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee evaluation, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, and Lysholm knee score; and (3) difference in intra-articular biochemical marker concentrations.

Results: There were 49 patients randomized to treatment with PRP and 50 randomized to treatment with HA. No difference was seen between the groups in the primary outcome measure (WOMAC pain score). In the secondary outcome measure, linear contrasts identified a significantly higher IKDC score in the PRP group compared with the HA group at 24 weeks (mean ± standard error [SE], 65.5 ± 3.6 vs 55.8 ± 3.8, respectively; P = .013) and at final follow-up (52 weeks) (57.6 ± 3.37 vs 46.6 ± 3.76, respectively; P = .003). Linear contrasts also identified a statistically lower VAS score in the PRP group versus the HA group at 24 weeks (mean ± SE, 34.6 ± 3.24 vs 48.6 ± 3.7, respectively; P = .0096) and 52 weeks (44 ± 4.6 vs 57.3 ± 3.8, respectively; P = .0039). An examination of fixed effects showed that patients with mild OA and a lower body mass index had a statistically significant improvement in outcomes. In the biochemical analysis, differences between groups approached significance for interleukin-1_ (mean ± SE, 0.14 ± 0.05 pg/mL [PRP] vs 0.34 ± 0.16 pg/mL [HA]; P = .06) and tumor necrosis factor _ (0.08 ± 0.01 pg/mL [PRP] vs 0.2 ± 0.18 pg/mL [HA]; P = .068) at 12-week follow-up.

Conclusion: We found no difference between HA and PRP at any time point in the primary outcome measure: the patient-reported WOMAC pain score. Significant improvements were seen in other patient-reported outcome measures, with results favoring PRP over HA.

Methods: Black and Hispanic adults (N = 405) with body mass index 25-50 kg/m2 selected one of ten small change eating strategies and a physical activity goal, randomly with/without PA/SA. Participants were followed by community health workers at set intervals (weekly in months 1-3; biweekly in months 4-9; once monthly in months 10-12).

Results: There was no difference in weight loss at 12 months between participants in the small change approach alone (1.1%) versus the small change PA/SA intervention (1.2%). During treatment, 9% of participants lost at least 7% of their initial body weight. Participants who reported more interval life events had a lower likelihood of losing weight (P < 0.0001).

efficacy of autologous platelet-richВ plasma (PRP) injections and arthroscopic

METHODS: Patients who had a clinical diagnosis of LE confirmed by ultrasound 
(US) were included in this study. A total of 101 patients received arthroscopic 
release (nВ = 50) or US-guided PRP injections (nВ = 51). Outcomes were assessed 
using a visual analog scale for pain, the Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation

RESULTS: Both patient groups experienced significant improvement in all 
measures. Between-group comparisons showed a significantly higher value in the

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) seems to achieve equal weight loss as laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), but there is still much debate about the quality of life (QOL) after LSG, mainly concerning the association with gastroesophageal reflux. Our hypothesis is that QOL after LSG is comparable with QOL after LRYGB.

Materials and methods: Between February 2013 and February 2014, 150 patients were randomized to undergo either LSG or LRYGB in our clinic. Differences in QOL were compared between groups by using multiple QOL questionnaires at follow-up moments preoperatively and 2 and 12 months after surgery.

Results: After 12 months of follow-up, 128 patients had returned the questionnaires. Most QOL questionnaires showed significant improvement in scores between the preoperative moment and after 12 months of follow-up. The Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Questionnaire (GerdQ) score deteriorated in the LSG group after 2 months, but recovered again after 12 months.

RESULTS: Visual analog scale pain scores were statistically higher in the LB 
cohort immediately postoperatively in the postanesthesia care unit (7.25 vs. 
1.91; PвЂ‰=вЂ‰.000) as well as for the remainder of postoperative day 0 (4.99 vs.

significantly higher among the LB cohort in the postanesthesia care unit (31.79 
vs. 7.47; PвЂ‰=вЂ‰.000), on postoperative day 0 (32.64 vs. 15.04; PвЂ‰=вЂ‰.000), and for 
the total hospital admission (189.50 vs. 91.70, PвЂ‰=вЂ‰.000). Complication numbers

Methods: Sixty morbid obese patients (BMI і 35) were evaluated before and after 12 weeks of bariatric surgery in order to compare the impact of two different exercise programs on body composition and functional capacity outcomes. Participants were divided into three groups: aerobic (A), aerobic-strength (AS), and control (C) group. Aerobic capacity was assessed with 12-min walk-run test (12MWRT). One-repetition maximum (1RM) test was performed to evaluation upper limb muscle strength. Lower extremity functional capacity was assessed by sit-to-stand test.

Results: Weight, percent body fat (PBF), and fat mass (FM) reduced greater in the trial groups in comparison to the C group (P < 0.05).

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole

alone.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized 
superiority trial in 5 US emergency departments among outpatients older than 12 
years with cellulitis and no wound, purulent drainage, or abscess enrolled from 
April 2009 through June 2012. All participants had soft tissue ultrasound 
performed at the time of enrollment to exclude abscess. Final follow-up was 
August 2012.
INTERVENTIONS: Cephalexin, 500 mg 4 times daily, plus 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily, for 7 days (nвЂ‰=вЂ‰248 
participants) or cephalexin plus placebo for 7 days (nвЂ‰=вЂ‰248 participants).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome determined a priori in the 
per-protocol group was clinical cure, defined as absence of these clinical 
failure criteria at follow-up visits: fever; increase in erythema (>25%), 
swelling, or tenderness (days 3-4); no decrease in erythema, swelling, or 
tenderness (days 8-10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness 
(days 14-21). A clinically significant difference was defined as greater than 
10%.
RESULTS: Among 500 randomized participants, 496 (99%) were included in the 
modified intention-to-treat analysis and 411 (82.2%) in the per-protocol 
analysis (median age, 40 years [range, 15-78 years]; 58.4% male; 10.9% had 
diabetes). Median length and width of erythema were 13.0 cm and 10.0 cm. In the 
per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 182 (83.5%) of 218

care-centered program (Next Steps) in low-income children.
METHODS: Five hundred forty-nine Hispanic and black children (BMIвЂ‰в‰ҐвЂ‰85th

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: A total of 60 patients (30 control; 30 PRP) were initially randomized 
to receive 2 ultrasound-guided injections of PRP to the tendon repair site at 7 
and 14 days after double-row arthroscopic supraspinatus repair or not. A total 
of 55 patients (91.7%) underwent a clinical review and magnetic resonance

246,33332160,Platelet-rich plasma for arthroscopic repair of medium to large rotator cuff tears: a randomized controlled trial.,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,,Claim benefit based on (+) secondary endpoint,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether leukocyte-poor (LP) or leukocyte-rich (LR) 
varieties of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) as an adjuvant to arthroscopic rotator 
cuff repair (ARCR) result in improved tendon healing rates.
PURPOSE: To perform a network meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials 
in the literature to ascertain whether there is evidence to support the use of 
LP- or LR-PRP as an adjunct to ARCR.
METHODS: The literature search was based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Randomized 
controlled trials comparing LP- or LR-PRP with a control alongside ARCR were 
included. Clinical outcomes, including retears and functional outcomes, were 
compared using a frequentist approach to network meta-analysis, with statistical 
analysis performed using R. The treatment options were ranked using the P-score.
RESULTS: There were 13 studies (868 patients) included, with 9 studies comparing 
LP-PRP with a control and 4 studies comparing LR-PRP with a control. LP-PRP was 
found to significantly reduce the rate of retear and/or incomplete tendon 
healing after fixation, even among medium-large tears; it also improved outcomes 
on the visual analog scale for pain, Constant score, and University of 
California Los Angeles score. LP-PRP had the highest P-score for all treatment 
groups. LR-PRP did not result in any significant improvements over the control 
group, except for visual analog scale score for pain. However, post hoc analysis 
revealed that LP-PRP did not lead to significant improvements over LR-PRP in any 
category.
CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrates that LP-PRP reduces the rate of

247,33332160,Platelet-rich plasma for arthroscopic repair of medium to large rotator cuff tears: a randomized controlled trial.,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,,Claim benefit based on (+) secondary endpoint,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether leukocyte-poor (LP) or leukocyte-rich (LR) 
varieties of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) as an adjuvant to arthroscopic rotator 
cuff repair (ARCR) result in improved tendon healing rates.
PURPOSE: To perform a network meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials 
in the literature to ascertain whether there is evidence to support the use of 
LP- or LR-PRP as an adjunct to ARCR.
METHODS: The literature search was based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Randomized 
controlled trials comparing LP- or LR-PRP with a control alongside ARCR were 
included. Clinical outcomes, including retears and functional outcomes, were 
compared using a frequentist approach to network meta-analysis, with statistical 
analysis performed using R. The treatment options were ranked using the P-score.
RESULTS: There were 13 studies (868 patients) included, with 9 studies comparing 
LP-PRP with a control and 4 studies comparing LR-PRP with a control. LP-PRP was 
found to reduce the rate of retear and/or incomplete tendon healing after 
fixation; it also improved outcomes on the visual analog scale for pain, 
Constant score, and University of California Los Angeles score. LP-PRP had the 
highest P-score for all treatment groups. LR-PRP did not result in any 
significant improvements over the control group, except for visual analog scale 
score for pain. Post hoc analysis revealed that LP-PRP did not lead to 
significant improvements over LR-PRP in any category.
CONCLUSION: LP-PRP was not more effective than LR-PRP in patients undergoing 
arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.",spin,5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -0.8753806352615356, 'probability': 0.41670337319374084}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0008654424455016851, 'probability': 0.99913489818573}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.7492398023605347, 'probability': 0.4727257490158081}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0007121411035768688, 'probability': 0.9992881417274475}]",10,10,"[{'token': 605, 'token_string': '10', 'logits': -1.3168482780456543, 'probability': 0.2679785490036011}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0002079985715681687, 'probability': 0.9997920989990234}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.4872515201568604, 'probability': 0.22599294781684875}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.0003592322755139321, 'probability': 0.9996408820152283}]",10,10,"[{'token': 605, 'token_string': '10', 'logits': -1.4060317277908325, 'probability': 0.2451140433549881}, {'token': 100257, 'token_string': '<|endoftext|>', 'logits': -0.00041368984966538846, 'probability': 0.9995863437652588}]"
