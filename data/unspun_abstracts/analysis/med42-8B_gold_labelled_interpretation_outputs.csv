254,18237696,Prospective randomized comparison of anatomic single- and double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy",  Focus on (+) secondary endpoint,,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Purpose
To determine if anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is superior to anatomic single-bundle reconstruction in restoring the stabilities and functions of the knee joint.
Methods
A prospective randomized clinical study was done to compare the results of 32 cases of anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction and 34 cases of anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction with average follow-up of 16.3 В± 3.1В months. Tunnel placements of all the cases were measured on 3D CT. Clinical results were collected after reconstruction; graft's appearance, meniscus status and cartilage state under arthroscopy were compared and analysed too.
Results
Tunnel placements, confirmed with 3D CT, were in the anatomic positions as described in literature both in SB and DB group. No differences were found between SB and DB groups in clinical outcome scores, pivot shift test and KT 1000В measurements (average side-to-side difference for anterior tibial translation was 0.7В mm in SB group and 1.0В mm in DB group). More than 70 % of the single-bundle graft and AM bundle graft in DB group appeared excellent, but only 44.1 % of PL bundle grafts in DB group were excellent and 11.8 % were in poor state. No new menisci tear was found either in SB or DB group, however, in DB group cartilage damages in medial patella-femoral joint occurred in 38.2 % cases. This rate was significantly higher than in the SB group which is only 9.3 %.
Conclusion
Both single- and double-bundle anatomic ACL reconstruction can restore the knee's stability and functions very well. However, more incidences of poor PL status and medial patellar-femoral cartilage damage may occur in double-bundle ACL reconstruction.",no_spin,7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -0.23886330425739288, 'probability': 0.7875224947929382}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.005041861440986395, 'probability': 0.9949708580970764}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.6702764630317688, 'probability': 0.5115671157836914}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.008319247514009476, 'probability': 0.9917153120040894}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.547798752784729, 'probability': 0.5782212018966675}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.004339801147580147, 'probability': 0.9956695437431335}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.1263799667358398, 'probability': 0.32420477271080017}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.008121679536998272, 'probability': 0.9919112324714661}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -1.0631399154663086, 'probability': 0.3453696668148041}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.005118124652653933, 'probability': 0.9948949217796326}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]"

dextrose in normal saline solution compared with normal saline solution will 
lead to a lower proportion of hospitalized patients and a greater reduction in 
serum ketone levels in children with gastroenteritis and dehydration.
METHODS: We enrolled children aged 6 months to 6 years in a double-blind, 
randomized controlled trial of patients presenting to a pediatric emergency 
department. Subjects were randomized to receive a 20 mL/kg infusion of either 5% 
dextrose in normal saline solution or normal saline solution. Serum ketone 
levels were measured before and at 1- and 2-hour intervals after the initial

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of the two procedures in patients older than 55 years of age affected by reparable rotator cuff tears with concomitant long head biceps pathologies.

Methods: Patients older than 55 years of age with long head biceps lesions and reparable rotator cuff tears were selected for this study. A total of 151 patients were randomly assigned to the tenotomy group (77 patients) or the tenodesis group (74 patients). Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was performed in all the patients. Before surgery, physical and radiological examinations were performed; the constant score was measured as well. After the operation, the surgical time, cost, pain (VAS scores), Popeye sign, cramping pain, constant scores, satisfaction level and the elbow flexion and forearm supination strength indices were recorded.

Results: Patients were followed for an average of 24 months. No significant differences in the clinical results for the constant scores, the forearm supination and elbow flexion strength indices, Popeye sign, cramping pain and satisfaction level were found between the groups. However, tenotomy required a shorter surgical time (40.4 ± 4.0 vs. 50.4 ± 5.9 min, P < 0.001) and resulted in faster pain relief (3.1 ± 1.8 vs. 4.8 ± 1.9, P < 0.001).

Conclusion: Both tenotomy and tenodesis are effective and equal for the treatment of long head biceps lesions.

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of the two procedures in patients older than 55 years of age affected by reparable rotator cuff tears with concomitant long head biceps pathologies.

Methods: Patients older than 55 years of age with long head biceps lesions and reparable rotator cuff tears were selected for this study. A total of 151 patients were randomly assigned to the tenotomy group (77 patients) or the tenodesis group (74 patients). Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was performed in all the patients. The primary outcome was the constant score. Before surgery, physical and radiological examinations were performed; the constant score was measured as well. After the operation, the surgical time, cost, pain (VAS scores), Popeye sign, cramping pain, constant scores, satisfaction level and the elbow flexion and forearm supination strength indices were recorded.

Results: Patients were followed for an average of 24 months. No significant differences in the clinical results for the constant scores, the forearm supination and elbow flexion strength indices, Popeye sign, cramping pain and satisfaction level were found between the groups. Tenotomy required a shorter surgical time (40.4 ± 4.0 vs. 50.4 ± 5.9 min, P < 0.001) and resulted in faster pain relief (3.1 ± 1.8 vs. 4.8 ± 1.9, P < 0.001).

However, there are unanswered questions about the performance of hemiarthroplasty over the longer term compared with internal fixation.

Questions/purposes: We sought to compare hemiarthroplasty with internal fixation in terms of (1) outcomes scores for pain, hip function, and quality of life at a minimum of 5 years after surgery in a randomized trial. A secondary purpose was to compare (2) patient survival and (3) frequency of reoperation in the two groups.

Methods: A total of 222 consecutive patients older than 60 years, including those cognitively impaired, with FNF were randomized to either internal fixation with two parallel screws or bipolar hemiarthroplasty. At a minimum followup of 4.9 years (mean, 5.9 years; range, 4.9-7.2 years), 68 of the 70 surviving patients were examined by a study nurse and study physiotherapist blinded to initial treatment. Questionnaires on hip function (Harris hip score), quality of life (Eq5D), and activity of daily living function (Barthel ADL) were administered. The Barthel ADL index score was split into good function (score 95 or 100) and reduced function (score below 95).

Results: The mean survival of the groups was similar with 66.4% (73 of 110) of the patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty and 70.5% (79 of 112) of the patients undergoing internal fixation having died since surgery (p = 0.51). Only 12 of 31 living patients in the internal fixation group had retained their native hips at a mean of 6 years.

The mean Harris hip score was 66 (SD 19) and 67 (SD 20) in the internal fixation and hemiarthroplasty groups, respectively (p = 0.96).

Most MIS TKA surgeons (and many surgeons who use other approaches as well) excise the fat pad for better exposure of the knee. There is still controversy about the result of fat pad excision on patella baja, pain, and function.

Questions/purposes: In the setting of a randomized controlled trial, we sought to determine whether infrapatellar fat pad excision during MIS TKA causes (1) patellar tendon shortening (as measured by patella baja); (2) increased anterior knee pain; (3) decreases in the Knee Society Score or functional subscore; or (4) more patella-related complications.

Methods: We randomized 90 patients undergoing MIS TKA at one institution into two groups. In one group, 45 patients underwent MIS TKA with complete infrapatellar fat pad excision and in the other group, 45 patients received MIS TKA without infrapatellar fat pad excision. The patella was selectively resurfaced in these patients; there was no difference between the groups in terms of the percentage of patients whose patellae were resurfaced. We measured patellar tendon shortening, knee flexion, anterior knee pain, Knee Society Score (KSS), functional subscore, and patellar complications at preoperative and postoperative periods of 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year; complete followup data were available on 86% of patients (77 of 90) who were enrolled.

Results: At the final followup, no significant differences were observed in patellar tendon shortening, KSS, functional subscore, or knee flexion in either group. However, patients with their infrapatellar fat pad excised experienced more anterior knee pain (8.3% versus 0%; p = 0.03; 95% confidence interval, -0.007 to 0.174) at the end of the study. No patellar complications were found in either group.

block (FNB) after TKA.
METHODS: Ninety-four patients undergoing unilateral TKA were prospectively 
randomized to receive a spinal-epidural analgesic infusion plus a 
single-injection FNB or a spinal anesthetic plus a continuous postoperative 
intraarticular infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine. All patients were blinded to their

quadriceps strength, WOMAC scores, Knee Society scores, early postoperative 
ambulatory ability, in-hospital falls). All complications and adverse events

RESULTS: The frequency of nausea and hypertension was not different between the

versus 1.93, respectively, p = 0.008). After 24 hours, pain scores were similar 
between groups. Narcotic consumption was higher in the ropivacaine 
group on the day of surgery, but overall in-hospital narcotic usage was similar 
between groups. There were no differences in functional 
recovery between groups at any time point. Patients in the epidural group 
were more likely to have knee buckling (32.7% versus 6.7%, p = 0.002) and

because of their ability to engage the reader. Our objective was to evaluate the 
effectiveness of story booklets compared to standard information sheets for 
parents of children attending the emergency department (ED) with a child with 
croup.
METHODS: Parents were randomized to receive story booklets (n=208) or standard 
information sheets (n=205) during their ED visit. The primary outcome was change 
in anxiety between triage to ED discharge as measured by the State-Trait Anxiety 
Inventory. Follow-up telephone interviews were conducted at 1 and 3 days after 
discharge, then every other day until 9 days (or until resolution of symptoms), 
and at 1 year. Secondary outcomes included: expected future anxiety, event 
impact, parental knowledge, satisfaction, decision regret, healthcare

RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the primary outcome of change in 
parental anxiety between recruitment and ED discharge (change of 5 points for 
the story group vs. 6 points for the comparison group, p=0.78). The story group 
showed significantly greater decision regret regarding their decision to go to

determine whether a scalable, low-cost, unidirectional, text message-based 
mobile health intervention (TExT-MED) improves clinical outcomes, increases 
healthy behaviors, and decreases ED utilization in a safety net population.
METHODS: We conducted an randomized controlled trial of 128 adult patients with 
poorly controlled diabetes (glycosylated hemoglobin [Hb A1C] level в‰Ґ8%) in an 
urban, public ED. The TExT-MED group received 2 daily text messages for 6 months

outcomes included changes in medication adherence, self-efficacy, performance of 
self-care tasks, quality of life, diabetes-specific knowledge, ED utilization,

RESULTS: Hb A1C level decreased by 1.05% in the TExT-MED group compared with

236,24384945,No difference in blood loss between posterior-cruciate-ligament-retaining and posterior-cruciate-ligament-stabilized total knee arthroplasties.,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy",  Other,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"PURPOSE: Posterior-cruciate-ligament-retaining (PCR) and 
posterior-cruciate-ligament-stabilized (PS) arthroplasties are two major common 
practices in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The hypothesis of the present study 
was that compared with the PCR technique, the PS technique is associated with a 
higher amount of postoperative blood loss and greater need for blood transfusion 
in cemented TKA.
METHODS: In this prospective, randomized study, 100 patients diagnosed with 
primary knee osteoarthritis were randomly assigned to either the PCR group 
(Group I) or the PS group (Group II). The exclusion criteria were 
rheumatological joint disease, previous knee surgery, anticoagulant therapy and 
hypertension. There were no significant differences in age, body mass index and 
gender, between the groups. The haemoglobin and haematocrit levels of each 
patient were recorded preoperatively and on postoperative days 1, 3 and 5. The 
postoperative suction drainage and blood transfusion volumes were also recorded.
RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in haemoglobin or 
haematocrit levels between the groups on postoperative days 1, 3 and 5. There 
were also no statistically significant differences in the total measured blood 
loss volume, postoperative drainage amounts or transfusion rates between the 
groups.
CONCLUSION: Use of the PS technique during cemented TKA does not appear to 
influence the amount of perioperative blood loss or the need for postoperative

237,24384945,No difference in blood loss between posterior-cruciate-ligament-retaining and posterior-cruciate-ligament-stabilized total knee arthroplasties.,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy",  Other,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"PURPOSE: Posterior-cruciate-ligament-retaining (PCR) and 
posterior-cruciate-ligament-stabilized (PS) arthroplasties are two major common 
practices in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The hypothesis of the present study 
was that compared with the PCR technique, the PS technique is associated with a 
higher amount of postoperative blood loss and greater need for blood transfusion 
in cemented TKA.
METHODS: In this prospective, randomized study, 100 patients diagnosed with 
primary knee osteoarthritis were randomly assigned to either the PCR group 
(Group I) or the PS group (Group II). The exclusion criteria were 
rheumatological joint disease, previous knee surgery, anticoagulant therapy and 
hypertension. There were no significant differences in age, body mass index and 
gender, between the groups. The haemoglobin and haematocrit levels of each 
patient were recorded preoperatively and on postoperative days 1, 3 and 5. The 
postoperative suction drainage and blood transfusion volumes were also recorded.
RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in haemoglobin or 
haematocrit levels between the groups on postoperative days 1, 3 and 5. There 
were also no statistically significant differences in the total measured blood 
loss volume, postoperative drainage amounts or transfusion rates between the 
groups.
CONCLUSION: The PS technique was not more effective than the PCR technique in 
reducing postoperative blood loss or blood transfusion requirements in patients 
with primary knee osteoarthritis undergoing cemented TKA.",spin,4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.7583935856819153, 'probability': 0.46841830015182495}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.006289332173764706, 'probability': 0.9937304854393005}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.38562241196632385, 'probability': 0.680027186870575}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.004591754637658596, 'probability': 0.9954187870025635}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.5673050880432129, 'probability': 0.5670515298843384}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.004319266881793737, 'probability': 0.9956899881362915}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.0474424362182617, 'probability': 0.35083386301994324}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.009038367308676243, 'probability': 0.9910023212432861}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -1.0672763586044312, 'probability': 0.3439440131187439}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.006563415750861168, 'probability': 0.9934580326080322}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]"

192,24664198,Effectiveness of sustained stretching of the inferior capsule in the management of a frozen shoulder.,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,  Other,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Background: Physiotherapy treatment of frozen shoulder is varied, but most lack specific focus on the underlying disorder, which is the adhered shoulder capsule. Although positive effects were found after physiotherapy, the recurrence and prolonged disability of a frozen shoulder are major factors to focus on to provide the appropriate treatment.

Questions/purposes: We wished to study the effectiveness of a shoulder countertraction apparatus on ROM, pain, and function in patients with a frozen shoulder and compare their results with those of control subjects who received conventional physiotherapy.

Methods: A total of 100 participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group and a control group, with each group having 50 participants. The control group received physiotherapy and the experimental group received countertraction and physiotherapy. The total treatment time was 20 minutes a day for 5 days per week for 2 weeks. The outcome measures used were goniometer measurements, VAS, and the Oxford Shoulder Score.

Results: Improvements were seen in the scores for shoulder flexion (94.1Ў ± 19.79Ў at baseline increased to 161.9Ў ± 13.05Ў after intervention), abduction ROM (90.4Ў ± 21.18Ў at baseline increased to 154.8Ў ± 13.21Ў after intervention), and pain (8.00 ± 0.78 at baseline decreased to 3.48 ± 0.71 after intervention) in the experimental group.

193,24664198,Effectiveness of sustained stretching of the inferior capsule in the management of a frozen shoulder.,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,  Other,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"Background: Physiotherapy treatment of frozen shoulder is varied, but most lack specific focus on the underlying disorder, which is the adhered shoulder capsule. Although positive effects were found after physiotherapy, the recurrence and prolonged disability of a frozen shoulder are major factors to focus on to provide the appropriate treatment.

Questions/purposes: We wished to study the effectiveness of a shoulder countertraction apparatus on ROM, pain, and function in patients with a frozen shoulder and compare their results with those of control subjects who received conventional physiotherapy.

Methods: A total of 100 participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group and a control group, with each group having 50 participants. The control group received physiotherapy and the experimental group received countertraction and physiotherapy. The total treatment time was 20 minutes a day for 5 days per week for 2 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Oxford Shoulder Score. Secondary outcome measures included goniometer measurements for range of motion and VAS for pain assessment.

Results: For the primary outcome, 60% of participants (n = 30) achieved the fourth stage of satisfactory joint function according to the Oxford Shoulder Score in the experimental group compared with 18% (n = 9) in the control group (p < 0.001). For secondary outcomes, shoulder flexion improved from 94.1° ± 19.79° at baseline to 161.9° ± 13.05° after intervention in the experimental group. Shoulder abduction ROM improved from 90.4° ± 21.18° at baseline to 154.8° ± 13.21° after intervention in the experimental group. Pain scores decreased from 8.00 ± 0.78 at baseline to 3.48 ± 0.71 after intervention in the experimental group.

However, recent basic science and clinical data have suggested recurrent instability may be reduced with immobilization in external rotation after primary shoulder dislocation.

Questions/purposes: We performed a randomized controlled trial to compare the (1) frequency of recurrent instability and (2) disease-specific quality-of-life scores after treatment of first-time shoulder dislocation using either immobilization in external rotation or immobilization in internal rotation in a group of young patients.

Methods: Sixty patients younger than 35 years of age with primary, traumatic, anterior shoulder dislocations were randomized (concealed, computer-generated) to immobilization with either an internal rotation sling (n = 29) or an external rotation brace (n = 31) at a mean of 4 days after closed reduction (range, 1-7 days). Patients with large bony lesions or polytrauma were excluded. The two groups were similar at baseline. Both groups were immobilized for 4 weeks with identical therapy protocols thereafter. Blinded assessments were completed by independent observers for a minimum of 12 months (mean, 25 months; range, 12-43 months). The primary outcome was recurrent instability, defined as a second documented anterior dislocation or multiple episodes of shoulder subluxation severe enough for the patient to request surgical stabilization. Secondary outcomes included validated disease-specific quality-of-life data (Western Ontario Shoulder Instability index [WOSI], American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons evaluation [ASES]). Ten patients (17%, five from each group) were lost to followup. Reported compliance with immobilization in both groups was excellent (80%).

However, recent basic science and clinical data have suggested recurrent instability may be reduced with immobilization in external rotation after primary shoulder dislocation.

Questions/purposes: We performed a randomized controlled trial to compare the (1) frequency of recurrent instability and (2) disease-specific quality-of-life scores after treatment of first-time shoulder dislocation using either immobilization in external rotation or immobilization in internal rotation in a group of young patients.

Methods: Sixty patients younger than 35 years of age with primary, traumatic, anterior shoulder dislocations were randomized (concealed, computer-generated) to immobilization with either an internal rotation sling (n = 29) or an external rotation brace (n = 31) at a mean of 4 days after closed reduction (range, 1-7 days). Patients with large bony lesions or polytrauma were excluded. The two groups were similar at baseline. Both groups were immobilized for 4 weeks with identical therapy protocols thereafter. Blinded assessments were completed by independent observers for a minimum of 12 months (mean, 25 months; range, 12-43 months). Recurrent instability was defined as a second documented anterior dislocation or multiple episodes of shoulder subluxation severe enough for the patient to request surgical stabilization. Validated disease-specific quality-of-life data (Western Ontario Shoulder Instability index [WOSI], American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons evaluation [ASES]) were also collected. Ten patients (17%, five from each group) were lost to followup. Reported compliance with immobilization in both groups was excellent (80%).

Results: With the numbers available, there was no difference in the rate of recurrent instability between groups: 10 of 27 patients (37%) with the external rotation brace versus 10 of 25 patients (40%) with the sling redislocated or developed symptomatic recurrent instability (p = 0.41). WOSI scores were not different between groups (p = 0.74) and, although the difference in ASES scores approached statistical significance (p = 0.05), the magnitude of this difference was small and of uncertain clinical importance.

Conclusions: Despite previous published findings, our results show immobilization in external rotation did not confer a significant benefit versus sling immobilization in the prevention of recurrent instability after primary anterior shoulder dislocation. Further studies with larger numbers may elucidate whether functional outcomes, compliance, or comfort with immobilization can be improved with this device.",no_spin,5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -0.25519466400146484, 'probability': 0.7747656106948853}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0035908047575503588, 'probability': 0.9964156150817871}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.5189673900604248, 'probability': 0.5951347351074219}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.005200904794037342, 'probability': 0.9948126077651978}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -0.8491829633712769, 'probability': 0.42776429653167725}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0031147319823503494, 'probability': 0.996890127658844}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.0995789766311646, 'probability': 0.3330112397670746}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.007593694608658552, 'probability': 0.992435097694397}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -0.9950916767120361, 'probability': 0.3696895241737366}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.003104987321421504, 'probability': 0.9968997836112976}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]"

placebo for adults with undifferentiated emergency department (ED) nausea and 
vomiting.
METHODS: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was 
conducted in 2 metropolitan EDs in Melbourne, Australia. Eligible patients with 
ED nausea and vomiting were randomized to receive 4 mg intravenous ondansetron, 
20 mg intravenous metoclopramide, or saline solution placebo. Primary outcome 
was mean change in visual analog scale (VAS) rating of nausea severity from 
enrollment to 30 minutes after study drug administration. Secondary outcomes 
included patient satisfaction, need for rescue antiemetic treatment, and adverse 
events.
RESULTS: Of 270 recruited patients, 258 (95.6%) were available for analysis. Of 
these patients, 87 (33.7%) received ondansetron; 88 (34.1%), metoclopramide; and 
83 (32.2%), placebo. Baseline characteristics between treatment groups and 
recruitment site were similar. Mean decrease in VAS score was 27 mm (95% 
confidence interval [CI] 22 to 33 mm) for ondansetron, 28 mm (95% CI 22 to 34 
mm) for metoclopramide, and 23 mm (95% CI 16 to 30 mm) for placebo. Satisfaction 
with treatment was reported by 54.1% (95% CI 43.5% to 64.5%), 61.6% (95% CI 
51.0% to 71.4%), and 59.5% (95% CI 48.4% to 69.9%) for ondansetron, 
metoclopramide, and placebo, respectively; rescue medication was required by 
34.5% (95% CI 25.0% to 45.1%), 17.9% (95% CI 10.8% to 27.2%), and 36.3% (95% CI 
26.3% to 47.2%), respectively. Nine minor adverse events were reported.
CONCLUSION: Reductions in nausea severity for this adult ED nausea and vomiting 
population were similar for 4 mg intravenous ondansetron, 20 mg intravenous 
metoclopramide, and placebo. There was a trend toward greater reductions in VAS 
ratings and a lesser requirement for rescue medication in the antiemetic drug 
groups, but differences from the placebo group did not reach significance. The

kinetic chain resistance training on anterior knee laxity and function in the 
ACL-injured (ACLI) knee.
METHODS: Fifty-eight ACLI subjects were randomised to one of three (12-week 
duration) training groups. The STAND group trained according to a standardised 
rehabilitation protocol. Subjects in the LOW and HIGH group trained as did the 
STAND group but with the addition of seated knee extensor open kinetic chain 
resistance training at loads of 2 sets of 20 repetition maximum (RM) and 20 sets 
of 2RM, respectively. Anterior knee laxity and measurements of physical and 
subjective function were performed at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks. Thirty-six 
subjects were tested at both baseline and 12 weeks (STAND n = 13, LOW n = 11, 
HIGH n = 12).
RESULTS: The LOW group demonstrated a reduction in 133 N anterior knee laxity 
between baseline and 12 weeks testing when compared to the HIGH and the STAND

average of approximately 5 mm in the LOW group while remaining the same in the

CONCLUSION: Twelve weeks of knee extensor open kinetic chain resistance training 
at loads of 2 sets of 20RM led to a reduction in anterior knee laxity in the

RESULTS: Fifty-four subjects (mean age, 23В years; 37 women) were randomized to

METHODS: Ninety patients undergoing primary TKA were involved and randomly

stimulation of the common fibular nerve, which produced a brisk dorsiflexion of 
the ankle, was performed for the operated leg during surgery. In the control

navigation enables intraoperative control of leg length equalization and offset 
reconstruction. However, the effect of navigation compared with intraoperative 
fluoroscopy is unclear.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether intraoperative use of imageless navigation 
(1) improves the relative accuracy of leg length and global and femoral offset 
restoration; (2) increases the absolute precision of leg length and global and 
femoral offset equalization; and (3) reduces outliers in a reconstruction zone 
of В± 5 mm for leg length and global and femoral offset restoration compared with 
intraoperative fluoroscopy during minimally invasive (MIS) THA with the patient 
in a lateral decubitus position.
METHODS: In this prospective study a consecutive series of 125 patients were 
randomized to either navigation-guided or fluoroscopy-controlled THA using 
sealed, opaque envelopes. All patients received the same cementless prosthetic 
components through an anterolateral MIS approach while they were in a lateral 
decubitus position. Leg length, global or total offset (representing the 
combination of femoral and acetabular offset), and femoral offset differences 
were restored using either navigation or fluoroscopy. Postoperatively, residual 
leg length and global and femoral offset discrepancies were analyzed on 
magnification-corrected radiographs of the pelvis by an independent and blinded 
examiner using digital planning software. Accuracy was defined as the relative 
postoperative difference between the surgically treated and the unaffected 
contralateral side for leg length and offset, respectively; precision was 
defined as the absolute postoperative deviation of leg length and global and 
femoral offset regardless of lengthening or shortening of leg length and offset 
throughout the THA. All analyses were performed per intention-to-treat.
RESULTS: Analyzing the relative accuracy of leg length restoration we found a 
mean difference of 0.2 mm (95% CI, -1.0 to +1.4 mm; p = 0.729) between 
fluoroscopy and navigation, 0.2 mm (95 % CI, -0.9 to +1.3 mm; p = 0.740) for 
global offset and 1.7 mm (95 % CI, +0.4 to +2.9 mm; p = 0.008) for femoral 
offset. For the absolute precision of leg length and global and femoral offset 
equalization, there was a mean difference of 1.7 В± 0.3 mm (p < 0.001) between 
fluoroscopy and navigation. The biomechanical reconstruction with a residual leg

emergency departments and is associated with important health expenses. However, 
the appropriate care of this traumatic injury remains a matter of debate. We 
tested the hypothesis that compression stockings speed up recovery from ankle 
sprain.
METHODS: Recent (<48 hours) cases of ankle sprain without other traumatic injury 
in patients aged between 18 and 55 years were included. Patients were randomly 
allocated to placebo Jersey or class II compression stockings (Venoflex; 
Thuasne, Levallois-Perret, France). The primary end point was the time to 
recovery of normal painless walking without requirement for analgesic drug. 
Secondary end points were time to return to sport activity, pain, analgesic 
consumption, and ankle edema (bimalleolar and midfoot circumferences).
RESULTS: We randomized 126 patients and analyzed 117 patients (60 in the placebo 
group and 57 in the compression group). The median time to normal painless

43,25043629,Compression stockings in ankle sprain: a multicenter randomized study.,The American Journal of Emergency Medicine,RESULTS: Focus on (+) subgroup analysis,Claim benefit based on (+) subgroup analysis,Emergency Medicine,claude_4.0-sonnet,"OBJECTIVES: Ankle sprain is a frequently encountered traumatic injury in 
emergency departments and is associated with important health expenses. However, 
the appropriate care of this traumatic injury remains a matter of debate. We 
tested the hypothesis that compression stockings speed up recovery from ankle 
sprain.
METHODS: Recent (<48 hours) cases of ankle sprain without other traumatic injury 
in patients aged between 18 and 55 years were included. Patients were randomly 
allocated to placebo Jersey or class II compression stockings (Venoflex; 
Thuasne, Levallois-Perret, France). The primary end point was the time to 
recovery of normal painless walking without requirement for analgesic drug. 
Secondary end points were time to return to sport activity, pain, analgesic 
consumption, and ankle edema (bimalleolar and midfoot circumferences).
RESULTS: We randomized 126 patients and analyzed 117 patients (60 in the placebo 
group and 57 in the compression group). The median time to normal painless 
walking was not significantly decreased (P = .16). No significant differences 
were observed in pain, analgesic consumption, and bimalleolar and midfoot

in subjects undergoing assessment for acute angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitor-induced angioedema (ACEIA) in an emergency department (ED).
METHODS: This was a multicenter, phase 2, double-blind study with subjects 
randomized to receive a single subcutaneous dose of ecallantide (10, 30, or 60 
mg) or placebo plus physician-directed conventional therapy. The primary 
endpoint was defined as meeting predetermined discharge eligibility criteria 
within 6 hours of study drug administration. Discharge criteria included 
improvement of edema, stable vital signs, absence of stridor, absence of dyspnea 
or use of accessory muscles during respiration, absence of drooling, and ability 
to drink without difficulty.
RESULTS: An interim analysis showed that a high percentage of subjects met the 
primary endpoint, and the study was halted. Overall, 79 subjects were randomized

CONCLUSION: The addition of ecallantide to standard therapy does not appear to 
improve angioedema compared with placebo in ED patients with ACEIA. Our data 
suggest that most ED patients presenting with mild to moderate ACEIA are likely 
to meet our discharge eligibility criteria within 6 hours of treatment,

Prospective randomized comparison between ultrasound-guided needling and extracorporeal shock wave therapy.,Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery,,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"HYPOTHESIS: Ultrasound (US)-guided needling with subacromial corticosteroid 
injection is more effective than extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) for 
function restoration and pain relief in patients with calcific tendinitis of the 
shoulder.
METHODS: Fifty-four patients diagnosed with unilateral painful calcific 
tendinitis were randomly allocated to a US needling or ESWT group. The US 
needling group underwent US-guided needling and received a subacromial 
corticosteroid injection. The ESWT group received ESWT 3 times a week. All 
patients were prospectively evaluated; American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, 
Simple Shoulder Test, and visual analog scale for pain scores were recorded 
before the procedure and at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, and the last 
follow-up. The size and morphology of the deposits were evaluated by 
radiography.

Prospective randomized comparison between ultrasound-guided needling and extracorporeal shock wave therapy.,Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery,,Other,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"HYPOTHESIS: Ultrasound (US)-guided needling with subacromial corticosteroid 
injection is more effective than extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) for 
function restoration and pain relief in patients with calcific tendinitis of the 
shoulder.
METHODS: Fifty-four patients diagnosed with unilateral painful calcific 
tendinitis were randomly allocated to a US needling or ESWT group. The US 
needling group underwent US-guided needling and received a subacromial 
corticosteroid injection. The ESWT group received ESWT 3 times a week. All 
patients were prospectively evaluated; American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, 
Simple Shoulder Test, and visual analog scale for pain scores were recorded 
before the procedure and at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, and the last 
follow-up. The size and morphology of the deposits were evaluated by 
radiography.
RESULTS: The average follow-up period was 23.0 months. At last follow-up, the 
mean size of the deposits was significantly different between the 2 groups (P = 
.001); it decreased to 0.5 mm from 14.8 mm in the US needling group and to 5.6 
mm from 11.0 mm in the ESWT group. There were also significant improvements in 
clinical outcomes in both groups after treatment (P < .05). At 1-year follow-up, 
the US needling group had significantly better scores than the ESWT group with 
regard to the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons assessment (90.3 and 74.6, 
respectively; P = .001), Simple Shoulder Test (83.3 and 70.8, respectively; P = 
.015), and visual analog scale for pain (1.4 and 3.3, respectively; P = 
.003).The initial calcium deposit sizes and clinical outcomes were weakly 
correlated in both groups (P > .05).

epinephrine, and cefazolin, n = 42), Group 1 (ropivacaine, n = 43), Group 2 
(ropivacaine + morphine, n = 43), Group 3 (ropivacaine + ketorolac, n = 42), 
Group 4 (ropivacaine + morphine + ketorolac, n = 43), and Group 5 (ropivacaine + 
morphine + ketorolac + methylprednisolone, n = 43). Pain level assessed by 
visual analogue scale (VAS) and opioid consumption were primary outcomes. The 
incidence of complications, range of motion (ROM), C-reactive protein (CRP) 
value, and the amount of post-operative blood drainage were also compared.
RESULTS: Patients in Groups 4 and 5 complained less pain than the control group 
for the first 12 h after surgery, and the patients in the other groups showed 
less pain only during the initial 6 h after surgery. Groups 4 and 5 also showed 
less opioid consumption than the control group during the 24 h period after 
surgery. Patients in Group 5 showed no significant difference in VAS score and 
opioid consumption compared with Group 4, but they had lower CRP value and 
greater ROM than any other groups at post-operative day 2 and day 4.
CONCLUSION: Group 4 (ropivacaine + morphine + ketorolac) was not more effective 
on pain level and opioid consumption than Group 5 (ropivacaine + morphine + 
ketorolac + methylprednisolone) in patients undergoing TKA for primary 
osteoarthritis.",spin,7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -0.8267202377319336, 'probability': 0.43748176097869873}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0052979071624577045, 'probability': 0.9947160482406616}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.4572142958641052, 'probability': 0.6330446600914001}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.004738411866128445, 'probability': 0.9952728748321533}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -0.8743429183959961, 'probability': 0.417136013507843}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.005204224959015846, 'probability': 0.9948092699050903}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.3600976467132568, 'probability': 0.25663572549819946}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.01471969485282898, 'probability': 0.9853881001472473}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.1708401441574097, 'probability': 0.3101063072681427}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.006116007454693317, 'probability': 0.9939026832580566}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]"

knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been well documented, the gold standard for drug 
combination has not yet been established. In this study, the analgesic effects 
of six different drug combinations were compared.
METHODS: A total of 256 patients undergoing TKA for primary osteoarthritis were 
randomized into one of six groups: a control group (saline solution, 
epinephrine, and cefazolin, n = 42), Group 1 (ropivacaine, n = 43), Group 2 
(ropivacaine + morphine, n = 43), Group 3 (ropivacaine + ketorolac, n = 42), 
Group 4 (ropivacaine + morphine + ketorolac, n = 43), and Group 5 (ropivacaine +

RESULTS: Patients in Groups 4 and 5 complained less pain than the control group

opioid consumption compared with Group 4, but they had lower CRP value and 
greater ROM than any other groups at post-operative day 2 and day 4.
CONCLUSION: The combination of ropivacaine, morphine, and ketorolac showed a 
significantly stronger and sufficiently synergistic analgesic effect without 
adding methylprednisolone in periarticular injection after TKA. The clinical 
relevance of the study is that the combination of ropivacaine, morphine, and 
ketorolac can be a good option for periarticular injection following TKA in

ganglion block for the treatment of acute anterior headache in the emergency 
department (ED) using a novel noninvasive delivery device.
METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial 
evaluating bupivacaine anesthesia of the sphenopalatine ganglion for acute 
anterior or global-based headache. This study was completed in 2 large academic 
EDs. Bupivacaine or normal saline solution was delivered intranasally (0.3 mL 
per side) with the Tx360 device. Pain and nausea were measured at 0, 5, and 15 
minutes by a 100-mm visual analog scale. The primary endpoint was a 50% 
reduction in pain at 15 minutes. Telephone follow-up assessed 24-hour pain and 
nausea through a 0- to 10-point verbal scale and adverse effects.
RESULTS: The median reported baseline pain in the bupivacaine group was 80 mm 
(IQR 66 mm - 93 mm) and 78.5 mm (IQR 64 mm to 91.75 mm) in the normal saline 
solution group. A 50% reduction in pain was achieved in 48.8% of the bupivacaine 
group (20/41 patients) versus 41.3% in the normal saline solution group (19/46

the rotator cuff (RC) tear has not been well clarified.
PURPOSE: To compare the clinical results between patients who had distal 
clavicle resection (DCR) and those who did not during RC repair.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: From August 2008 to December 2009, a total of 56 consecutive patients 
(58 shoulders) were included. All patients had either a full-thickness or 
high-grade (>50%) RC tear, ACJ tenderness, arthritic change visible on plain 
radiographs, and a positive ACJ lidocaine injection test the day before surgery. 
Patients were randomized into 2 groups: DCR and RC repair (DCR+RCR group) and RC 
repair only (isolated RCR). Evaluation was performed preoperatively, at 6 months 
postoperatively, and at a final follow-up a minimum of 24 months postoperatively 
using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, the Constant 
shoulder score, range of motion examination, and pain visual analog scale (VAS).
RESULTS: After simple randomization, 26 shoulders were allocated in the DCR+RCR 
group, and 32 were placed in the isolated RCR group. Five shoulders in the 
DCR+RCR group and 6 in the isolated RCR group were excluded from analysis due to 
loss of follow-up. Therefore, the evaluation was performed for 21 shoulders in 
the DCR+RCR group and 26 shoulders in the isolated RCR group. The mean follow-up 
period was 44.2 months in the DCR+RCR group and 44.0 months in the isolated RCR 
group. There were no differences in age, sex, symptom duration, RC tear size, or 
preoperative ASES, Constant, and VAS scores between the 2 groups (P > .05). At 
final follow-up, the ASES, Constant, and VAS scores were significantly improved 
in both groups (P < .001). There were no differences in ASES, Constant, and VAS 
scores between the 2 groups at final follow-up (P > .05), and there was no 
difference in residual ACJ tenderness (7 in the DCR+RCR group and 5 in the 
isolated RCR group) between the 2 groups (P = .270).
CONCLUSION: There was no difference in the clinical evaluations between the

the rotator cuff (RC) tear has not been well clarified.
PURPOSE: To compare the clinical results between patients who had distal 
clavicle resection (DCR) and those who did not during RC repair.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: From August 2008 to December 2009, a total of 56 consecutive patients 
(58 shoulders) were included. All patients had either a full-thickness or 
high-grade (>50%) RC tear, ACJ tenderness, arthritic change visible on plain 
radiographs, and a positive ACJ lidocaine injection test the day before surgery. 
Patients were randomized into 2 groups: DCR and RC repair (DCR+RCR group) and RC 
repair only (isolated RCR). The primary outcome was the American Shoulder and 
Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score. Secondary outcomes included the Constant shoulder 
score, range of motion examination, and pain visual analog scale (VAS). 
Evaluation was performed preoperatively, at 6 months postoperatively, and at a 
final follow-up a minimum of 24 months postoperatively.
RESULTS: After simple randomization, 26 shoulders were allocated in the DCR+RCR 
group, and 32 were placed in the isolated RCR group. Five shoulders in the 
DCR+RCR group and 6 in the isolated RCR group were excluded from analysis due to 
loss of follow-up. Therefore, the evaluation was performed for 21 shoulders in 
the DCR+RCR group and 26 shoulders in the isolated RCR group. The mean follow-up 
period was 44.2 months in the DCR+RCR group and 44.0 months in the isolated RCR 
group. There were no differences in age, sex, symptom duration, RC tear size, or 
preoperative ASES, Constant, and VAS scores between the 2 groups (P > .05). At 
final follow-up, there were no differences in ASES, Constant, and VAS scores 
between the 2 groups (P > .05), and there was no difference in residual ACJ 
tenderness (7 in the DCR+RCR group and 5 in the isolated RCR group) between the 
2 groups (P = .270).
CONCLUSION: DCR was not more effective on the ASES score than isolated RCR in 
patients with symptomatic ACJ arthritis and RC tears.",spin,4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.5622340440750122, 'probability': 0.5699343681335449}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.004800224211066961, 'probability': 0.9952112436294556}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.6755191087722778, 'probability': 0.5088921785354614}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.003581420984119177, 'probability': 0.9964250326156616}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.7927802801132202, 'probability': 0.45258471369743347}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.004791326355189085, 'probability': 0.9952201247215271}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.2241239547729492, 'probability': 0.29401516914367676}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0051985327154397964, 'probability': 0.994814932346344}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -1.2006516456604004, 'probability': 0.3009980320930481}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.004898452199995518, 'probability': 0.9951134920120239}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]"

Even though there was an increased use of plasma and platelets transfused in the 1:1:1 group, no other safety differences were identified between the 2 groups.",no_spin,6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.673491358757019, 'probability': 0.509925127029419}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00590935256332159, 'probability': 0.9941080808639526}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",9,9,"[{'token': 24, 'token_string': '9', 'logits': -0.425620436668396, 'probability': 0.6533643007278442}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.003108076984062791, 'probability': 0.9968966841697693}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.4209199845790863, 'probability': 0.6564425826072693}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.004028064664453268, 'probability': 0.9959800839424133}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.2779974937438965, 'probability': 0.27859464287757874}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0023371067363768816, 'probability': 0.9976656436920166}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.9084481000900269, 'probability': 0.4031493663787842}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.004930599592626095, 'probability': 0.9950815439224243}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]"

Methods: We randomly assigned patients with suspected stroke to receive either intravenous magnesium sulfate or placebo, beginning within 2 hours after symptom onset. A loading dose was initiated by paramedics before the patient arrived at the hospital, and a 24-hour maintenance infusion was started on the patient's arrival at the hospital.

To increase the likelihood that good alignment will be achieved during surgery, smart tools such as robotics or patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) have been introduced.
Questions/purposes:В We hypothesized that UKA performed with PSI would result in improved level gait as ascertained with three-dimensional analysis, implant positioning, and patient-reported outcomes measured by a validated scoring system when compared with conventional instrumentation 3 months and 1 year after surgery.
Methods:В We randomized 60 patients into two groups using either the PSI technique or a conventional technique. All patients were operated on using the same technique and the same cemented metal-backed implant. Mean age of the patients was 63 В± 4 years (range, 54-72 years) and mean body mass index was 28 В± 3 kg/m(2). Patients were evaluated preoperatively, at 3 months, and 1 year after surgery by an independent observer blind to the type of technique. Gait parameters were assessed with three-dimensional analysis during level walking preoperatively and at 1 year, frontal and sagittal position of the implant was evaluated on full-length radiographs at 3 months, and subjective functional outcome and quality of life using routine questionnaires (SF-12, new Knee Society Score [KSS], Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) at 3 months and 1 year. This study had 80% power to detect a 15% difference in walking speed at the p < 0.05 level.
Results:В One year after surgery, there were no differences between the two groups in the analyzed gait spatiotemporal parameters, respectively, for PSI UKA and conventional UKA : double limb support 31% (25%-54%) versus 30% (23%-56%; p = 0.67) and walking speed (1.59 m/s [0.86-1.87 m/s] versus 1.57 m/s [0.71-1.96 m/s]; p = 0.41). No difference was observed between the two groups in terms of lower limb alignment (PSI group 178В° В± 3В°, conventional group 178В° В± 4В°; p = 0.24) or implant positioning on mediolateral and anteroposterior radiographs. There were no differences in the functional score between the PSI and conventional TKA groups at 3 months and 1 year after surgery: KSS objective knee scores (PSI: 85 В± 8 points at 3 months, 87 В± 5 points at 1 year and conventional instrumentation: 82 В± 8 points at 3 months 83 В± 6 points at 1 year; p = 0.10) and functional activity scores were similar in both group (PSI: 71 В± 12 points at 3 months and 74 В± 7 points at 1 year versus conventional group: 73 В± 11 points at 3 months and 75 В± 6 at 1 year; p = 0.9).

defined. This trial was performed to assess the feasibility and safety of 
controlled resuscitation (CR) versus standard resuscitation (SR) in hypotensive 
trauma patients.
METHODS: Patients were enrolled and randomized in the out-of-hospital setting. 
Nineteen emergency medical services (EMS) systems in the Resuscitation Outcome 
Consortium participated. Eligible patients had an out-of-hospital systolic blood 
pressure (SBP) of 90 mm Hg or lower. CR patients received 250 mL of fluid if 
they had no radial pulse or an SBP lower than 70 mm Hg and additional 250-mL 
boluses to maintain a radial pulse or an SBP of 70 mm Hg or greater. The SR 
group patients received 2 L initially and additional fluid as needed to maintain 
an SBP of 110 mm Hg or greater. The crystalloid protocol was maintained until 
hemorrhage control or 2 hours after hospital arrival.
RESULTS: A total of 192 patients were randomized (97 CR and 95 SR). The CR and 
SR groups were similar at baseline. The mean (SD) crystalloid volume 
administered during the study period was 1.0 L (1.5) in the CR group and 2.0 L 
(1.4) in the SR group, a difference of 1.0 L (95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.6-1.4). Intensive care unit-free days, ventilator-free days, renal injury, and 
renal failure did not differ between the groups. At 24 hours after admission, 
there were 5 deaths (5%) in the CR group and 14 (15%) in the SR group (adjusted

defined. This trial was performed to assess the feasibility and safety of 
controlled resuscitation (CR) versus standard resuscitation (SR) in hypotensive 
trauma patients.
METHODS: Patients were enrolled and randomized in the out-of-hospital setting. 
Nineteen emergency medical services (EMS) systems in the Resuscitation Outcome 
Consortium participated. Eligible patients had an out-of-hospital systolic blood 
pressure (SBP) of 90 mm Hg or lower. CR patients received 250 mL of fluid if 
they had no radial pulse or an SBP lower than 70 mm Hg and additional 250-mL 
boluses to maintain a radial pulse or an SBP of 70 mm Hg or greater. The SR 
group patients received 2 L initially and additional fluid as needed to maintain 
an SBP of 110 mm Hg or greater. The crystalloid protocol was maintained until 
hemorrhage control or 2 hours after hospital arrival.
RESULTS: A total of 192 patients were randomized (97 CR and 95 SR). The CR and 
SR groups were similar at baseline. The mean (SD) crystalloid volume 
administered during the study period was 1.0 L (1.5) in the CR group and 2.0 L 
(1.4) in the SR group, a difference of 1.0 L (95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.6-1.4). Intensive care unit-free days, ventilator-free days, renal injury, and 
renal failure did not differ between the groups. At 24 hours after admission, 
there were 5 deaths (5%) in the CR group and 14 (15%) in the SR group (adjusted 
odds ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.12-1.26). Among patients with blunt trauma, 24-hour 
mortality was 3% (CR) and 18% (SR) with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.17 
(0.03-0.92). There was no difference among patients with penetrating trauma (9% 
vs. 9%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.93; 95% CI, 0.19-19.17).
CONCLUSION: CR is achievable in out-of-hospital and hospital settings and may 
offer an early survival advantage in blunt trauma. A large-scale, Phase III 
trial to examine its effects on survival and other clinical outcomes is 
warranted.",no_spin,7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -0.4185068607330322, 'probability': 0.6580286026000977}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.003489716211333871, 'probability': 0.9965164065361023}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.412921667098999, 'probability': 0.6617140769958496}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.004652508534491062, 'probability': 0.9953582286834717}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.6553038954734802, 'probability': 0.519284188747406}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.003231900045648217, 'probability': 0.9967733025550842}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.2394635677337646, 'probability': 0.28953951597213745}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.002873579505831003, 'probability': 0.9971305727958679}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.44722872972488403, 'probability': 0.6393976211547852}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.003850903594866395, 'probability': 0.9961565732955933}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]"

with neuroleptic antiemetics like metoclopramide. Haloperidol has been shown to 
be effective for migraine treatment.
STUDY OBJECTIVE: Our study compared the use of metoclopramide vs. haloperidol to 
treat ED migraine patients.
METHODS: A prospective, double-blinded, randomized control trial of 64 adults 
aged 18-50 years with migraine headache and no recognized risks for 
QT-prolongation. Haloperidol 5 mg or metoclopramide 10 mg was given 
intravenously after 25 mg diphenhydramine. Pain, nausea, restlessness 
(akathisia), and sedation were assessed with 100-mm visual analog scales (VAS) 
at baseline and every 20 min, to a maximum of 80 min. The primary outcome was 
pain relief. The need for rescue medications, side effects, and subject 
satisfaction were recorded. QTc intervals were measured prior to and after 
treatment. Follow-up calls after 48 h assessed satisfaction and recurrent or 
persistent symptoms.
RESULTS: Thirty-one subjects received haloperidol, 33 metoclopramide. The groups 
were similar on all VAS measurements, side effects, and in their satisfaction 
with therapy. Pain relief averaged 53 mm VAS over both groups, with equal times 
to maximum improvement. Subjects receiving haloperidol required rescue 
medication less often (3% vs. 24%, p < 0.02). Mean QTcs were equal 
and normal in the two groups and did not change after treatment. In telephone 
follow-up, 90% of subjects contacted were ""happy with the medication"" they had 
received, with haloperidol-treated subjects experiencing more restlessness (43%

12,26048068,A Randomized Controlled Trial of Intravenous Haloperidol vs. Intravenous Metoclopramide for Acute Migraine Therapy in the Emergency Department.,The Journal of Emergency Medicine,RESULTS: Focus on (+) secondary endpoint,,Emergency Medicine,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Emergency Department (ED) headache patients are commonly treated 
with neuroleptic antiemetics like metoclopramide. Haloperidol has been shown to 
be effective for migraine treatment.
STUDY OBJECTIVE: Our study compared the use of metoclopramide vs. haloperidol to 
treat ED migraine patients.
METHODS: A prospective, double-blinded, randomized control trial of 64 adults 
aged 18-50 years with migraine headache and no recognized risks for 
QT-prolongation. Haloperidol 5 mg or metoclopramide 10 mg was given 
intravenously after 25 mg diphenhydramine. Pain, nausea, restlessness 
(akathisia), and sedation were assessed with 100-mm visual analog scales (VAS) 
at baseline and every 20 min, to a maximum of 80 min. The need for rescue 
medications, side effects, and subject satisfaction were recorded. QTc intervals 
were measured prior to and after treatment. Follow-up calls after 48 h assessed 
satisfaction and recurrent or persistent symptoms.
RESULTS: Thirty-one subjects received haloperidol, 33 metoclopramide. The groups 
were similar on all VAS measurements, side effects, and in their satisfaction 
with therapy. Pain relief averaged 53 mm VAS over both groups, with equal times 
to maximum improvement. Subjects receiving haloperidol required rescue 
medication significantly less often (3% vs. 24%, p < 0.02). Mean QTcs were equal 
and normal in the two groups and did not change after treatment. In telephone 
follow-up, 90% of subjects contacted were ""happy with the medication"" they had 
received, with haloperidol-treated subjects experiencing more restlessness (43% 
vs. 10%).

164,26163281,Clinical performance of lateralized versus non-lateralized reverse shoulder arthroplasty: a prospective randomized study.,Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery,  Focus on (+) subgroup analysis,"""Trend toward significance"" // ""Numerically longer survival"" or equivalent verbiage, Claim benefit based on (+) subgroup analysis",Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) is an established therapeutic 
option in the treatment of cuff tear arthropathy (CTA). Recent studies have 
described a positive effect of lateralization of the center of rotation, 
especially on postoperative rotational function. The goal of this study is to 
compare the outcome of non-lateralized versus lateralized RSA with particular 
regard to rotational function in patients with CTA.
METHODS: Thirty-four patients underwent implantation of RSA either with 
lateralization (nВ =В 17) or without lateralization (nВ =В 17) by use of a 1-cm 
autologous bone graft (""bony increased offset"") of the humeral head for CTA. 
Clinical outcomes were measured with the Constant score; the Disabilities of the 
Arm, Shoulder and Hand score; and the Activities of Daily Living 
RequiringВ External Rotation score, as well as measurement of external rotation 
and determination of the external rotation lag sign with the arm at the side and 
at 90В° of abduction, at 1 year postoperatively and at final follow-up. Computed 
tomography scan evaluation was performed in all patients preoperatively and at 1 
year postoperatively to assess preoperative fatty infiltration of the rotator 
cuff and bony integration of the graft postoperatively.
RESULTS: At final follow-up, all patients showed significantly increased 
functional results. There were no significant differences in the evaluated 
parameters. If patients with degenerative changes of the teres minor were 
excluded, the lateralized group showed significantly increased external 
rotation. Bony integration of the graft could be verified on postoperative 
computed tomography scans in all patients.

Recent studies have described a positive effect of lateralization of the center of rotation, especially on postoperative rotational function. The goal of this study is to compare the outcome of non-lateralized versus lateralized RSA in patients with CTA.

METHODS: Thirty-four patients underwent implantation of RSA either with lateralization (n = 17) or without lateralization (n = 17) by use of a 1-cm autologous bone graft (""bony increased offset"") of the humeral head for CTA. Clinical outcomes were measured with the Constant score; the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score; and the Activities of Daily Living Requiring External Rotation score, as well as measurement of external rotation and determination of the external rotation lag sign with the arm at the side and at 90° of abduction, at 1 year postoperatively and at final follow-up. Computed tomography scan evaluation was performed in all patients preoperatively and at 1 year postoperatively to assess preoperative fatty infiltration of the rotator cuff and bony integration of the graft postoperatively.

RESULTS: At final follow-up, there were no significant differences in the evaluated parameters between the lateralized and non-lateralized groups. Bony integration of the graft could be verified on postoperative computed tomography scans in all patients.

CONCLUSION: Lateralized RSA was not more effective than non-lateralized RSA in patients with cuff tear arthropathy.",spin,4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.44624149799346924, 'probability': 0.6400291323661804}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.006823570933192968, 'probability': 0.9931996464729309}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.6053873300552368, 'probability': 0.5458629727363586}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.004413388203829527, 'probability': 0.9955963492393494}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.5863284468650818, 'probability': 0.5563663244247437}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.005319725722074509, 'probability': 0.9946944117546082}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.2330089807510376, 'probability': 0.29141440987586975}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.014886836521327496, 'probability': 0.9852234721183777}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -1.012110710144043, 'probability': 0.3634510040283203}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.007617237512022257, 'probability': 0.992411732673645}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]"

however, retear rates remain high. High-frequency, low-magnitude vibration has 
been demonstrated to promote new bone formation in both animal models and in 
humans.
HYPOTHESIS: This type of mechanical stimulation applied postoperatively will 
enhance tendon-to-bone healing and reduce postoperative retear rates.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was 
conducted to investigate the effects of 5 minutes of 80-Hz vibration applied 
daily after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair for 6 months on postoperative 
rotator cuff healing. The primary outcome was ultrasound-assessed repair 
integrity at 6 months after repair. Secondary outcomes included pain scores, 
shoulder range of motion, and shoulder strength. Recruited patients were randomized into 2 
groups: one group received a vibration device that oscillated at 80 Hz, and the 
other group received a placebo device.
RESULTS: The postoperative retear rates were 9.1% (5/55) 
in the vibration group, and 9.3% (5/54) in the placebo group at 6 months as 
determined by ultrasound imaging. Pain scores at 6 
weeks after surgery were 2.24 ± 0.29 cm in the vibration group compared 
with 3.67 ± 0.48 cm in the placebo group (P < .003). Six months after surgery, 
both groups had reductions in pain during overhead activities, at 
rest, and during sleep and overall shoulder pain compared with before surgery (P 
< .001). Both the vibration and placebo groups had increases in 
shoulder strength with abduction in the scapular plane, adduction, liftoff, 
internal rotation, and external rotation 6 months after surgery. Statistical

however, retear rates remain high. High-frequency, low-magnitude vibration has 
been demonstrated to promote new bone formation in both animal models and in 
humans.
HYPOTHESIS: This type of mechanical stimulation applied postoperatively will 
enhance tendon-to-bone healing and reduce postoperative retear rates.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was 
conducted to investigate the effects of 5 minutes of 80-Hz vibration applied 
daily after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair for 6 months on postoperative 
rotator cuff healing. The primary outcome was ultrasound-assessed repair 
integrity at 6 months after repair. Recruited patients were randomized into 2 
groups: one group received a vibration device that oscillated at 80 Hz, and the 
other group received a placebo device.
RESULTS: The postoperative retear rates of both groups were similar (9.1% [5/55] 
in the vibration group, and 9.3% [5/54] in the placebo group) at 6 months as 
determined by ultrasound imaging. Vibration did provide acute pain relief at 6 
weeks after surgery (visual analog scale [VAS] score, 2.24 В± 0.29 cm) compared 
with placebo (VAS score, 3.67 В± 0.48 cm) (P < .003). Six months after surgery, 
both groups had significant reductions in pain during overhead activities, at 
rest, and during sleep and overall shoulder pain compared with before surgery (P 
< .001). Both the vibration and placebo groups had significant increases in 
shoulder strength with abduction in the scapular plane, adduction, liftoff, 
internal rotation, and external rotation 6 months after surgery. Statistical 
analysis showed that vibration was not a contributing factor at improving these 
parameters in these periods.
CONCLUSION: High-frequency, low-magnitude vibration did provide acute pain 
relief on application 6 weeks after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair surgery. 
However, vibration did not improve tendon-to-bone healing, shoulder range of 
motion, shoulder strength, or shoulder pain with activities, at rest, and at

PURPOSE: The potential benefits of a preoperative femoral nerve block (FNB) in 
hip arthroscopy were explored in a previous retrospective review. The study 
objective was to confirm these findings in a prospective randomized study.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: Fifty patients undergoing hip arthroscopy were included in this 
prospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial that was patient-, 
operator-, and assessor-blinded. Patients received either a preoperative 
ultrasound-guided FNB with 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine (FNB group) or normal 
saline (control group). Nerve blockade was confirmed via standardized sensory 
testing before the induction of general anesthesia. The primary endpoint was 
cumulative consumption of oral morphine equivalent at 24 hours after discharge. 
Secondary endpoints included opioid use at various time points, pain scores,

receiving therapeutic hypothermia (TH) after cardiac arrest. However, incidence 
of mortality and morbidity remains high in this patient group. Rapid targeted 
brain hypothermia induction, together with prompt correction of the underlying 
cause may improve outcomes in these patients. This study investigates the 
efficacy of Rhinochill, an intranasal cooling device over Blanketrol, a surface 
cooling device in inducing TH in cardiac arrest patients within the cardiac 
catheter laboratory.
METHODS: 70 patients were randomized to TH induction with either Rhinochill or 
Blanketrol. Primary outcome measures were time to reach tympanic в‰¤34 В°C from 
randomisation as a surrogate for brain temperature and oesophageal в‰¤34 В°C from 
randomisation as a measurement of core body temperature. Secondary outcomes 
included first hour temperature drop, length of stay in intensive care unit, 
hospital stay, neurological recovery and all-cause mortality at hospital

receiving therapeutic hypothermia (TH) after cardiac arrest. However, incidence 
of mortality and morbidity remains high in this patient group. This study 
investigates the efficacy of Rhinochill, an intranasal cooling device over 
Blanketrol, a surface cooling device in inducing TH in cardiac arrest patients 
within the cardiac catheter laboratory.
METHODS: 70 patients were randomized to TH induction with either Rhinochill or 
Blanketrol. Primary outcome measures were time to reach tympanic ≤34 °C from 
randomisation as a surrogate for brain temperature and oesophageal ≤34 °C from 
randomisation as a measurement of core body temperature. Secondary outcomes 
included first hour temperature drop, length of stay in intensive care unit, 
hospital stay, neurological recovery and all-cause mortality at hospital 
discharge.
RESULTS: There was no difference in time to reach ≤34 °C between Rhinochill and 
Blanketrol (Tympanic ≤34 °C, 75 vs. 107 mins; p=0.101; Oesophageal ≤34 °C, 85

However, there are few well-designed studies comparing approaches to treatment.

Questions/purposes: (1) Which treatment (compression bandaging with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], aspiration, or aspiration with steroid injections) is associated with the highest likelihood of resolution of nonseptic olecranon bursitis? (2) Which treatment is associated with earliest resolution of symptoms? (3) What factors are associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks?

Methods: We enrolled 133 patients from two centers; after applying prespecified exclusions (septic bursitis or concomitant inflammatory arthritis, intraarticular elbow pathology, recent aspiration or steroid injection done elsewhere, and refusal to participate), 90 patients were randomly allocated to receive compression bandaging with NSAIDs (C), aspiration (A), or aspiration with steroid injection (AS) groups (30 patients in each). The groups were similar at baseline in terms of age and gender. Seven patients (four from Group A and three from Group AS) were lost to followup. All patients were followed up weekly for 4 weeks, and the same treatment procedure was repeated if the bursitis recurred with any substantial fluid collection. At 4 weeks, the state of resolution and pain visual analog scale (VAS) were evaluated. Failed resolution was defined as presence of persistent olecranon bursal fluid collection at Week 4 after the initiation of the treatment; on the contrary, if bursal fluid collection was clinically reduced or completely disappeared by the end of Week 4, the treatment was considered successful. We compared the proportion of resolution by Week 4 and the median times to resolution among the treatment groups. In addition, we evaluated whether the resolution affected pain VAS and what factors were associated with the resolution.

Results: There were no differences in the proportion of patients whose bursitis resolved by Week 4 among the three treatment groups (Group C: 25 of 30 [83%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.27-1.72], p = 0.580; Group A: 17 of 26 [65%], relative risk of resolution failure: 2.19 [95% CI, 0.98-4.87], p = 0.083; Group AS: 23 of 27 [85%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.59 [95% CI, 0.22-1.63], p = 0.398) (p = 0.073). Steroid injection after aspiration (Group AS) was associated with the earliest resolution (2.3 weeks [range, 1-4 weeks]) when compared with aspiration alone (Group A; 3.1 weeks [range, 2-4 weeks]) and compression bandaging with NSAIDs (Group C; 3.2 weeks [range, 2-4 weeks]), p = 0.015). Longer duration of symptoms before treatment was the only factor associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks (failed resolution: 6 weeks [range, 2-9 weeks]; successful resolution: 4 weeks [range, 0.4-6 weeks]; p = 0.008).

Conclusions: With the numbers available, there were no differences in efficacy when compression bandaging with NSAIDs, aspiration, and aspiration with steroid injection were compared. However, we were powered only to detect a 30% difference, meaning that if there were a smaller difference in efficacy among the groups, we might not have detected it in a study of this size. Our data can be used as pilot data to power future prospective (and likely multicenter) trials. Because olecranon bursitis can recur, and because treatments like aspiration and aspiration with steroid injection can cause complications, unless future trials demonstrate clear efficacy advantages of aspiration and/or injection both at short and longer terms, we suggest that compression bandaging and a short course of NSAIDs may offer the most appropriate balance of safety and efficacy.",no_spin,7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -0.4637000560760498, 'probability': 0.6289522051811218}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.004875912796705961, 'probability': 0.9951359629631042}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.48553186655044556, 'probability': 0.6153697967529297}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.007280958816409111, 'probability': 0.9927454590797424}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -0.6671716570854187, 'probability': 0.5131579041481018}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.005093574058264494, 'probability': 0.9949193596839905}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.092014193534851, 'probability': 0.33553996682167053}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.006580113898962736, 'probability': 0.9934415221214294}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.5199247598648071, 'probability': 0.5945652723312378}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.003842947306111455, 'probability': 0.9961644411087036}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]"

Our hypothesis was that there would be no differences in joint line angles or correction accuracy between the two groups, that patellar height would increase after CW HTO and decrease after OW HTO, and that leg length and posterior tibial slope would decrease after CW HTO and increase after OW HTO.

Methods: Radiological data were collected from 70 patients participating in an ongoing prospective randomized clinical trial comparing OW and CW HTOs. Digital standing hip-knee-ankle (HKA) radiographs as well as lateral radiographs in 30Ў of flexion were obtained preoperatively and at 6 months for each patient. Joint line angles, HKA angle, leg length, Insall-Salvati index, Miura-Kawamura index and posterior tibial slope were measured using medical planning software. The complete preoperative radiological examinations of the first 50 patients were used in a study of intra- and inter-rater reliability of the measurements.

Results: The mean posterior slope was reduced by 2.5Ў in CW HTO, whereas it remained unchanged in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Mean leg length decreased 5.7 mm in CW HTO and increased 3.1 mm in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Changes in joint line angles, patellar height indexes and the correction accuracy showed no significant differences comparing the two techniques. Frontal plane reliability measurement intra- and inter-rater intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) varied from 0.81 to 0.99. Sagittal plane intra- and inter-rater ICC varied from 0.60 to 0.87. Posterior tibial slope intra- and inter-rater ICC showed the lowest values (0.70 and 0.60, respectively) corresponding to a smallest real difference of 4.5Ў and 5.5Ў, respectively.

Conclusions: Posterior tibial slope and leg length changes were significantly different in CW compared to OW HTOs.

Posterior tibial slope intra- and inter-rater ICC showed the lowest values (0.70 and 0.60, respectively) corresponding to a smallest real difference of 4.5° and 5.5°, respectively.

Objective: To test the hypothesis that high-intensity endurance training (ET) is superior to moderate-intensity ET for improving risk factors for type 2 diabetes in overweight adolescents.

Design and methods: In this randomized trial, 106 overweight and obese adolescents (15.2 years; 76% female; 62% Caucasian) were randomly assigned to high-intensity ET (70-85% of heart rate reserve, n=38), moderate-intensity ET (40-55% heart rate reserve; n=32) or control for 6 months (n=36). The primary and secondary outcome measures were insulin sensitivity assessed using a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test and hepatic triglyceride content with magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Exploratory outcomes were cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity and MRI and dual x-ray absorptiometry-derived measures of adiposity.

Results: The study had 96% retention and attendance was 61±21% and 55±24% in the high- and moderate-intensity ET arms. Intention-to-treat analyses revealed that, at follow-up, insulin sensitivity was not different between high-intensity (-1.0 mU kg(-1) min(-1); 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.6, +1.4 mU kg(-1) min(-1)) and moderate-intensity (+0.26 mU kg(-1) min(-1); 95% CI: -1.3, +1.8 mU kg(-1) min(-1)) ET arms compared with controls (interaction, P=0.97).

Objective: To test the hypothesis that high-intensity endurance training (ET) is superior to moderate-intensity ET for improving risk factors for type 2 diabetes in overweight adolescents.

Design and methods: In this randomized trial, 106 overweight and obese adolescents (15.2 years; 76% female; 62% Caucasian) were randomly assigned to high-intensity ET (70-85% of heart rate reserve, n=38), moderate-intensity ET (40-55% heart rate reserve; n=32) or control for 6 months (n=36). The primary outcome measure was insulin sensitivity assessed using a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. The secondary outcome measure was hepatic triglyceride content with magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Exploratory outcomes were cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity and MRI and dual x-ray absorptiometry-derived measures of adiposity.

Results: The study had 96% retention and attendance was 61±21% and 55±24% in the high- and moderate-intensity ET arms. Intention-to-treat analyses revealed that, at follow-up, insulin sensitivity was not different between high-intensity (-1.0 mU kg(-1) min(-1); 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.6, +1.4 mU kg(-1) min(-1)) and moderate-intensity (+0.26 mU kg(-1) min(-1); 95% CI: -1.3, +1.8 mU kg(-1) min(-1)) ET arms compared with controls (interaction, P=0.97).

patients in the intervention group (nВ = 300) received SPS that included alcohol

This study assessed the effect of a 6-week low-fat (LF) or portion control (PC) diet matched for weight loss on fat taste thresholds, fat perception, and preference in people with overweight/obesity.

Methods: Participants (n = 53) completed a randomized dietary intervention and consumed either a LF diet (25% fat) or PC diet (33% fat) for 6 weeks. Fat taste thresholds (lowest detectable fat concentration), fat perception (discrimination ability), preference, and anthropometry were assessed at baseline and week 6.

Results: Consumption of a LF diet (n = 26) and PC diet (n = 27) reduced participants' weight (P < 0.001), with no significant differences between groups (LF, -2.9%, PC, -2.7%). Both diets resulted in a decrease in fat taste thresholds (P = 0.014), and the effect tended to be stronger in the LF diet vs. the PC diet (P = 0.060).

This study assessed the effect of a 6-week low-fat (LF) or portion control (PC) diet matched for weight loss on fat taste thresholds, fat perception, and preference in people with overweight/obesity.

Methods: Participants (n = 53) completed a randomized dietary intervention and consumed either a LF diet (25% fat) or PC diet (33% fat) for 6 weeks. Fat taste thresholds (lowest detectable fat concentration), fat perception (discrimination ability), preference, and anthropometry were assessed at baseline and week 6.

Results: Consumption of a LF diet (n = 26) and PC diet (n = 27) reduced participants' weight (P < 0.001), with no significant differences between groups (LF, -2.9%, PC, -2.7%). Both diets resulted in a decrease in fat taste thresholds (P = 0.014), with no significant difference between the LF diet and PC diet (P = 0.060).

181,26912284,Conventional En Masse Repair Versus Separate Double-Layer Double-Row Repair for the Treatment of Delaminated Rotator Cuff Tears.,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,,Claim equivalence/non-inferiority versus control for a (-) endpoint,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: The rotator cuff tendon is known to exert a shear force between the 
superficial and deep layers. Owing to this characteristic, separate repair of 
delaminated rotator cuff tears has been introduced for the restoration of the 
physiological biomechanics of the rotator cuff. However, whether conventional en 
masse repair or separate repair is superior is controversial in terms of 
outcomes.
PURPOSE: To compare clinical outcomes between conventional en masse repair and 
separate double-layer double-row repair for the treatment of delaminated rotator 
cuff tears.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled study; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: Between August 2007 and March 2014, a total of 82 patients who 
underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of a delaminated tear were enrolled 
and randomized into 2 groups. In group 1 (n = 48), arthroscopic conventional en 
masse repair was performed. In group 2 (n = 34), separate double-layer 
double-row repair was performed. The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, 
Constant score, Simple Shoulder Test score, visual analog scale (VAS) score 
for pain, and range of motion (ROM) were assessed before surgery; at 3, 6, and 12 
months after surgery; and at the last follow-up visit. Magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) was performed at 12 months postoperatively to examine the retear 
rate and pattern.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference between groups in the preoperative 
demographic data, including patient age, sex, symptom duration, tear size, and 
functional scores (P > .05). The mean follow-up period was 25.9 ± 1.2 months. 
No significant differences in functional scores and ROM were found between the 2 
groups at each time point. Group 2 had significantly lower VAS pain scores (P < 
.05) at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Eight (17%) of 48 patients in group 
1 and 6 (18%) of 34 patients in group 2 showed retears on MRI at 12-month

superficial and deep layers. Owing to this characteristic, separate repair of 
delaminated rotator cuff tears has been introduced for the restoration of the 
physiological biomechanics of the rotator cuff. However, whether conventional en 
masse repair or separate repair is superior is controversial in terms of 
outcomes.
PURPOSE: To compare clinical outcomes between conventional en masse repair and 
separate double-layer double-row repair for the treatment of delaminated rotator 
cuff tears.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled study; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: Between August 2007 and March 2014, a total of 82 patients who 
underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of a delaminated tear were enrolled 
and randomized into 2 groups. In group 1 (n = 48), arthroscopic conventional en 
masse repair was performed. In group 2 (n = 34), separate double-layer 
double-row repair was performed. The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, 
Constant score, Simple Shoulder Test score, and visual analog scale (VAS) score 
for pain and range of motion (ROM) were assessed before surgery; at 3, 6, and 12 
months after surgery; and at the last follow-up visit. Magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) was performed at 12 months postoperatively to examine the retear 
rate and pattern.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference between groups in the preoperative 
demographic data, including patient age, sex, symptom duration, tear size, and 
functional scores (P > .05). The mean follow-up period was 25.9 В± 1.2 months. 
Significant improvements in functional and pain scores were observed in both 
groups at the last follow-up visit. However, no significant differences in 
functional scores and ROM were found between the 2 groups at each time point, 
except that group 2 had significantly lower VAS pain scores (P < .05) at 3, 6, 
and 12 months postoperatively. Eight (17%) of 48 patients in group 1 and 6 (18%) 
of 34 patients in group 2 showed retears on MRI at 12-month follow-up (P > .05).
CONCLUSION: Both conventional en masse repair and separate double-layer 
double-row repair were effective in improving clinical outcomes in the treatment 
of delaminated rotator cuff tears. Lower pain scores were seen in patients who 
underwent separate double-layer double-row repair.",no_spin,7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -0.22775745391845703, 'probability': 0.7963173389434814}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.005333717446774244, 'probability': 0.9946805238723755}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.4457046389579773, 'probability': 0.6403728723526001}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.005107687786221504, 'probability': 0.9949052929878235}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.724259078502655, 'probability': 0.4846835732460022}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0033776871860027313, 'probability': 0.9966279864311218}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.2141400575637817, 'probability': 0.2969653010368347}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.007530516013503075, 'probability': 0.9924977421760559}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.0576540231704712, 'probability': 0.34726956486701965}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.006741398945450783, 'probability': 0.9932813048362732}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]"

METHODS: One hundred twenty patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff 
repair with SLBC lesions (biceps partial tears <50%, partial pulley lesions, and 
type II SLAP lesions) were enrolled in this prospective comparative study and 
randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups (simple debridement [Deb], biceps 
tenotomy only [BTo], or biceps tenodesis with one suture anchor [BTd]). Patients 
with isolated subscapularis tears or osteoarthritis were excluded. Finally, 86

RESULTS: Pain, range of motion, and functional scores improved postoperatively 
in all 3 groups, with no significant differences across groups. At the 6-month 
follow-up, 8 patients reported cramping pain (5 Deb patients, 2 BTo patients,

biceps tendons on the bicipital groove showed low agreement with the presence of 
the Popeye deformity (observed in 13 of 20 patients with the deformity, 65%).

Methods: In this randomized, double-blind trial, we compared parenteral amiodarone, lidocaine, and saline placebo, along with standard care, in adults who had nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia after at least one shock, and vascular access. Paramedics enrolled patients at 10 North American sites. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge; the secondary outcome was favorable neurologic function at discharge. The per-protocol (primary analysis) population included all randomly assigned participants who met eligibility criteria and received any dose of a trial drug and whose initial cardiac-arrest rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia was refractory to shock.

Results: In the per-protocol population, 3026 patients were randomly assigned to amiodarone (974), lidocaine (993), or placebo (1059); of those, 24.4%, 23.7%, and 21.0%, respectively, survived to hospital discharge.

Methods: In this randomized, double-blind trial, we compared parenteral amiodarone, lidocaine, and saline placebo, along with standard care, in adults who had nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia after at least one shock, and vascular access. Paramedics enrolled patients at 10 North American sites. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge; the secondary outcome was favorable neurologic function at discharge. The per-protocol (primary analysis) population included all randomly assigned participants who met eligibility criteria and received any dose of a trial drug and whose initial cardiac-arrest rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia was refractory to shock.

Results: In the per-protocol population, 3026 patients were randomly assigned to amiodarone (974), lidocaine (993), or placebo (1059); of those, 24.4%, 23.7%, and 21.0%, respectively, survived to hospital discharge.

Neurologic outcome at discharge was similar in the three groups. There was heterogeneity of treatment effect with respect to whether the arrest was witnessed (P=0.05); active drugs were associated with a survival rate that was significantly higher than the rate with placebo among patients with bystander-witnessed arrest but not among those with unwitnessed arrest. More amiodarone recipients required temporary cardiac pacing than did recipients of lidocaine or placebo.

100 = best) were 59.8, 64.5, and 64.7 for the low-, medium-, and high-dose 
groups, respectively, and 62.9 for all patients; at 12 months, these were 74.1, 
74.5, and 68.8 for the respective dose groups and 72.4 for all patients. Several 
MOCART items (surface of repair tissue, structure of repair tissue, signal 
intensity of repair tissue, subchondral bone, and synovitis) showed a more rapid 
response with the medium and high doses than with the low dose, suggesting a 
potential dose relationship. No significant correlation between the MOCART 
(overall and subscores) with clinical outcomes as assessed by the overall KOOS 
was detected at 3- and 12-month assessments.
CONCLUSION: This study reveals a trend toward earlier recovery after treatment 
with higher spheroid doses in terms of better defect filling for full-thickness 
cartilage defects of the knee, while outcomes after 12 months were similar in 
all dose groups. However, a correlation with clinical outcomes or the failure 
rate at 1 year after ACI was not found. A longer follow-up will be required for 
more definite conclusions on the clinical relevance of ACI cell density to be 
drawn.

established as a standard treatment for large full-thickness cartilage defects, 
the effect of different doses of autologous chondrocyte products on structural 
outcomes has never been examined.
HYPOTHESIS: In ACI, the dose level may have an influence on medium-term magnetic 
resonance morphological findings after treatment.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: A total of 75 patients who underwent ACI using a pure, autologous, 
third-generation matrix-associated ACI product were divided into 3 groups 
representing different doses: 3 to 7 spheroids/cm(2), 10 to 30 spheroids/cm(2), 
and 40 to 70 spheroids/cm(2). The primary outcome was the magnetic resonance 
observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score at 12 months. Secondary 
outcomes included MOCART scores at 1.5, 3, and 6 months and the Knee injury and 
Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) at all time points.
RESULTS: The mean MOCART scores at 12 months (0 = worst, 100 = best) were 74.1, 
74.5, and 68.8 for the low-, medium-, and high-dose groups, respectively, and 
72.4 for all patients, with no significant difference between dose groups. The 
mean MOCART scores at 3 months were 59.8, 64.5, and 64.7 for the low-, medium-,

groups at earlier time points. No significant correlation between the MOCART 
(overall and subscores) with clinical outcomes as assessed by the overall KOOS

CONCLUSION: Higher spheroid doses were not more effective than lower spheroid 
doses on MOCART scores at 12 months in patients with full-thickness cartilage

This study compared the outcomes of tenotomy with outcomes of tenodesis for treatment of LHBT lesions with rotator cuff tears.

Methods: The study enrolled 128 patients with LHBT lesions and small- to medium-sized rotator cuff tear. Arthroscopic LHBT tenotomy was done in 56 patients (group I), and LHBT tenodesis was done for 72 patients (group II) with rotator cuff repair.

METHODS: From 2009 to 2013, a total of 60 patients with an acute Achilles tendon 
rupture were randomized to surgery or nonsurgical treatment. Nonsurgical 
treatment included first a week of cast immobilization, followed by a functional 
orthosis for 6 weeks, allowing full weightbearing after week 1 and active

the difference varied from 16% to 24% (P = .016), favoring the surgically 
treated group, whereas at 18 months, surgically treated patients had 10% to 18% 
greater strength results (P = .037). At 18 months, a 14% difference in the peak

NВ·m; 95% CI, 2.0-25.1 NВ·m; P = .022). The RAND 36-Item Health Survey indicated 
better results in the domains of physical functioning (P = .006) and bodily pain 
(P = .037) for surgically treated patients.
CONCLUSION: Surgical and nonsurgical treatments of acute Achilles tendon 
ruptures have similar results in terms of the Achilles tendon performance score, 
but surgery restores calf muscle strength earlier over the entire range of 
motion of the ankle joint, with a 10% to 18% strength difference favoring 
surgery at 18 months. Surgery may also result in better health-related quality

between duration of peri-shock pauses in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and 
survival. In a randomized trial, we tested whether shortening these pauses 
improves survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).
METHODS: Patients with OHCA between May 2006 and January 2014 with shockable 
initial rhythm, treated by first responders, were randomized to two automated 
external defibrillator (AED) treatment protocols. In the control protocol AEDs 
performed post-shock analysis and prompted rescuers to a pulse check (Guidelines

was assessed at hospital admission and discharge.
RESULTS: Of 1174 OHCA patients, 456 met the inclusion criteria: 227 were 
randomly assigned to the experimental protocol and 229 to the control protocol. 
The experimental group experienced shorter pre-shock pauses (6 [5-11]s vs. 20

There is still a need for a method of anesthesia that can deliver effective long-term postoperative pain relief without incurring the high cost and health burden of opioids and nerve blocks.

Questions/purposes: (1) Is liposomal bupivacaine-based periarticular injection (PAI) more effective than morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA? (2) Do patients treated with liposomal bupivacaine-based PAI experience fewer opioid-related adverse events compared with patients treated with morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA?

Methods: This multicenter, blind trial randomized 119 patients undergoing TKA with spinal anesthesia to receive spinal anesthesia plus periarticular injection with liposomal bupivacaine (40 patients), spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine plus intrathecal morphine (41 patients) but no liposomal bupivacaine injection, or spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine (38 patients) and no liposomal bupivacaine injection. The two groups that did not receive periarticular liposomal bupivacaine did receive periarticular injection with ropivacaine, and all three groups had ketorolac (30 mg) plus epinephrine (1:1000) in the periarticular injections. Patients in all three groups received identical perioperative multimodal analgesic and antiemetic drugs. All patients were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized and no patients were lost to followup. The primary study endpoints were visual analog score (VAS) for pain and narcotic use during postoperative day 1. Secondary endpoints included side effects associated with narcotic administration during the hospital stay.

Results: Mean VAS pain in the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group was lower than that for the ropivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (1.8 ± 2.1 versus 3.3 ± 2.3, p = 0.005, mean difference: 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-2.5) and 12 hours (1.5 ± 2.0 versus 3.3 ± 2.4, p < 0.001, mean difference: 1.8, 95% CI, 0.8-2.8) after surgery. The morphine spinal group had lower pain compared with the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (0.9 ± 1.8 versus 1.8 ± 2.1, p = 0.035, mean difference: 1.0, 95% CI, 0.1-1.8), but there was no difference at 12 hours (0.8 ± 1.5 versus 1.5 ± 2.0, p = 0.086, mean difference: 0.7, 95% CI, -0.1 to 1.5). The magnitude of the differences at 6 and 12 hours are near the lower end of minimal clinically important differences reported in the literature, and thus the improvement shown in this study may only represent a small clinical improvement. Both the liposomal bupivacaine group (13% [five of 40]) and the ropivacaine group (5% [two of 38]) had fewer incidents of itching (pruritus) than the spinal morphine group (38% [15 of 41]) (p = 0.001).

reconstruction (ACLR) have been of autografts or nonirradiated allografts with a 
single-bundle (SB) technique. Outcome reports evaluating anatomic double-bundle 
(DB) ACLR with a hamstring tendon autograft versus irradiated allograft are 
rare.
PURPOSE: To compare the clinical outcomes of arthroscopic anatomic DB ACLR with 
a hamstring tendon autograft versus irradiated allograft.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: Between 2008 and 2009, a total of 107 patients undergoing arthroscopic 
DB ACLR were prospectively randomized consecutively into 1 of 2 groups 
(autograft [Auto] group and irradiated allograft [Ir-Allo] group). All the 
surgical procedures were performed by the same senior surgeon using the DB 
reconstruction technique. All irradiated hamstring tendon allografts were 
sterilized with 2.5 Mrad of irradiation before distribution and were obtained 
from a single certified tissue bank. Graft fixation on the femoral side was by 
an Endobutton, and on the tibial side by a bioabsorbable interference screw 
augmented with a staple. The same rehabilitation protocol was applied to all 
patients. Before surgery and at a mean of 6.9 years of follow-up, patients were 
evaluated by the same observer according to objective and subjective clinical 
evaluations including detailed history, physical examination, radiography,

reconstruction (ACLR) have been of autografts or nonirradiated allografts with a 
single-bundle (SB) technique. Outcome reports evaluating anatomic double-bundle 
(DB) ACLR with a hamstring tendon autograft versus irradiated allograft are 
rare.
PURPOSE: To compare the clinical outcomes of arthroscopic anatomic DB ACLR with 
a hamstring tendon autograft versus irradiated allograft.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: Between 2008 and 2009, a total of 107 patients undergoing arthroscopic 
DB ACLR were prospectively randomized consecutively into 1 of 2 groups 
(autograft [Auto] group and irradiated allograft [Ir-Allo] group). All the 
surgical procedures were performed by the same senior surgeon using the DB 
reconstruction technique. All irradiated hamstring tendon allografts were 
sterilized with 2.5 Mrad of irradiation before distribution and were obtained 
from a single certified tissue bank. Graft fixation on the femoral side was by 
an Endobutton, and on the tibial side by a bioabsorbable interference screw 
augmented with a staple. The same rehabilitation protocol was applied to all 
patients. Before surgery and at a mean of 6.9 years of follow-up, patients were 
evaluated by the same observer according to objective and subjective clinical 
evaluations including detailed history, physical examination, radiography, 
functional knee ligament testing, KT-2000 arthrometer testing, Harner vertical 
jump and Daniel 1-legged hop tests, Lysholm score, Tegner score, International 
Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) standard evaluation form, and Cincinnati 
knee score.
RESULTS: A total of 83 patients (Auto: n = 40 [mean age, 29.2 В± 6.9 years]; 
Ir-Allo: n = 43 [mean age, 28.6 В± 7.2 years]) fulfilled follow-up and clinical 
evaluations. No significant differences were found between the 2 groups 
according to the overall IKDC functional and subjective evaluations as well as 
testing of activity levels. Significant between-group differences were found 
when comparing the results at final follow-up according to the Lachman test, 
anterior drawer test, pivot-shift test, and KT-2000 arthrometer measurements (P 
< .001). Most importantly, 87.5% of patients in the Auto group and 34.9% in the 
Ir-Allo group had a side-to-side difference <3 mm. The rate of laxity 
(side-to-side difference >5 mm) with an irradiated allograft (30.2%) was higher 
than that with an autograft (7.5%) (P < .001). The failure rate in the Ir-Allo 
group (30.2%) was higher than that in the Auto group (7.5%) (P < .001). Anterior 
and rotational stability decreased significantly in the Ir-Allo group; patients 
in the Ir-Allo group also had a shorter operation time. There were 10.0% (4/40) 
of patients in the Auto group and 32.6% (19/43) of patients in the Ir-Allo group 
who had arthritic progression (P < .05).
CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences in postoperative activity 
levels and functional outcomes between the Auto and Ir-Allo groups. However, a

groin pain and diminished functional outcome after THA. So far, estimation by 
eye and palpation is the standard procedure to intraoperatively assess the 
distance of the cup to the anterior rim. However, novel technologies such as 
imageless navigation enable intraoperative measurements of the cup in relation 
to the psoas tendon and bony landmarks.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether psoas impingement can be reduced using 
imageless navigation compared with the standard technique.
METHODS: The current study is a reanalysis of data from a randomized controlled 
trial evaluating navigation for THA; 135 patients were randomized for surgery 
with or without the use of imageless navigation. The primary outcome was the 
risk for anterior protrusion of the cup above the acetabular rim and thus 
potential psoas impingement, defined as an overhang of the cup above the 
anterior acetabular rim as measured on postoperative CT, which was either 
controlled with the help of navigation or standard control by eye and palpation 
intraoperatively. Postoperatively, the anterior protrusion of the cup above the 
acetabular rim was measured on three-dimensional (3-D) CT by a blinded, external 
institute. In addition to patient-related outcome measures, the Harris hip 
score, Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and EuroQol were 
obtained 1 year postoperatively. Altogether 123 data sets were available for 
primary analysis and 115 were available for 1-year followup.
RESULTS: There was no difference, with the numbers available, between the 
navigated and the control groups in terms of the mean distance of the cup below 
the anterosuperior acetabular rim (3.9 mm; -5.3 to 12.6 mm versus 4.4 mm; -7.9 
to 13.7 mm; p = 0.72) or the anteroinferior acetabular rim (4.7 mm; -6.2 to 14.8 
mm versus 4.2 mm; -7.1 to 16.3 mm; p = 0.29). There was no difference, with the 
numbers available, in terms of the proportion of cups with anterior overhang 
(7%, four of 57 versus, 15%, 10 of 66; p = 0.16), respectively. After 
controlling for potential confounding variables such as cup inclination, cup 
size, patient age, BMI, stage of arthritis, and length of skin incision, we 
found cup anteversion (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% CI, 0.81-0.93; p < 0.001) 
and female sex (HR, 3.88; 95% CI, 1.01-14.93; p = 0.049) were associated with a 
propensity to potential psoas impingement. With the numbers available, there 
were no differences observed in clinical scores between groups with and without 
anterior cup protrusion.

and palpation in preventing potential psoas impingement in patients undergoing

groin pain and diminished functional outcome after THA. So far, estimation by 
eye and palpation is the standard procedure to intraoperatively assess the 
distance of the cup to the anterior rim. However, novel technologies such as 
imageless navigation enable intraoperative measurements of the cup in relation 
to the psoas tendon and bony landmarks.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether psoas impingement (1) can be reduced using 
imageless navigation compared with the standard technique and (2) is associated 
with specific patient characteristics. Furthermore, we investigated (3) if 
anterior cup protrusion (overhang) is associated with lower outcome scores for 
pain and function.
METHODS: The current study is a reanalysis of data from a randomized controlled 
trial evaluating navigation for THA; 135 patients were randomized for surgery 
with or without the use of imageless navigation. The risk for anterior 
protrusion of the cup above the acetabular rim and thus potential psoas 
impingement, defined as an overhang of the cup above the anterior acetabular rim 
as measured on postoperative CT, was either controlled with the help of 
navigation or standard control by eye and palpation intraoperatively. 
Postoperatively, the anterior protrusion of the cup above the acetabular rim was 
measured on three-dimensional (3-D) CT by a blinded, external institute. In 
addition to patient-related outcome measures, the Harris hip score, Hip 
disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and EuroQol were obtained 1 year 
postoperatively. Altogether 123 data sets were available for primary analysis 
and 115 were available for 1-year followup.
RESULTS: There was no difference, with the numbers available, between the 
navigated and the control groups in terms of the mean distance of the cup below 
the anterosuperior acetabular rim (3.9 mm; -5.3 to 12.6 mm versus 4.4 mm; -7.9 
to 13.7 mm; p = 0.72) or the anteroinferior acetabular rim (4.7 mm; -6.2 to 14.8 
mm versus 4.2 mm; -7.1 to 16.3 mm; p = 0.29). There was no difference, with the 
numbers available, in terms of the proportion of cups with anterior overhang 
(7%, four of 57 versus, 15%, 10 of 66; p = 0.16), respectively. After 
controlling for potential confounding variables such as cup inclination, cup 
size, patient age, BMI, stage of arthritis, and length of skin incision, we 
found cup anteversion (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% CI, 0.81-0.93; p < 0.001) 
and female sex (HR, 3.88; 95% CI, 1.01-14.93; p = 0.049) were associated with a 
propensity to potential psoas impingement. With the numbers available, there 
were no differences observed in clinical scores between groups with and without 
anterior cup protrusion.
CONCLUSIONS: We found no differences between imageless navigation and estimation 
by eye and palpation in preventing potential psoas impingement. Despite the 
comparable clinical outcome for patients with and without cup protrusion, the 
orthopaedic surgeon should be especially aware of propensity for psoas 
impingement in women.",no_spin,5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -0.8345550298690796, 'probability': 0.43406757712364197}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.007080226205289364, 'probability': 0.9929447174072266}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.4743637442588806, 'probability': 0.6222808361053467}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.007312319707125425, 'probability': 0.9927143454551697}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -0.7478007078170776, 'probability': 0.473406583070755}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.005032965913414955, 'probability': 0.9949796199798584}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -1.3813555240631104, 'probability': 0.25123775005340576}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0043165371753275394, 'probability': 0.9956928491592407}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.1266558170318604, 'probability': 0.3241153359413147}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.006237326189875603, 'probability': 0.9937820434570312}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]"

Methods: Forty-two consecutive patients scheduled for hip arthroscopy were randomized into 2 postoperative pain control groups. One group received preemptive intra-articular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection, and the second group received preemptive periacetabular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection. Before closure all patients received an additional dose of 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% intra-articularly. Data were compared with respect to postoperative pain with visual analog scale (VAS) and analgesic consumption, documented in a pain diary for 2 weeks after surgery.

Results: Twenty-one patients were treated with intra-articular injection, and 21 patients with peri-acetabular injection. There were no significant differences with regards to patient demographics or surgical procedures. VAS scores recorded during the first 30 minutes postoperatively and 18 hours after surgery were significantly lower in the periacetabular group compared with in the intra-articular group (0.667 ± 1.49 vs 2.11 ± 2.29; P < .045 and 2.62 ± 2.2 vs 4.79 ± 2.6; P < .009).

We randomized a convenience sample of adult patients with acute peripheral

their initial level (t0) of vertigo on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) and

their initial level (t0) of vertigo on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) and 
after 30В min (t30) and 60В min (t60). The primary outcome parameter was the mean 
change in VAS score from t0 to t60. Differences between groups and 95% 
confidence intervals were calculated. Our a priori power calculation estimated 
that a sample size of 20 patients in each group was required to have an 80% 
power to detect a difference of 20В mm between treatment groups.
RESULTS: There were 20 patients in the diazepam group and 20 in the meclizine 
group. The two groups were similar with respect to patient demographics and 
presenting signs and symptoms. At t60, the mean improvements in the diazepam and 
meclizine groups were 36 and 40, respectively (difference -4; 95% confidence 
interval -20 to 12; pВ =В 0.60).
CONCLUSION: We found no difference between oral diazepam and oral meclizine for 
the treatment of ED patients with acute peripheral vertigo.",no_spin,5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -0.04405437409877777, 'probability': 0.9569019079208374}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0032928551081568003, 'probability': 0.9967125654220581}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.35987868905067444, 'probability': 0.6977609395980835}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.004904146306216717, 'probability': 0.9951078295707703}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -0.6080862283706665, 'probability': 0.5443916916847229}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0029306341893970966, 'probability': 0.9970736503601074}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.2667315006256104, 'probability': 0.28175103664398193}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.009263982996344566, 'probability': 0.9907787442207336}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.8287143111228943, 'probability': 0.43661028146743774}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0068828873336315155, 'probability': 0.9931407570838928}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]"

Design: A randomised controlled trial of 503 participants followed for six months.

Setting: Participants were recruited from two tertiary acute care settings in Kingston, ON, Canada.

Participants: The broad inclusion criteria were patients aged і16 presenting for acute medical assessment and treatment of a simple grade 1 or 2 ankle sprain. Exclusions were patients with multiple injuries, other conditions limiting mobility, and ankle injuries that required immobilisation and those unable to accommodate the time intensive study protocol.

Intervention: Participants received either usual care, consisting of written instructions regarding protection, rest, cryotherapy, compression, elevation, and graduated weight bearing activities, or usual care enhanced with a supervised programme of physiotherapy.

Main outcome measures: The primary outcome of efficacy was the proportion of participants reporting excellent recovery assessed with the foot and ankle outcome score (FAOS). Excellent recovery was defined as a score і450/500 at three months. A difference of at least 15% increase in the absolute proportion of participants with excellent recovery was deemed clinically important. Secondary analyses included the assessment of excellent recovery at one and six months; change from baseline using continuous scores at one, three, and six months; and clinical and biomechanical measures of ankle function, assessed at one, three, and six months.

Results: The absolute proportion of patients achieving excellent recovery at three months was not significantly different between the physiotherapy (98/229, 43%) and usual care (79/214, 37%) arms (absolute difference 6%, 95% confidence interval -3% to 15%).

Design: A randomised controlled trial of 503 participants followed for six months.

Setting: Participants were recruited from two tertiary acute care settings in Kingston, ON, Canada.

Participants: The broad inclusion criteria were patients aged і16 presenting for acute medical assessment and treatment of a simple grade 1 or 2 ankle sprain. Exclusions were patients with multiple injuries, other conditions limiting mobility, and ankle injuries that required immobilisation and those unable to accommodate the time intensive study protocol.

Intervention: Participants received either usual care, consisting of written instructions regarding protection, rest, cryotherapy, compression, elevation, and graduated weight bearing activities, or usual care enhanced with a supervised programme of physiotherapy.

Main outcome measures: The primary outcome of efficacy was the proportion of participants reporting excellent recovery assessed with the foot and ankle outcome score (FAOS). Excellent recovery was defined as a score і450/500 at three months. A difference of at least 15% increase in the absolute proportion of participants with excellent recovery was deemed clinically important. Secondary analyses included the assessment of excellent recovery at one and six months; change from baseline using continuous scores at one, three, and six months; and clinical and biomechanical measures of ankle function, assessed at one, three, and six months.

Results: The absolute proportion of patients achieving excellent recovery at three months was not significantly different between the physiotherapy (98/229, 43%) and usual care (79/214, 37%) arms (absolute difference 6%, 95% confidence interval -3% to 15%).

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of intranasal (IN) ketamine versus 
intravenous (IV) morphine in reducing pain in patients with renal colic.
METHODS: A randomized double-blind controlled trial was performed in 53 patients 
with renal colic recruited from the emergency department (ED) in 2015. Finally, 
40 patients were enrolled in this study. Patients in the ketamine group received 
IN ketamine 1 mg/kg and IV placebo while patients in the control group received 
IV morphine 0.1mg/kg and IN placebo. Our goal was to assess visual analogue 
scale (VAS) changes between the 2 groups. Patients' VAS scores were reported

with renal colic. Ketamine is a popular choice as an analgesic.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of intranasal (IN) ketamine versus 
intravenous (IV) morphine in reducing pain in patients with renal colic.
METHODS: A randomized double-blind controlled trial was performed in 53 patients 
with renal colic recruited from the emergency department (ED) in 2015. Finally, 
40 patients were enrolled in this study. Patients in the ketamine group received 
IN ketamine 1 mg/kg and IV placebo while patients in the control group received 
IV morphine 0.1mg/kg and IN placebo. The primary outcome was to assess visual analogue 
scale (VAS) changes between the 2 groups. Patients' VAS scores were reported 
before and 5, 15, 30min after drug injection.
RESULTS: Before drug administration, the mean±SD VAS score was 7.40±1.18 in the 
morphine group (group A) and 8.35±1.30 in the ketamine group (group B) 
(P-value=0.021). After adjustment by the appropriate analysis, the mean±SD VAS 
score in group (A) and (B) at 5min were (6.07±0.47 vs 6.87±0.47; mean difference

Methods: We conducted a single-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. One hundred one patients were randomized to receive either TXA or an equivalent volume of normal saline. The primary outcome measure was thigh swelling. Secondary outcome measures included, visual analogue pain score, timed up and go test, a 10 meter walk test, and length of stay. Blood loss and the incidence of blood transfusions were also recorded.

Results: There were no statistically significant differences between the primary outcome of thigh swelling or the secondary outcome measures of postoperative pain nor mobility. There was a significant reduction in length of stay for those that received TXA 3.58 days (0.84) compared with the control group 4.27 days (0.98) (P < .001).

PURPOSE: To compare the long-term results of patellar instability after TTT with

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: A total of 34 patients (36 knees) were randomized to 2 groups. The 
first group underwent lateral release (LR) and TTT for confirmed maltracking of 
the patella (control group). The second group underwent MPFL reconstruction in 
addition to TTT and LR (reconstruction group). The primary outcomes were 
validated questionnaires (Kujala score, Tegner activity score) and a visual 
analog scale (VAS) assessing their insecurity. Secondary outcomes included 
clinical assessment, redislocation rates, reoperation rates, time to return to 
activities, patient satisfaction, and quantitative computed tomography (CT) at 1

PURPOSE: To compare the clinical and anatomic outcomes of the interference screw

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: A total of 80 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair 
with SLBC lesions were prospectively enrolled and randomly divided according to 
the tenodesis method: the IS and SA groups. The primary outcome was the anatomic 
status of tenodesis estimated using magnetic resonance imaging or

joint precede radiographic abnormalities of posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) 
by as much as decades. A growing body of evidence strongly suggests that the 
progression from anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury to PTOA is 
multifactorial, involving the interplay between biomechanical disturbances and 
biochemical homeostasis of articular cartilage.
PURPOSE: The purposes of this randomized study using an acute ACL injury model 
were to (1) evaluate the natural progression of inflammatory and 
chondrodegenerative biomarkers, (2) evaluate the relationship between subjective 
reports of pain and inflammatory and chondrodegenerative biomarkers, and (3) 
determine if postinjury arthrocentesis and corticosteroid injection offer the 
ability to alter this biochemical cascade.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: A total of 49 patients were randomized to 4 groups: group 1 
(corticosteroid at 4 days after ACL injury, placebo injection of saline at 2 
weeks), group 2 (placebo at 4 days after ACL injury, corticosteroid at 2 weeks), 
group 3 (corticosteroid at both time intervals), or a placebo group (saline 
injections at both time intervals). Patient-reported outcome measures and 
synovial biomarkers were collected at approximately 4 days, 11 days, and 5 weeks 
after injury. The change between the time points was assessed for all variables 
using Wilcoxon tests, and the relationship between changes in outcome scores and 
biomarkers were assessed by calculating Spearman ПЃ. Outcomes and biomarkers were 
also compared between the 4 groups using Kruskal-Wallis tests.
RESULTS: No adverse events or infections were observed in any study patients. 
With the exception of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) and tumor necrosis 
factor-inducible gene 6 (TSG-6), chondrodegenerative markers worsened over the 
first 5 weeks while all patient-reported outcomes improved during this time, 
regardless of treatment group. Patient-reported outcomes did not differ between 
patients receiving corticosteroid injections and the placebo group. However, 
increases in C-telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II), associated with 
collagen type II breakdown, were significantly greater in the placebo group 
(1.32 В± 1.10 ng/mL) than in either of the groups that received the 
corticosteroid injection within the first several days after injury (group 1: 
0.23 В± 0.27 ng/mL [ P = .01]; group 3: 0.19 В± 0.34 ng/mL [ P = .01]).
CONCLUSION: PTOA begins at the time of injury and results early on in dramatic 
matrix changes in the knee. However, it is encouraging that early intervention 
with an anti-inflammatory agent was able to affect biomarkers of chondral 
degeneration. Should early intervention lead to meaningful changes in either the 
onset or severity of symptomatic PTOA, the current treatment paradigm for 
patients with ACL injury may have to be restructured to include early aspiration 
and intra-articular intervention.",no_spin,7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -0.6578119993209839, 'probability': 0.5179833769798279}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.004516875371336937, 'probability': 0.9954934120178223}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.3759240508079529, 'probability': 0.6866544485092163}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00522580835968256, 'probability': 0.9947877526283264}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.5155394077301025, 'probability': 0.5971783995628357}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.003917164634913206, 'probability': 0.9960904717445374}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.28165864944458, 'probability': 0.2775765061378479}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.007596297189593315, 'probability': 0.9924325346946716}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.560100257396698, 'probability': 0.571151852607727}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.003986983094364405, 'probability': 0.9960209131240845}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]"

treatment focuses on management of respiratory distress and hypoxia. High-flow 
warm humidified oxygen (HFWHO) is increasingly used, but has not been rigorously 
studied in randomised trials. We aimed to examine whether HFWHO provided 
enhanced respiratory support, thereby shortening time to weaning off oxygen.
METHODS: In this open, phase 4, randomised controlled trial, we recruited 
children aged less than 24 months with moderate bronchiolitis attending the 
emergency department of the John Hunter Hospital or the medical unit of the John 
Hunter Children's Hospital in New South Wales, Australia. Patients were randomly 
allocated (1:1) via opaque sealed envelopes to HFWHO (maximum flow of 1 L/kg per 
min to a limit of 20 L/min using 1:1 air-oxygen ratio, resulting in a maximum 
FiO2 of 0В·6) or standard therapy (cold wall oxygen 100% via infant nasal 
cannulae at low flow to a maximum of 2 L/min) using a block size of four and 
stratifying for gestational age at birth. The primary outcome was time from 
randomisation to last use of oxygen therapy. All randomised children were 
included in the primary and secondary safety analyses. This trial is registered 
with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number 
ACTRN12612000685819.
FINDINGS: From July 16, 2012, to May 1, 2015, we randomly assigned 202 children 
to either HFWHO (101 children) or standard therapy (101 children). Median time 
to weaning was 24 h (95% CI 18-28) for standard therapy and 20 h (95% CI 17-34) 
for HFWHO (hazard ratio [HR] for difference in survival distributions 0В·9 [95% 
CI 0В·7-1В·2]; log rank p=0В·61). Fewer children experienced treatment failure on 
HFWHO (14 [14%]) compared with standard therapy (33 [33%]; p=0В·0016); of these 
children, those on HFWHO were supported for longer than were those on standard 
therapy before treatment failure (HR 0В·3; 95% CI 0В·2-0В·6; p<0В·0001). 20 (61%) of 
33 children who experienced treatment failure on standard therapy were rescued 
with HFWHO. 12 (12%) of children on standard therapy required transfer to the 
intensive care unit compared with 14 (14%) of those on HFWHO (difference -1%; 
95% CI -7 to 16; p=0В·41). Four adverse events occurred (oxygen desaturation and 
condensation inhalation in the HFWHO group, and two incidences of oxygen tubing 
disconnection in the standard therapy group); none resulted in withdrawal from 
the trial. No oxygen-related serious adverse events occurred. Secondary 
effectiveness outcomes are reported in the Results section.
INTERPRETATION: HFWHO did not significantly reduce time on oxygen compared with 
standard therapy, suggesting that early use of HFWHO does not modify the 
underlying disease process in moderately severe bronchiolitis. HFWHO might have 
a role as a rescue therapy to reduce the proportion of children requiring

out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Regionalisation of care into cardiac 
arrest centres (CAC) may improve this. We report a pilot randomised trial of 
expedited transfer to a CAC following OHCA without ST-elevation. The objective 
was to assess the feasibility of performing a large-scale randomised controlled 
trial.
METHODS: Adult witnessed ventricular fibrillation OHCA of presumed cardiac cause 
were randomised 1:1 to either: (1) treatment: comprising expedited transfer to a 
CAC for goal-directed therapy including access to immediate reperfusion, or (2) 
control: comprising current standard of care involving delivery to the 
geographically closest hospital. The feasibility of randomisation, protocol 
adherence and data collection of the primary (30-day all-cause mortality) and 
secondary (cerebral performance category (CPC)) and in-hospital major 
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) clinical outcome measures were 
assessed.
RESULTS: Between November 2014 and April 2016, 118 cases were screened, of which 
63 patients (53%) met eligibility criteria and 40 of the 63 patients (63%) were

168,28282221,Collagen Augmentation Improves the Quality of Cartilage Repair After Microfracture in Patients Undergoing High Tibial Osteotomy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,  Focus on (+) secondary endpoint,Claim benefit based on (+) secondary endpoint,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: The quality of cartilage repair after marrow stimulation is 
unpredictable. To overcome the shortcomings of the microfracture technique, 
various augmentation techniques have been developed. However, their efficacies 
remain unclear.
HYPOTHESIS: The quality of cartilage repair and clinical outcomes would be 
superior in patients undergoing high tibial osteotomy (HTO) with microfracture 
and collagen augmentation compared to those undergoing HTO with microfracture 
alone without collagen augmentation for the treatment of medial compartment 
osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.
METHODS: Twenty-eight patients undergoing HTO were randomized into 2 groups: 
microfracture alone (group 1, n = 14) or microfracture with collagen 
augmentation (group 2, n = 14). At 1 year postoperatively, second-look 
arthroscopic surgery and biopsy of repaired cartilage were performed at the time 
of HTO plate removal. Biopsy specimens were graded using the International 
Cartilage Repair Society Visual Assessment Scale II (ICRS II). In addition, 
imaging outcomes in terms of the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage 
repair tissue (MOCART) score were assessed based on magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI). Finally, clinical outcomes in terms of the visual analog scale (VAS) for 
pain score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International 
Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and Tegner activity scale score were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: The mean ICRS II score in group 2 was significantly higher than that in 
group 1 (1053.2 vs 885.4, respectively; P = .002). Group 2 showed greater 
improvement in tissue morphology, cell morphology, surface architecture, 
middle/deep zone assessment, and overall assessment compared with group 1 ( P < 
.050 for all comparisons). Imaging outcomes based on the MOCART score were 
superior in group 2 compared to those in group 1 on MRI at 1 year 
postoperatively (64.6 vs 45.4, respectively; P = .001). The degree of defect 
repair was better in group 2 than in group 1 ( P = .040). Clinical outcomes in 
terms of the VAS for pain score, KOOS, IKDC score, and Tegner activity scale 
score were improved in both groups without between-group differences ( P > .100 
for all comparisons).
CONCLUSION: The quality of cartilage repair after microfracture with collagen 
augmentation was superior to that after microfracture alone in patients

unpredictable. To overcome the shortcomings of the microfracture technique, 
various augmentation techniques have been developed. However, their efficacies 
remain unclear.
HYPOTHESIS: The quality of cartilage repair and clinical outcomes would be 
superior in patients undergoing high tibial osteotomy (HTO) with microfracture 
and collagen augmentation compared to those undergoing HTO with microfracture 
alone without collagen augmentation for the treatment of medial compartment 
osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.
METHODS: Twenty-eight patients undergoing HTO were randomized into 2 groups: 
microfracture alone (group 1, n = 14) or microfracture with collagen 
augmentation (group 2, n = 14). At 1 year postoperatively, second-look 
arthroscopic surgery and biopsy of repaired cartilage were performed at the time 
of HTO plate removal. Biopsy specimens were graded using the International 
Cartilage Repair Society Visual Assessment Scale II (ICRS II). In addition, 
imaging outcomes in terms of the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage 
repair tissue (MOCART) score were assessed based on magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI). Clinical outcomes in terms of the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain 
score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International Knee 
Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and Tegner activity scale score were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: The mean ICRS II score in group 2 was significantly higher than that in 
group 1 (1053.2 vs 885.4, respectively; P = .002). Group 2 showed greater 
improvement in tissue morphology, cell morphology, surface architecture, 
middle/deep zone assessment, and overall assessment compared with group 1 ( P < 
.050 for all comparisons). Imaging outcomes based on the MOCART score were 
superior in group 2 compared to those in group 1 on MRI at 1 year 
postoperatively (64.6 vs 45.4, respectively; P = .001). The degree of defect 
repair was better in group 2 than in group 1 ( P = .040). Clinical outcomes in 
terms of the VAS for pain score, KOOS, IKDC score, and Tegner activity scale 
score showed no significant between-group differences ( P > .100 for all 
comparisons).
CONCLUSION: Microfracture with collagen augmentation was not more effective on 
clinical outcomes than microfracture alone in patients undergoing HTO for medial 
compartment osteoarthritis of the knee.",spin,4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.8440425395965576, 'probability': 0.42996886372566223}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00769933732226491, 'probability': 0.9923301935195923}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.7330804467201233, 'probability': 0.48042675852775574}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00518121849745512, 'probability': 0.9948321580886841}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.1285293102264404, 'probability': 0.32350867986679077}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00592843210324645, 'probability': 0.9940891265869141}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.3021140098571777, 'probability': 0.27195626497268677}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.015413216315209866, 'probability': 0.9847049713134766}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -1.1962945461273193, 'probability': 0.30231234431266785}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.005906982813030481, 'probability': 0.9941104054450989}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]"

Biological analysis of PRP has demonstrated an anti-inflammatory effect on the intra-articular environment.

Purpose: To compare the clinical and biological effects of an intra-articular injection of PRP with those of an intra-articular injection of HA in patients with mild to moderate knee OA.

Study design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods: A total of 111 patients with symptomatic unilateral knee OA received a series of either leukocyte-poor PRP or HA injections under ultrasound guidance. Clinical data were collected before treatment and at 4 time points across a 1-year period. Synovial fluid was also collected for analysis of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers before treatment and at 12 and 24 weeks after treatment. Several measures were used to assess results: (1) Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale; (2) International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee evaluation, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, and Lysholm knee score; and (3) difference in intra-articular biochemical marker concentrations.

Results: There were 49 patients randomized to treatment with PRP and 50 randomized to treatment with HA. No difference was seen between the groups in the primary outcome measure (WOMAC pain score). In the secondary outcome measure, linear contrasts identified a significantly higher IKDC score in the PRP group compared with the HA group at 24 weeks (mean ± standard error [SE], 65.5 ± 3.6 vs 55.8 ± 3.8, respectively; P = .013) and at final follow-up (52 weeks) (57.6 ± 3.37 vs 46.6 ± 3.76, respectively; P = .003). Linear contrasts also identified a statistically lower VAS score in the PRP group versus the HA group at 24 weeks (mean ± SE, 34.6 ± 3.24 vs 48.6 ± 3.7, respectively; P = .0096) and 52 weeks (44 ± 4.6 vs 57.3 ± 3.8, respectively; P = .0039). An examination of fixed effects showed that patients with mild OA and a lower body mass index had a statistically significant improvement in outcomes. In the biochemical analysis, differences between groups approached significance for interleukin-1_ (mean ± SE, 0.14 ± 0.05 pg/mL [PRP] vs 0.34 ± 0.16 pg/mL [HA]; P = .06) and tumor necrosis factor _ (0.08 ± 0.01 pg/mL [PRP] vs 0.2 ± 0.18 pg/mL [HA]; P = .068) at 12-week follow-up.

Conclusion: We found no difference between HA and PRP at any time point in the primary outcome measure: the patient-reported WOMAC pain score. Significant improvements were seen in other patient-reported outcome measures, with results favoring PRP over HA.

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) seems to achieve equal weight loss as laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), but there is still much debate about the quality of life (QOL) after LSG, mainly concerning the association with gastroesophageal reflux. Our hypothesis is that QOL after LSG is comparable with QOL after LRYGB.

Materials and methods: Between February 2013 and February 2014, 150 patients were randomized to undergo either LSG or LRYGB in our clinic. Differences in QOL were compared between groups by using multiple QOL questionnaires at follow-up moments preoperatively and 2 and 12 months after surgery.

Results: After 12 months of follow-up, 128 patients had returned the questionnaires. Most QOL questionnaires showed significant improvement in scores between the preoperative moment and after 12 months of follow-up. The Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Questionnaire (GerdQ) score deteriorated in the LSG group after 2 months, but recovered again after 12 months. After 2 months of follow-up, the mean GerdQ score was 6.95 ± 2.14 in the LSG group versus 5.50 ± 1.49 in the LRYGB group (p < 0.001).

to report concise 10-year follow-up results.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the 71 patients in the previous randomized 
clinical trial, comparing clinical outcomes, revisions, reoperations, and 
implant survivorship between the 2-incision and the mini-posterior THAs.
RESULTS: At the most recent follow-up, the mean Harris hip score was 85 in the 
2-incision group and 87 in the mini-posterior group (PВ = .4). There were 4 
revisions and 2 reoperations (16%) in the 2-incision group vs 1 revision and 3 
reoperations (11%) in the mini-posterior group (PВ = .5). Ten-year survivorship 
free of aseptic revision or reoperation was 77% in the 2-incision group vs 90% 
in the mini-posterior group (PВ =В .15).
CONCLUSION: There were no improvements in early or midterm clinical outcomes 
with the 2-incision technique. However, there was a clinical trend toward a 
higher rate of aseptic revisions in the 2-incision THA group.",no_spin,4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.35730454325675964, 'probability': 0.6995593905448914}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0054686469957232475, 'probability': 0.9945462346076965}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.5587249398231506, 'probability': 0.5719378590583801}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.003244138788431883, 'probability': 0.9967610836029053}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.6164084672927856, 'probability': 0.5398799777030945}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.004360690712928772, 'probability': 0.9956488013267517}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.204252004623413, 'probability': 0.29991626739501953}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.005833268631249666, 'probability': 0.9941837191581726}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -1.1454508304595947, 'probability': 0.31808048486709595}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0039043400902301073, 'probability': 0.9961033463478088}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]"

Methods: Sixty morbid obese patients (BMI і 35) were evaluated before and after 12 weeks of bariatric surgery in order to compare the impact of two different exercise programs on body composition and functional capacity outcomes. Participants were divided into three groups: aerobic (A), aerobic-strength (AS), and control (C) group. Aerobic capacity was assessed with 12-min walk-run test (12MWRT). One-repetition maximum (1RM) test was performed to evaluation upper limb muscle strength. Lower extremity functional capacity was assessed by sit-to-stand test.

Results: Weight, percent body fat (PBF), and fat mass (FM) reduced greater in the trial groups in comparison to the C group (P < 0.05). In the AS group, the reduction of fat-free mass (FFM) was significantly lower than that in the other groups. Mean changes in 12MWRT increased significantly in the intervention groups. The mean change in the sit-to-stand scores was not statistically significant between the three groups. Comparing the intervention groups showed that mean changes in 1RM variables increased in AS group (P = 0.03).

regimens possessing in vitro MRSA activity provide improved outcomes compared 
with treatments lacking MRSA activity.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 
yields a higher clinical cure rate of uncomplicated cellulitis than cephalexin 
alone.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized 
superiority trial in 5 US emergency departments among outpatients older than 12 
years with cellulitis and no wound, purulent drainage, or abscess enrolled from 
April 2009 through June 2012. All participants had soft tissue ultrasound 
performed at the time of enrollment to exclude abscess. Final follow-up was 
August 2012.
INTERVENTIONS: Cephalexin, 500 mg 4 times daily, plus 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily, for 7 days (nвЂ‰=вЂ‰248 
participants) or cephalexin plus placebo for 7 days (nвЂ‰=вЂ‰248 participants).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome determined a priori in the 
per-protocol group was clinical cure, defined as absence of these clinical 
failure criteria at follow-up visits: fever; increase in erythema (>25%), 
swelling, or tenderness (days 3-4); no decrease in erythema, swelling, or 
tenderness (days 8-10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness 
(days 14-21). A clinically significant difference was defined as greater than 
10%.
RESULTS: Among 500 randomized participants, 496 (99%) were included in the 
modified intention-to-treat analysis and 411 (82.2%) in the per-protocol 
analysis (median age, 40 years [range, 15-78 years]; 58.4% male; 10.9% had 
diabetes). Median length and width of erythema were 13.0 cm and 10.0 cm. In the 
per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 182 (83.5%) of 218 
participants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 165 
(85.5%) of 193 in the cephalexin group (difference, -2.0%; 95% CI, -9.7% to

occurred in 189 (76.2%) of 248 participants in the cephalexin plus 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 171 (69.0%) of 248 in the cephalexin

There is literature supporting that intravenous (IV) acetaminophen reduces postoperative pain and narcotic use in the total joint population. However, there are no studies comparing the effectiveness of IV vs oral (PO) acetaminophen as part of a standard multimodal perioperative pain regimen.

Methods: One hundred twenty patients undergoing hip and knee arthroplasty surgeries performed by one joint arthroplasty surgeon were prospectively randomized into 2 groups. Group 1 (63 patients) received IV and group 2 (57 patients) received PO acetaminophen in addition to a standard multimodal perioperative pain regimen. Each group received 1 gram of acetaminophen preoperatively and then every 6 hours for 24 hours. The primary outcome was total narcotic use.

There is literature supporting that intravenous (IV) acetaminophen reduces postoperative pain and narcotic use in the total joint population. However, there are no studies comparing the effectiveness of IV vs oral (PO) acetaminophen as part of a standard multimodal perioperative pain regimen.

Methods: One hundred twenty patients undergoing hip and knee arthroplasty surgeries performed by one joint arthroplasty surgeon were prospectively randomized into 2 groups. Group 1 (63 patients) received IV and group 2 (57 patients) received PO acetaminophen in addition to a standard multimodal perioperative pain regimen. Each group received 1 gram of acetaminophen preoperatively and then every 6 hours for 24 hours. Total narcotic use and visual analog scale (VAS) scores were collected every 4 hours postoperatively.

Results: The 24-hour average hydromorphone equivalents given were not different between groups (3.71 vs 3.48) at 24 hours (P = .76), or at any of the individual 4-hour intervals. The 24-hour average visual analog scale scores in group 1 (IV) was 3.00 and in group 2 (PO) was 3.40 (P = .06). None of the 4-hour intervals were significantly different except the first interval (0-4 hour postoperatively), which favored the IV group (P = .03).

temperature management (TTM) at 33В°C to 36В°C in unconscious patients with 
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest for at least 24 hours, but the optimal duration 
of TTM is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether TTM at 33В°C for 48 hours results in better 
neurologic outcomes compared with currently recommended, standard, 24-hour TTM.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was an international, 
investigator-initiated, blinded-outcome-assessor, parallel, pragmatic, 
multicenter, randomized clinical superiority trial in 10 intensive care units 
(ICUs) at 10 university hospitals in 6 European countries. Three hundred 
fifty-five adult, unconscious patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were 
enrolled from February 16, 2013, to June 1, 2016, with final follow-up on 
December 27, 2016.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to TTM (33вЂ‰В±вЂ‰1В°C) for 48 hours (nвЂ‰=вЂ‰176) 
or 24 hours (nвЂ‰=вЂ‰179), followed by gradual rewarming of 0.5В°C per hour until 
reaching 37В°C.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was 6-month neurologic outcome, 
with a Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) score of 1 or 2 used to define 
favorable outcome. Secondary outcomes included 6-month mortality, including time 
to death, the occurrence of adverse events, and intensive care unit resource 
use.
RESULTS: In 355 patients who were randomized (mean age, 60 years; 295 [83%] 
men), 351 (99%) completed the trial. Of these patients, 69% (120/175) in the 
48-hour group had a favorable outcome at 6 months compared with 64% (112/176) in 
the 24-hour group (difference, 4.9%; 95% CI, -5% to 14.8%; relative risk [RR], 
1.08; 95% CI, 0.93-1.25; PвЂ‰=вЂ‰.33). Six-month mortality was 27% (48/175) in the 
48-hour group and 34% (60/177) in the 24-hour group (difference, -6.5%; 95% CI, 
-16.1% to 3.1%; RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.59-1.11; PвЂ‰=вЂ‰.19). There was no significant 
difference in the time to mortality between the 48-hour group and the 24-hour 
group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.54-1.15; PвЂ‰=вЂ‰.22). Adverse events were more 
common in the 48-hour group (97%) than in the 24-hour group (91%) (difference, 
5.6%; 95% CI, 0.6%-10.6%; RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.12; PвЂ‰=вЂ‰.04). The median 
length of intensive care unit stay (151 vs 117 hours; PвЂ‰<вЂ‰.001), but not 
hospital stay (11 vs 12 days; PвЂ‰=вЂ‰.50), was longer in the 48-hour group than in 
the 24-hour group.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In unconscious survivors from out-of-hospital cardiac 
arrest admitted to the ICU, targeted temperature management at 33В°C for 48 hours 
did not significantly improve 6-month neurologic outcome compared with targeted

temperature management (TTM) at 33°C to 36°C in unconscious patients with 
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest for at least 24 hours, but the optimal duration 
of TTM is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether TTM at 33°C for 48 hours results in better 
neurologic outcomes compared with currently recommended, standard, 24-hour TTM.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was an international, 
investigator-initiated, blinded-outcome-assessor, parallel, pragmatic, 
multicenter, randomized clinical superiority trial in 10 intensive care units 
(ICUs) at 10 university hospitals in 6 European countries. Three hundred 
fifty-five adult, unconscious patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were 
enrolled from February 16, 2013, to June 1, 2016, with final follow-up on 
December 27, 2016.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to TTM (33 ± 1°C) for 48 hours (n = 176) 
or 24 hours (n = 179), followed by gradual rewarming of 0.5°C per hour until 
reaching 37°C.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was 6-month neurologic outcome, 
with a Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) score of 1 or 2 used to define 
favorable outcome. Secondary outcomes included 6-month mortality, including time 
to death, the occurrence of adverse events, and intensive care unit resource 
use.
RESULTS: In 355 patients who were randomized (mean age, 60 years; 295 [83%] 
men), 351 (99%) completed the trial. Of these patients, 120/175 (69%) in the 
48-hour group had a favorable outcome at 6 months compared with 112/176 (64%) in 
the 24-hour group (difference, 4.9%; 95% CI, -5% to 14.8%; relative risk [RR], 
1.08; 95% CI, 0.93-1.25; P = .33). Six-month mortality was 48/175 (27%) in the 
48-hour group and 60/177 (34%) in the 24-hour group (difference, -6.5%; 95% CI, 
-16.1% to 3.1%; RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.59-1.11; P = .19). Time to mortality 
between the 48-hour group and the 24-hour group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 
0.54-1.15; P = .22). Adverse events occurred in 97% of the 48-hour group and 91% 
of the 24-hour group (difference, 5.6%; 95% CI, 0.6%-10.6%; RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 
1.01-1.12; P = .04). The median length of intensive care unit stay was 151 hours 
in the 48-hour group versus 117 hours in the 24-hour group (P < .001), and 
hospital stay was 11 versus 12 days (P = .50).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Targeted temperature management at 33°C for 48 hours 
was not more effective on 6-month neurologic outcome than targeted temperature 
management at 33°C for 24 hours in unconscious survivors from out-of-hospital 
cardiac arrest admitted to the ICU.",spin,4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.5949263572692871, 'probability': 0.5516031980514526}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.006659456994384527, 'probability': 0.9933626055717468}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.5266151428222656, 'probability': 0.5906006693840027}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.005145758390426636, 'probability': 0.9948675036430359}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.825539231300354, 'probability': 0.4379987418651581}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.007385214790701866, 'probability': 0.9926419854164124}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.1936376094818115, 'probability': 0.3031166195869446}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.005700758658349514, 'probability': 0.9943154454231262}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -1.2116658687591553, 'probability': 0.2977009117603302}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.004888013005256653, 'probability': 0.9951239228248596}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]"

ondansetron (n = 52) or placebo (n = 52). The number of diarrhoea and vomiting 
episodes during the 24 hours following treatment was reported as well as the 
number of days with symptoms. Pathogens in faeces were diagnosed by real-time 
PCR. Outcome parameters were analyzed for rotavirus- and norovirus-positive 
children.
RESULTS: One dose of oral ondansetron reduced duration of rotavirus clinical 
symptoms (p = 0.014), with a median of two days. Furthermore, ondansetron 
reduced diarrhea episodes, most pronounced in children that had been sick for 
more than 3 days before treatment (p = 0.028).
CONCLUSION: Ondansetron may be a beneficial treatment for children with 
rotavirus gastroenteritis.",no_spin,7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -0.6562552452087402, 'probability': 0.5187904238700867}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0028820191510021687, 'probability': 0.9971221685409546}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.41050684452056885, 'probability': 0.6633139848709106}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.004553426057100296, 'probability': 0.995456874370575}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.4883731007575989, 'probability': 0.613623857498169}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0022712168283760548, 'probability': 0.9977313280105591}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.8921532034873962, 'probability': 0.40977248549461365}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.003370321122929454, 'probability': 0.996635377407074}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.4169978201389313, 'probability': 0.6590223908424377}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.002597056096419692, 'probability': 0.9974062442779541}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]"

conservative option for knee degeneration to provide symptomatic relief and 
delay surgical intervention. Although the current literature provides some 
evidence on the benefits of this technique compared with viscosupplementation, 
no studies have been performed to compare their long-term effects.
PURPOSE: To compare the long-term clinical outcomes provided by intra-articular 
injections of either PRP or hyaluronic acid (HA) to treat knee degenerative 
disease.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: Patients with a history of chronic symptomatic knee degenerative 
changes and osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 0-3) were enrolled: 192 
patients were randomized to undergo 3 blinded weekly intra-articular injections 
of either PRP or HA. Patients were prospectively evaluated before the injection 
and then at 2, 6, 12, and 24 months and a mean of 64.3 months (SD, 7.8 months) 
of follow-up. Evaluation was based on International Knee Documentation Committee 
(IKDC) subjective (primary outcome), EuroQol visual analog scale, and Tegner 
scores; 167 patients reached the final evaluation.
RESULTS: Mean ± SD IKDC subjective score for PRP group changed from 53.3 ± 14.3 
at baseline to 67.3 ± 18.1 at 24 months and to 60.5 ± 19.0 at final evaluation. 
Mean ± SD IKDC subjective score for HA group changed from 50.3 ± 13.2 at 
baseline to 62.1 ± 20.8 at 24 months and to 55.7 ± 18.8 at final evaluation. A 
comparative analysis showed no significant intergroup difference in any of the 
clinical scores at any follow-up point. The median duration of patient 
subjective perception of symptomatic relief was 9 months for HA and 12 months 
for PRP (not significant). The rate of reintervention at 24 months was 22.6% in 
the PRP group versus 37.1% in the HA group (P = .036).

248,30545242,Platelet-Rich Plasma Intra-articular Knee Injections Show No Superiority Versus Viscosupplementation: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,"  Focus on (+) secondary endpoint,   Other",,Orthopaedic,claude_4.0-sonnet,"BACKGROUND: Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections have been proposed as a new 
conservative option for knee degeneration to provide symptomatic relief and 
delay surgical intervention. Although the current literature provides some 
evidence on the benefits of this technique compared with viscosupplementation, 
no studies have been performed to compare their long-term effects.
PURPOSE: To compare the long-term clinical outcomes provided by intra-articular 
injections of either PRP or hyaluronic acid (HA) to treat knee degenerative 
disease.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: Patients with a history of chronic symptomatic knee degenerative 
changes and osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 0-3) were enrolled: 192 
patients were randomized to undergo 3 blinded weekly intra-articular injections 
of either PRP or HA. Patients were prospectively evaluated before the injection 
and then at 2, 6, 12, and 24 months and a mean of 64.3 months (SD, 7.8 months) 
of follow-up. Evaluation was based on International Knee Documentation Committee 
(IKDC) subjective (main outcome), EuroQol visual analog scale, and Tegner 
scores; 167 patients reached the final evaluation.
RESULTS: Both treatments were effective in improving knee functional status and 
symptoms over time: Mean В± SD IKDC subjective score improved significantly for 
both PRP and HA groups ( P < .0005) and remained stable over time up to 24 
months (from 53.3 В± 14.3 to 67.3 В± 18.1 and from 50.3 В± 13.2 to 62.1 В± 20.8 for 
PRP and HA groups, respectively). At final evaluation, a significant IKDC 
reduction was observed in both treatment groups, with the PRP group still 
presenting significantly higher values compared with baseline: PRP 60.5 В± 19.0 ( 
P < .001 vs baseline), HA 55.7 В± 18.8 (not significant vs baseline). A 
comparative analysis showed no significant intergroup difference in any of the 
clinical scores at any follow-up point. The median duration of patient 
subjective perception of symptomatic relief was 9 months for HA and 12 months 
for PRP (not significant). The only significant difference was observed in the 
rate of reintervention at 24 months, which was significantly lower in the PRP 
group (22.6% vs 37.1%, P = .036).
CONCLUSION: Both treatments were effective in improving knee functional status 
and symptoms over time. PRP did not provide an overall superior clinical 
improvement compared with HA in terms of either symptomatic-functional 
improvement at different follow-up points or effect duration.

PURPOSE: To perform a network meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials

RESULTS: There were 13 studies (868 patients) included, with 9 studies comparing 
LP-PRP with a control and 4 studies comparing LR-PRP with a control. LP-PRP was 
found to significantly reduce the rate of retear and/or incomplete tendon

nutrient metabolism. Severe obesity is considered a state of meta-inflammation 
associated with obesity that influences the development of chronic-degenerative

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to establish the immunometabolic differences in bariatric 
patients and to determine whether cellular immunity is associated with metabolic 
changes.
METHODOLOGY: We conducted an observational study in patients who underwent 
laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 
(LRYGB). We explored the differences in the immunometabolic profile before and 
after surgery in the study group, by surgical technique, and we evaluated the 
changes in immunological variables as a function of metabolic variables with 
correlation analysis.
RESULTS: The follow-up rate was 88.7%. After the intervention, there were 
changes in cellular immunity, with a decrease in effector T lymphocytes 
(CD8+CD28-) and an increase in B lymphocytes, memory helper T cells, and 
cytotoxic T lymphocytes. LSG resulted in a decrease in (CD4+CD62-) T 
lymphocytes compared with LRYGB. Patients who underwent surgery with LRYGB 
showed clinical and metabolic changes, as well as changes in obesity-associated 
medical problems. Women who underwent LRYGB showed a reduction in fat-free mass
