        "abstract": "Purpose\nTo determine if anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is superior to anatomic single-bundle reconstruction in restoring the stabilities and functions of the knee joint.\nMethods\nA prospective randomized clinical study was done to compare the results of 32 cases of anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction and 34 cases of anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction with average follow-up of 16.3 \u0412\u00b1 3.1\u0412\u00a0months. Tunnel placements of all the cases were measured on 3D CT. Clinical results were collected after reconstruction; graft's appearance, meniscus status and cartilage state under arthroscopy were compared and analysed too.\nResults\nTunnel placements, confirmed with 3D CT, were in the anatomic positions as described in literature both in SB and DB group. No differences were found between SB and DB groups in clinical outcome scores, pivot shift test and KT 1000\u0412\u00a0measurements (average side-to-side difference for anterior tibial translation was 0.7\u0412\u00a0mm in SB group and 1.0\u0412\u00a0mm in DB group). More than 70 % of the single-bundle graft and AM bundle graft in DB group appeared excellent, but only 44.1 % of PL bundle grafts in DB group were excellent and 11.8 % were in poor state. No new menisci tear was found either in SB or DB group, however, in DB group cartilage damages in medial patella-femoral joint occurred in 38.2 % cases. This rate was significantly higher than in the SB group which is only 9.3 %.\nConclusion\nBoth single- and double-bundle anatomic ACL reconstruction can restore the knee's stability and functions very well. However, more incidences of poor PL status and medial patellar-femoral cartilage damage may occur in double-bundle ACL reconstruction.",

        "abstract": "Purpose\nTo determine if anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is superior to anatomic single-bundle reconstruction in restoring the stabilities and functions of the knee joint.\nMethods\nA prospective randomized clinical study was done to compare the results of 32 cases of anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction and 34 cases of anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction with average follow-up of 16.3 \u00b1 3.1 months. The primary outcome was clinical outcome scores. Secondary outcomes included pivot shift test, KT 1000 measurements, graft appearance, meniscus status and cartilage state under arthroscopy. Tunnel placements of all the cases were measured on 3D CT.\nResults\nTunnel placements, confirmed with 3D CT, were in the anatomic positions as described in literature both in SB and DB group. No differences were found between SB and DB groups in clinical outcome scores, pivot shift test and KT 1000 measurements (average side-to-side difference for anterior tibial translation was 0.7 mm in SB group and 1.0 mm in DB group). More than 70% of the single-bundle graft and AM bundle graft in DB group appeared excellent, but only 44.1% of PL bundle grafts in DB group were excellent and 11.8% were in poor state. No new menisci tear was found either in SB or DB group, however, in DB group cartilage damages in medial patella-femoral joint occurred in 38.2% cases. This rate was significantly higher than in the SB group which is only 9.3%.\nConclusion\nAnatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction was not more effective than anatomic single-bundle reconstruction in patients with ACL injury.",

Subjects were randomized to receive a 20 mL/kg infusion of either 5% \ndextrose in normal saline solution or normal saline solution. Serum ketone \nlevels were measured before and at 1- and 2-hour intervals after the initial \nstudy fluid bolus administration. Primary outcome was the proportion of children \nhospitalized. Secondary outcome was change in serum ketone levels over time.\nRESULTS: One hundred eighty-eight children were enrolled. The proportion of \nchildren hospitalized did not differ between groups (35% in the 5% dextrose in \nnormal saline solution group versus 44% in the normal saline solution group; \nrisk difference 9%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -5% to 22%). Compared with \nchildren who received normal saline solution, those who received 5% dextrose in \nnormal saline solution had a greater reduction in mean serum ketone levels at \nboth 1 hour (mean \u041e\u201d 1.2 versus 0.1 mmol/L; mean difference 1.1 mmol/L; 95% CI \n0.4 to 1.9 mmol/L) and 2 hours (mean \u041e\u201d 1.9 versus 0.3 mmol/L; mean difference \n1.6 mmol/L; 95% CI 0.9 to 2.3 mmol/L).\nCONCLUSION: Administration of a dextrose-containing bolus compared with normal \nsaline did not lead to a lower rate of hospitalization for children with \ngastroenteritis and dehydration. There was, however, a greater reduction in \nserum ketone levels in patients who received 5% dextrose in normal saline \nsolution.",

Secondary outcome was change in serum ketone levels over time.\nRESULTS: One hundred eighty-eight children were enrolled. The proportion of \nchildren hospitalized did not differ between groups (35% in the 5% dextrose in \nnormal saline solution group versus 44% in the normal saline solution group; \nrisk difference 9%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -5% to 22%). Children who received 5% dextrose in \nnormal saline solution had a reduction in mean serum ketone levels at \nboth 1 hour (mean \u0394 1.2 versus 0.1 mmol/L; mean difference 1.1 mmol/L; 95% CI \n0.4 to 1.9 mmol/L) and 2 hours (mean \u0394 1.9 versus 0.3 mmol/L; mean difference \n1.6 mmol/L; 95% CI 0.9 to 2.3 mmol/L).\nCONCLUSION: 5% dextrose in normal saline solution was not more effective than normal saline solution on hospitalization rates in children with gastroenteritis and dehydration.",

Patient pain levels were measured using the visual analog scale (VAS) at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h post-operatively. Additionally, the number of boluses and total amount of fentanyl dispensed by patient-controlled analgesia administration during the 24-h post-operative period were evaluated.\n\nResults: VAS scores did not differ significantly between groups I and II during the 24-h post-operative period. Mean fentanyl bolus consumption was significantly less in group I compared with group II (p = 0.015).\n\nConclusion: Arthroscopy-guided suprascapular nerve block was not more effective than placebo in reducing post-operative pain in patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of arthroscopy-guided direct suprascapular nerve block performed after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.\n\nMethods: In the present prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical study, 30 patients were divided into two groups: 15 patients (group I) were treated with arthroscopy-guided suprascapular nerve block using 10 mL 0.5 % ropivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine, and 15 patients (group II) were treated with placebo using 10 mL 0.9 % saline after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Patient pain levels were measured using the visual analog scale (VAS) at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h post-operatively. Additionally, the number of boluses and total amount of fentanyl dispensed by patient-controlled analgesia administration during the 24-h post-operative period were evaluated.\n\nResults: VAS scores did not differ significantly between groups I and II during the 24-h post-operative period, but mean fentanyl bolus consumption was significantly less in group I compared with group II (p = 0.015).\n\nConclusion: Arthroscopy-guided suprascapular nerve block at the end of a rotator cuff repair was safe and less time-consuming than expected. Although this procedure did not significantly reduce the post-operative pain, the post-operative need for fentanyl boluses as analgesia was reduced significantly, and it would be beneficial if this procedure involved a sensory branch of axillary nerve block or was performed at the beginning of the arthroscopic procedure.",

Subjects were randomly assigned to usual care or one of 3 prescription information or services intervention groups: (1) practical services to reduce barriers to prescription filling (practical prescription information or services); (2) consumer drug information from MedlinePlus (MedlinePlus prescription information or services); or (3) both services and information (combination prescription information or services). Self-reported medication adherence, measured by primary adherence (prescription filling) and persistence (receiving medicine as prescribed) rates, was determined during a telephone interview 1 week postdischarge.\n\nResults: Of the 3,940 subjects enrolled and randomly allocated to treatment, 86% (N=3,386) completed the follow-up interview. Overall, primary adherence was 88% and persistence was 48%. Across the sites, primary adherence and persistence did not differ significantly between usual care and the prescription information or services groups. However, at site C, subjects who received the practical prescription information or services (odds ratio [OR]=2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4 to 4.3) or combination prescription information or services (OR=1.8; 95% CI 1.1 to 3.1) were more likely to fill their prescription compared with usual care. Among subjects prescribed a drug that treats an underlying condition, subjects who received the practical prescription information or services were more likely to fill their prescription (OR=1.8; 95% CI 1.0 to 3.1) compared with subjects who received usual care.\n\nConclusion: Prescription filling and receiving medications as prescribed was not meaningfully improved by offering patients patient-centered prescription information and services.",

Subjects were randomly assigned to usual care or one of 3 prescription information or services intervention groups: (1) practical services to reduce barriers to prescription filling (practical prescription information or services); (2) consumer drug information from MedlinePlus (MedlinePlus prescription information or services); or (3) both services and information (combination prescription information or services). Self-reported medication adherence, measured by primary adherence (prescription filling) and persistence (receiving medicine as prescribed) rates, was determined during a telephone interview 1 week postdischarge.\n\nResults: Of the 3,940 subjects enrolled and randomly allocated to treatment, 86% (N=3,386) completed the follow-up interview. Overall, primary adherence was 88% and persistence was 48%. Primary adherence and persistence did not differ significantly between usual care and the prescription information or services groups.\n\nConclusion: The prescription information or services interventions were not more effective than usual care in improving medication adherence in emergency department patients.",

Despite intensive marketing by the manufacturers, this claim has not yet been confirmed in a controlled prospective trial.\n\nQuestions/purposes: We (1) compared three-planar component alignment and overall coronal mechanical alignment between PSG and conventional instrumentation and (2) logged the need for applying changes in the suggested position of the PSG.\n\nMethods: In this randomized controlled trial, we enrolled 128 patients. The primary outcome was overall coronal mechanical alignment. Secondary outcomes included femoral coronal alignment, femoral axial alignment, tibial coronal alignment, and tibial sagittal alignment. In the PSG cohort, surgical navigation was used as an intraoperative control. When the suggested cut deviated more than 3\u00b0 from target, the use of PSG was abandoned and marked as an outlier. When cranial-caudal position or size was adapted, the PSG was marked as modified. All patients underwent long-leg standing radiography and CT scan. Deviation of more than 3\u00b0 from the target in any plane was defined as an outlier.\n\nResults: The PSG and conventional cohorts showed similar numbers of outliers in overall coronal alignment (25% versus 28%; p = 0.69). There were more outliers in tibial coronal (15% versus 3%; p = 0.03) and sagittal (21% versus 3%; p = 0.002) alignment in the PSG group than in the conventional group. The PSG group showed similar outlier rates for femoral coronal alignment (7% versus 14%; p = 0.24) and femoral axial alignment (23% versus 17%; p = 0.50). PSGs were abandoned in 14 patients (22%) and modified in 18 (28%).\n\nConclusions: PSGs were not more effective than conventional instrumentation for overall coronal mechanical alignment in patients undergoing TKA.",

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of the two procedures in patients older than 55 years of age affected by reparable rotator cuff tears with concomitant long head biceps pathologies.\n\nMethods: Patients older than 55 years of age with long head biceps lesions and reparable rotator cuff tears were selected for this study. A total of 151 patients were randomly assigned to the tenotomy group (77 patients) or the tenodesis group (74 patients). Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was performed in all the patients. Before surgery, physical and radiological examinations were performed; the constant score was measured as well. After the operation, the surgical time, cost, pain (VAS scores), Popeye sign, cramping pain, constant scores, satisfaction level and the elbow flexion and forearm supination strength indices were recorded.\n\nResults: Patients were followed for an average of 24 months. No significant differences in the clinical results for the constant scores, the forearm supination and elbow flexion strength indices, Popeye sign, cramping pain and satisfaction level were found between the groups. However, tenotomy required a shorter surgical time (40.4 \u00b1 4.0 vs. 50.4 \u00b1 5.9 min, P < 0.001) and resulted in faster pain relief (3.1 \u00b1 1.8 vs. 4.8 \u00b1 1.9, P < 0.001).\n\nConclusion: Both tenotomy and tenodesis are effective and equal for the treatment of long head biceps lesions. However, because tenotomy requires a shorter surgical time and results in faster pain relief, tenotomy may be more suitable for the treatment of long head biceps lesions in patients older than 55 years of age with reparable rotator cuff tears.",

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of the two procedures in patients older than 55 years of age affected by reparable rotator cuff tears with concomitant long head biceps pathologies.\n\nMethods: Patients older than 55 years of age with long head biceps lesions and reparable rotator cuff tears were selected for this study. A total of 151 patients were randomly assigned to the tenotomy group (77 patients) or the tenodesis group (74 patients). Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was performed in all the patients. The primary outcome was the constant score. Before surgery, physical and radiological examinations were performed; the constant score was measured as well. After the operation, the surgical time, cost, pain (VAS scores), Popeye sign, cramping pain, constant scores, satisfaction level and the elbow flexion and forearm supination strength indices were recorded.\n\nResults: Patients were followed for an average of 24 months. No significant differences in the clinical results for the constant scores, the forearm supination and elbow flexion strength indices, Popeye sign, cramping pain and satisfaction level were found between the groups. Tenotomy required a shorter surgical time (40.4 \u00b1 4.0 vs. 50.4 \u00b1 5.9 min, P < 0.001) and resulted in faster pain relief (3.1 \u00b1 1.8 vs. 4.8 \u00b1 1.9, P < 0.001).\n\nConclusion: Tenotomy was not more effective on constant scores than tenodesis in patients older than 55 years of age with reparable rotator cuff tears and concomitant long head biceps pathologies.",

At a minimum followup of 4.9 years (mean, 5.9 years; range, 4.9-7.2 years), 68 of the 70 surviving patients were examined by a study nurse and study physiotherapist blinded to initial treatment. Questionnaires on hip function (Harris hip score), quality of life (Eq5D), and activity of daily living function (Barthel ADL) were administered. The Barthel ADL index score was split into good function (score 95 or 100) and reduced function (score below 95).\n\nResults: The mean survival of the groups was similar with 66.4% (73 of 110) of the patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty and 70.5% (79 of 112) of the patients undergoing internal fixation having died since surgery (p = 0.51). Only 12 of 31 living patients in the internal fixation group had retained their native hips at a mean of 6 years. Between 2 and 6 years, there were two new major reoperations (both in the internal fixation group, for avascular necrosis and deep wound infection). The mean Harris hip score was 66 (SD 19) and 67 (SD 20) in the internal fixation and hemiarthroplasty groups, respectively (p = 0.96). The mean Eq5D index was 0.50 (SD 0.40) in the internal fixation group and 0.34 (SD 0.36) in the hemiarthroplasty group (p = 0.10).

        "abstract": "Background: The infrapatellar fat pad is one of the structures that obscures exposure in minimally invasive total knee arthroplasty (MIS TKA). Most MIS TKA surgeons (and many surgeons who use other approaches as well) excise the fat pad for better exposure of the knee. There is still controversy about the result of fat pad excision on patella baja, pain, and function.\n\nQuestions/purposes: In the setting of a randomized controlled trial, we sought to determine whether infrapatellar fat pad excision during MIS TKA causes (1) patellar tendon shortening (as measured by patella baja); (2) increased anterior knee pain; (3) decreases in the Knee Society Score or functional subscore; or (4) more patella-related complications.\n\nMethods: We randomized 90 patients undergoing MIS TKA at one institution into two groups. In one group, 45 patients underwent MIS TKA with complete infrapatellar fat pad excision and in the other group, 45 patients received MIS TKA without infrapatellar fat pad excision. The patella was selectively resurfaced in these patients; there was no difference between the groups in terms of the percentage of patients whose patellae were resurfaced. We measured patellar tendon shortening, knee flexion, anterior knee pain, Knee Society Score (KSS), functional subscore, and patellar complications at preoperative and postoperative periods of 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year; complete followup data were available on 86% of patients (77 of 90) who were enrolled.\n\nResults: At the final followup, no significant differences were observed in patellar tendon shortening, KSS, functional subscore, or knee flexion in either group. However, patients with their infrapatellar fat pad excised experienced more anterior knee pain (8.3% versus 0%; p = 0.03; 95% confidence interval, -0.007 to 0.174) at the end of the study. No patellar complications were found in either group.\n\nConclusions: Infrapatellar fat pad excision in MIS TKA resulted in an increasing small percentage of patients with anterior knee pain after surgery. Surgeons should keep the fat pad if excellent exposure can be achieved but resect it if needed to improve exposure during TKA.",

        "abstract": "Background: The infrapatellar fat pad is one of the structures that obscures exposure in minimally invasive total knee arthroplasty (MIS TKA). Most MIS TKA surgeons (and many surgeons who use other approaches as well) excise the fat pad for better exposure of the knee. There is still controversy about the result of fat pad excision on patella baja, pain, and function.\n\nQuestions/purposes: In the setting of a randomized controlled trial, we sought to determine whether infrapatellar fat pad excision during MIS TKA causes (1) patellar tendon shortening (as measured by patella baja); (2) increased anterior knee pain; (3) decreases in the Knee Society Score or functional subscore; or (4) more patella-related complications.\n\nMethods: We randomized 90 patients undergoing MIS TKA at one institution into two groups. In one group, 45 patients underwent MIS TKA with complete infrapatellar fat pad excision and in the other group, 45 patients received MIS TKA without infrapatellar fat pad excision. The primary outcome was patellar tendon shortening. Secondary outcomes included knee flexion, anterior knee pain, Knee Society Score (KSS), functional subscore, and patellar complications. The patella was selectively resurfaced in these patients; there was no difference between the groups in terms of the percentage of patients whose patellae were resurfaced. We measured outcomes at preoperative and postoperative periods of 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year; complete followup data were available on 86% of patients (77 of 90) who were enrolled.\n\nResults: At the final followup, no significant differences were observed in patellar tendon shortening between groups. No significant differences were observed in KSS, functional subscore, or knee flexion in either group. Patients with their infrapatellar fat pad excised experienced more anterior knee pain (8.3% versus 0%; p = 0.03; 95% confidence interval, -0.007 to 0.174) at the end of the study. No patellar complications were found in either group.\n\nConclusions: Infrapatellar fat pad excision was not more effective than fat pad preservation on patellar tendon shortening in patients undergoing MIS TKA.",

A prospective blinded randomized controlled trial was completed with 103 patients randomized to measured resection (n = 52) or gap balancing (n = 51). Primary outcome measure was femoral component rotation. Secondary outcome measures were joint-line change, gap symmetry and function and quality-of-life outcomes. Gap balancing resulted in a significantly raised joint-line compared to measured resection. Gap symmetry was significantly better using gap balancing. Functional outcomes and quality-of-life were not significantly different at 24 months. Using computer navigation, gap balancing significantly raises the joint-line in order to improve gap symmetry. This does not result in a clinical difference in function or quality of life at 24 months.",

        "abstract": "A total knee arthroplasty can be completed using two techniques; measured resection or gap balancing. A prospective blinded randomized controlled trial was completed with 103 patients randomized to measured resection (n = 52) or gap balancing (n = 51). Primary outcome measure was femoral component rotation. Secondary outcome measures were joint-line change, gap symmetry and function and quality-of-life outcomes. There was no significant difference in femoral component rotation between groups. Gap balancing resulted in a significantly raised joint-line compared to measured resection. Gap symmetry was significantly better using gap balancing. Functional outcomes and quality-of-life were not significantly different at 24 months. Gap balancing was not more effective than measured resection on femoral component rotation in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.",

Our objective was to evaluate the \neffectiveness of story booklets compared to standard information sheets for \nparents of children attending the emergency department (ED) with a child with \ncroup.\nMETHODS: Parents were randomized to receive story booklets (n=208) or standard \ninformation sheets (n=205) during their ED visit. The primary outcome was change \nin anxiety between triage to ED discharge as measured by the State-Trait Anxiety \nInventory. Follow-up telephone interviews were conducted at 1 and 3 days after \ndischarge, then every other day until 9 days (or until resolution of symptoms), \nand at 1 year. Secondary outcomes included: expected future anxiety, event \nimpact, parental knowledge, satisfaction, decision regret, healthcare \nutilization, time to symptom resolution.\nRESULTS: There was no significant difference in the primary outcome of change in \nparental anxiety between recruitment and ED discharge (change of 5 points for \nthe story group vs. 6 points for the comparison group, p=0.78). The story group \nshowed significantly greater decision regret regarding their decision to go to \nthe ED (p<0.001): 6.7% of the story group vs. 1.5% of the comparison group \nstrongly disagreed with the statement \"I would go for the same choice if I had \nto do it over again\".

No other outcomes were different between \nstudy groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Stories about parent experiences managing a child with croup did \nnot reduce parental anxiety. The story group showed significantly greater \ndecision regret and quicker time to resolution of symptoms. Further research is \nneeded to better understand whether stories can be effective in improving \npatient-important outcomes.",

We seek to \ndetermine whether a scalable, low-cost, unidirectional, text message-based \nmobile health intervention (TExT-MED) improves clinical outcomes, increases \nhealthy behaviors, and decreases ED utilization in a safety net population.\nMETHODS: We conducted an randomized controlled trial of 128 adult patients with \npoorly controlled diabetes (glycosylated hemoglobin [Hb A1C] level \u0432\u2030\u04908%) in an \nurban, public ED. The TExT-MED group received 2 daily text messages for 6 months \nin English or Spanish. The primary outcome was change in Hb A1C level. Secondary \noutcomes included changes in medication adherence, self-efficacy, performance of \nself-care tasks, quality of life, diabetes-specific knowledge, ED utilization, \nand patient satisfaction.\nRESULTS: Hb A1C level decreased by 1.05% in the TExT-MED group compared with \n0.60% in the controls (\u041e\u201d0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.27 to 1.17) at 6 \nmonths. Secondary outcomes favored the TExT-MED group, with the most sizable \nchange observed in self-reported medication adherence (as measured by the \nMorisky Medication Adherence Scale, an 8-point validated scale with higher \nscores representing better adherence), which improved from 4.5 to 5.4 in the \nTExT-MED group compared with a net decrease of -0.1 in the controls (\u041e\u201d1.1 [95% \nCI 0.1 to 2.1]). Effects were larger among Spanish speakers for both medication \nadherence (1.1 versus -0.3; \u041e\u201d1.4; 95% CI 0.2 to 2.7) and Hb A1C (-1.2% versus \n-0.4%) in the TExT-MED group. The proportion of patients who used emergency \nservices trended lower in the TExT-MED group (35.9% versus 51.6%; \u041e\u201d15.7%; 95% CI \n9.4% to 22%). Overall, 93.6% of respondents enjoyed TExT-MED and 100% would \nrecommend it to family/friends.\nCONCLUSION: The TExT-MED program did not result in a statistically significant \nimprovement in Hb A1C. However, trends toward improvement in the primary outcome \nof Hb A1C and other secondary outcomes, including quality of life, were \nobserved, the most pronounced being improved medication adherence. TExT-MED also \ndecreased ED utilization. These findings were magnified in the Spanish-speaking \nsubgroup. Technologies such as TExT-MED represent highly scalable, low-cost, and \nwidely accessible solutions for safety-net ED populations.",

Data \nwere collected at baseline and 18-months after randomisation. The primary \noutcome was admission to hospital under the Mental Health Act. The economic \nevaluation took a service perspective (health, social care and criminal justice \nservices) and a societal perspective (additionally including criminal activity \nand productivity losses).\nFINDINGS: The addition of JCPs to TAU had no significant effect on compulsory \nadmissions or total societal cost per participant over 18-months follow-up. From \nthe service cost perspective, JCPs were not significantly more cost-effective \nthan TAU alone.\nINTERPRETATION: JCPs were not more effective than TAU alone in reducing \ncompulsory admissions in patients with previous psychiatric hospital admissions.",

Improved patient experience and cost reductions could be \nrealised by providing cost-effective crisis planning services.\nMETHODS: Economic evaluation within a multi-centre randomised controlled trial \ncomparing Joint Crisis Plans (JCP) plus treatment as usual (TAU) to TAU alone \nfor patients aged over 16, with at least one psychiatric hospital admission in \nthe previous two years and on the Enhanced Care Programme Approach register. \nJCPs, containing the patient's treatment preferences for any future psychiatric \nemergency, are a form of crisis intervention that aim to mitigate the negative \nconsequences of relapse, including hospital admission and use of coercion. Data \nwere collected at baseline and 18-months after randomisation. The primary \noutcome was admission to hospital under the Mental Health Act. The economic \nevaluation took a service perspective (health, social care and criminal justice \nservices) and a societal perspective (additionally including criminal activity \nand productivity losses).\nFINDINGS: The addition of JCPs to TAU had no significant effect on compulsory \nadmissions or total societal cost per participant over 18-months follow-up. From \nthe service cost perspective, however, evidence suggests a higher probability \n(80%) of JCPs being the more cost-effective option. Exploration by ethnic group \nhighlights distinct patterns of costs and effects. Whilst the evidence does not \nsupport the cost-effectiveness of JCPs for White or Asian ethnic groups, there \nis at least a 90% probability of the JCP intervention being the more \ncost-effective option in the Black ethnic group.\nINTERPRETATION: The results by ethnic group are sufficiently striking to warrant \nfurther investigation into the potential for patient gain from JCPs among black \npatient groups.",

Images were stored, \nand results were reported regarding contractility (good vs. poor), fluid status \n(empty inferior vena cava [hypovolemic] vs. full inferior vena cava [not \nhypovolemic]), and pericardial effusion (present vs. absent). The primary outcome \nwas mortality. Secondary outcomes included time from TB to operating room, \nintravenous fluid administration, blood product requirement, and intensive care \nunit admission.\nRESULTS: A total of 240 patients were randomized. Twenty-five patients were \nexcluded since they died upon arrival to the TB, leaving 215 patients in the \nstudy. Ninety-two patients were in the LTTEp group with 123 patients in the \nnon-LTTE group. The LTTEp and non-LTTE groups were similar in age (38 years vs. \n38.8 years, p = 0.75), Injury Severity Score (ISS) (19.2 vs. 19.0, p = 0.94), \nRevised Trauma Score (RTS) (5.5 vs. 6.0, p = 0.09), lactate (4.2 vs. 3.6, p = \n0.14), and mechanism of injury (p = 0.44). LTTEp had less intravenous fluid than \nnon-LTTE patients (1.5 L vs. 2.5 L, p < 0.0001), less time from TB to operating \nroom (35.6 minutes vs. 79.1 min, p = 0.0006), higher rate of intensive care unit \nadmission (80.4% vs. 67.2%, p = 0.04), and a mortality rate of 11% vs. 19.5% (p = \n0.09).\nCONCLUSION: LTTE was not more effective on mortality than standard care in \nhypotensive trauma patients during the early phase of resuscitation.",

Images were stored, \nand results were reported regarding contractility (good vs. poor), fluid status \n(empty inferior vena cava [hypovolemic] vs. full inferior vena cava [not \nhypovolemic]), and pericardial effusion (present vs. absent). Time from TB to \noperating room, intravenous fluid administration, blood product requirement, \nintensive care unit admission, and mortality were examined in both groups.\nRESULTS: A total of 240 patients were randomized. Twenty-five patients were \nexcluded since they died upon arrival to the TB, leaving 215 patients in the \nstudy. Ninety-two patients were in the LTTEp group with 123 patients in the \nnon-LTTE group. The LTTEp and non-LTTE groups were similar in age (38 years vs. \n38.8 years, p = 0.75), Injury Severity Score (ISS) (19.2 vs. 19.0, p = 0.94), \nRevised Trauma Score (RTS) (5.5 vs. 6.0, p = 0.09), lactate (4.2 vs. 3.6, p = \n0.14), and mechanism of injury (p = 0.44). Strikingly, LTTEp had significantly \nless intravenous fluid than non-LTTE patients (1.5 L vs. 2.5 L, p < 0.0001), \nless time from TB to operating room (35.6 minutes vs. 79.1 min, p = 0.0006), \nhigher rate of intensive care unit admission (80.4% vs. 67.2%, p = 0.04), and a \nlower mortality rate (11% vs. 19.5%, p = 0.09). Mortality differences were \nparticularly evident in the traumatic brain injury patients (14.7% in LTTEp vs. \n39.5% in non-LTTE, p = 0.03).\nCONCLUSION: LTTE is a useful guide for therapy in hypotensive trauma patients \nduring the early phase of resuscitation.",

The hypothesis of the present study \nwas that compared with the PCR technique, the PS technique is associated with a \nhigher amount of postoperative blood loss and greater need for blood transfusion \nin cemented TKA.\nMETHODS: In this prospective, randomized study, 100 patients diagnosed with \nprimary knee osteoarthritis were randomly assigned to either the PCR group \n(Group I) or the PS group (Group II). The exclusion criteria were \nrheumatological joint disease, previous knee surgery, anticoagulant therapy and \nhypertension. There were no significant differences in age, body mass index and \ngender, between the groups. The haemoglobin and haematocrit levels of each \npatient were recorded preoperatively and on postoperative days 1, 3 and 5. The \npostoperative suction drainage and blood transfusion volumes were also recorded.\nRESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in haemoglobin or \nhaematocrit levels between the groups on postoperative days 1, 3 and 5. There \nwere also no statistically significant differences in the total measured blood \nloss volume, postoperative drainage amounts or transfusion rates between the \ngroups.\nCONCLUSION: Use of the PS technique during cemented TKA does not appear to \ninfluence the amount of perioperative blood loss or the need for postoperative \nblood transfusion in general. The clinical relevance of this study is that the \ndifference in blood loss between the PCR and PS techniques does not need to be \nconsidered by surgeons when performing TKA.",

Pain scores of the bupivacaine group were significantly lower than those of the control group the first 12hours postoperatively (all, P<0.001). A significantly lower dose of meperidine was used in the study group than in the control group the first 24hours postoperatively (median, 25 vs. 45mg, P<0.001). Nineteen patients in the study group required meperidine the first day after surgery, as compared to 45 patients in the control group. We conclude that intra-articular injection of bupivacaine after THA reduces pain and meperidine use in the first 12hours after surgery.",

Pain scores of the bupivacaine group were significantly lower than those of the control group the first 12hours postoperatively (all, P<0.001). A significantly lower dose of meperidine was used in the study group than in the control group the first 24hours postoperatively (median, 25 vs. 45mg, P<0.001). Nineteen patients in the study group required meperidine the first day after surgery, as compared to 45 patients in the control group.

All the patients were treated with the same anaesthesia method, surgical team, surgical technique, prosthesis type, and rehabilitation process. American Knee Society Score values and knee flexion degrees were recorded. Isokinetic muscle strength measurements of both knees in flexion and extension were taken using 60\u0412\u00b0 and 180\u0412\u00b0/s angular velocity. The peak torque and total work values, isokinetic muscle strength differences, and total work difference values were calculated for surgically repaired and healthy knees.\nResults:\u0412\u00a0No significant difference in the mean American Knee Society Score values and knee flexion degrees was observed between the two groups. However, using isokinetic evaluation, a significant difference was found in the isokinetic muscle strength differences and total work difference of the flexor muscle between the two groups when patients were tested at 180\u0412\u00b0/s. Less loss of strength was detected in the isokinetic muscle strength differences of the flexor muscle in Group 2 (-4.2%) than in Group 1 (-23.1%).\nConclusion:\u0412\u00a0For patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty, post-operative flexor muscle strength is improved if the knee is flexed during wound closure.",

        "abstract": "Background: Physiotherapy treatment of frozen shoulder is varied, but most lack specific focus on the underlying disorder, which is the adhered shoulder capsule. Although positive effects were found after physiotherapy, the recurrence and prolonged disability of a frozen shoulder are major factors to focus on to provide the appropriate treatment.\n\nQuestions/purposes: We wished to study the effectiveness of a shoulder countertraction apparatus on ROM, pain, and function in patients with a frozen shoulder and compare their results with those of control subjects who received conventional physiotherapy.\n\nMethods: A total of 100 participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group and a control group, with each group having 50 participants. The control group received physiotherapy and the experimental group received countertraction and physiotherapy. The total treatment time was 20 minutes a day for 5 days per week for 2 weeks. The outcome measures used were goniometer measurements, VAS, and the Oxford Shoulder Score.\n\nResults: Improvements were seen in the scores for shoulder flexion (94.1\u040e \u00b1 19.79\u040e at baseline increased to 161.9\u040e \u00b1 13.05\u040e after intervention), abduction ROM (90.4\u040e \u00b1 21.18\u040e at baseline increased to 154.8\u040e \u00b1 13.21\u040e after intervention), and pain (8.00 \u00b1 0.78 at baseline decreased to 3.48 \u00b1 0.71 after intervention) in the experimental group. Sixty percent of the participants (n = 30) were improved to the fourth stage of satisfactory joint function according to the Oxford Shoulder Score in the experimental group compared with 18% (n = 9) in the control group (p < 0.001).\n\nConclusions: Incorporating shoulder countertraction along with physiotherapy improves shoulder function compared with physiotherapy alone for the treatment of a frozen shoulder. Additional studies are needed focusing on this concept to increase the generalizability of the counter-traction apparatus in various groups.",

        "abstract": "Background: Physiotherapy treatment of frozen shoulder is varied, but most lack specific focus on the underlying disorder, which is the adhered shoulder capsule. Although positive effects were found after physiotherapy, the recurrence and prolonged disability of a frozen shoulder are major factors to focus on to provide the appropriate treatment.\n\nQuestions/purposes: We wished to study the effectiveness of a shoulder countertraction apparatus on ROM, pain, and function in patients with a frozen shoulder and compare their results with those of control subjects who received conventional physiotherapy.\n\nMethods: A total of 100 participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group and a control group, with each group having 50 participants. The control group received physiotherapy and the experimental group received countertraction and physiotherapy. The total treatment time was 20 minutes a day for 5 days per week for 2 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Oxford Shoulder Score. Secondary outcome measures included goniometer measurements for range of motion and VAS for pain assessment.\n\nResults: For the primary outcome, 60% of participants (n = 30) achieved the fourth stage of satisfactory joint function according to the Oxford Shoulder Score in the experimental group compared with 18% (n = 9) in the control group (p < 0.001). For secondary outcomes, shoulder flexion improved from 94.1\u00b0 \u00b1 19.79\u00b0 at baseline to 161.9\u00b0 \u00b1 13.05\u00b0 after intervention in the experimental group. Shoulder abduction ROM improved from 90.4\u00b0 \u00b1 21.18\u00b0 at baseline to 154.8\u00b0 \u00b1 13.21\u00b0 after intervention in the experimental group. Pain scores decreased from 8.00 \u00b1 0.78 at baseline to 3.48 \u00b1 0.71 after intervention in the experimental group.\n\nConclusions: Shoulder countertraction along with physiotherapy was more effective than physiotherapy alone on shoulder function in patients with frozen shoulder.",

Patients were assigned to either group, with odd-numbered patients going to the knot-tying suture arm and even-numbered patients assigned to the knotless arm. Outcomes included the Constant score, the visual analog scale (VAS) score, patient satisfaction score, and range of motion in forward flexion and external rotation with the arm in adduction. Redislocations or subluxations with the 2 techniques was also studied.\n\nResults: Both groups showed a statistically significant improvement between the preoperative and postoperative VAS scores and Constant scores. In the knot-tying suture group, the VAS score improved from 2.5 \u00b1 2.3 to 0.7 \u00b1 0.5 (P < .05) and the Constant score improved from 64 \u00b1 7 to 92 \u00b1 10 (P < .05). In the knotless group, the VAS score improved from 2.8 \u00b1 2.5 to 0.9 \u00b1 0.6 (P < .05), and the Constant score improved from 62 \u00b1 6 to 89 \u00b1 9 (P < .05). The patient satisfaction scores were 6.9 and 7.1 for the knot tying and knotless groups, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found when comparing the outcomes between the 2 groups. The change in the range of forward flexion and external rotation was also similar in the 2 groups. There was also no difference in recurrence or redislocation rates.\n\nConclusions: Both the knot-tying and knotless suture anchors groups showed statistically significant and similar improvement in VAS and Constant scores. Both anchors provided reasonable outcomes. The knotless suture anchor is a good alternative to knot-tying suture anchors so that arthroscopic Bankart repairs can be performed without knot tying.",

However, recent basic science and clinical data have suggested recurrent instability may be reduced with immobilization in external rotation after primary shoulder dislocation.\n\nQuestions/purposes: We performed a randomized controlled trial to compare the (1) frequency of recurrent instability and (2) disease-specific quality-of-life scores after treatment of first-time shoulder dislocation using either immobilization in external rotation or immobilization in internal rotation in a group of young patients.\n\nMethods: Sixty patients younger than 35 years of age with primary, traumatic, anterior shoulder dislocations were randomized (concealed, computer-generated) to immobilization with either an internal rotation sling (n = 29) or an external rotation brace (n = 31) at a mean of 4 days after closed reduction (range, 1-7 days). Patients with large bony lesions or polytrauma were excluded. The two groups were similar at baseline. Both groups were immobilized for 4 weeks with identical therapy protocols thereafter. Blinded assessments were completed by independent observers for a minimum of 12 months (mean, 25 months; range, 12-43 months). The primary outcome was recurrent instability, defined as a second documented anterior dislocation or multiple episodes of shoulder subluxation severe enough for the patient to request surgical stabilization. Secondary outcomes included validated disease-specific quality-of-life data (Western Ontario Shoulder Instability index [WOSI], American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons evaluation [ASES]). Ten patients (17%, five from each group) were lost to followup. Reported compliance with immobilization in both groups was excellent (80%).\n\nResults: There was no difference in the rate of recurrent instability between groups: 10 of 27 patients (37%) with the external rotation brace versus 10 of 25 patients (40%) with the sling redislocated or developed symptomatic recurrent instability (p = 0.41). WOSI scores were not different between groups (p = 0.74). ASES scores were not significantly different between groups (p = 0.05).\n\nConclusions: Immobilization in external rotation was not more effective than sling immobilization in the prevention of recurrent instability after primary anterior shoulder dislocation in patients younger than 35 years of age.",

However, recent basic science and clinical data have suggested recurrent instability may be reduced with immobilization in external rotation after primary shoulder dislocation.\n\nQuestions/purposes: We performed a randomized controlled trial to compare the (1) frequency of recurrent instability and (2) disease-specific quality-of-life scores after treatment of first-time shoulder dislocation using either immobilization in external rotation or immobilization in internal rotation in a group of young patients.\n\nMethods: Sixty patients younger than 35 years of age with primary, traumatic, anterior shoulder dislocations were randomized (concealed, computer-generated) to immobilization with either an internal rotation sling (n = 29) or an external rotation brace (n = 31) at a mean of 4 days after closed reduction (range, 1-7 days). Patients with large bony lesions or polytrauma were excluded. The two groups were similar at baseline. Both groups were immobilized for 4 weeks with identical therapy protocols thereafter. Blinded assessments were completed by independent observers for a minimum of 12 months (mean, 25 months; range, 12-43 months). Recurrent instability was defined as a second documented anterior dislocation or multiple episodes of shoulder subluxation severe enough for the patient to request surgical stabilization. Validated disease-specific quality-of-life data (Western Ontario Shoulder Instability index [WOSI], American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons evaluation [ASES]) were also collected. Ten patients (17%, five from each group) were lost to followup. Reported compliance with immobilization in both groups was excellent (80%).\n\nResults: With the numbers available, there was no difference in the rate of recurrent instability between groups: 10 of 27 patients (37%) with the external rotation brace versus 10 of 25 patients (40%) with the sling redislocated or developed symptomatic recurrent instability (p = 0.41). WOSI scores were not different between groups (p = 0.74) and, although the difference in ASES scores approached statistical significance (p = 0.05), the magnitude of this difference was small and of uncertain clinical importance.\n\nConclusions: Despite previous published findings, our results show immobilization in external rotation did not confer a significant benefit versus sling immobilization in the prevention of recurrent instability after primary anterior shoulder dislocation. Further studies with larger numbers may elucidate whether functional outcomes, compliance, or comfort with immobilization can be improved with this device.",

Intraoperative data including tear size, repair configuration, \nand concomitant procedures were recorded. Follow-up examination was performed at \nregular intervals up to 2 years. Preoperative imaging was reviewed to classify \nthe acromial morphologic type, acromial angle, and lateral acromial angulation.\nRESULTS: A total of 114 patients were initially enrolled in the study, and 95 \n(83%; 43 nonacromioplasty, 52 acromioplasty) were available for a minimum 2-year \nfollow-up. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics, \nincluding number of tendons torn, repair configuration, concomitant procedures, \nand acromion type and angles. There were no significant differences in functional \noutcomes between nonacromioplasty and acromioplasty groups at any time point.\nCONCLUSION: Acromioplasty was not more effective than nonacromioplasty in \npatients undergoing arthroscopic repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears.",

The Simple \nShoulder Test (SST), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, Constant \nscore, University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) score, and Short Form-12 \n(SF-12) health assessment were collected along with physical examination \nincluding range of motion and dynamometer strength testing. Intraoperative data \nincluding tear size, repair configuration, and concomitant procedures were \nrecorded. Follow-up examination was performed at regular intervals up to 2 \nyears. Preoperative imaging was reviewed to classify the acromial morphologic \ntype, acromial angle, and lateral acromial angulation.\nRESULTS: A total of 114 patients were initially enrolled in the study, and 95 \n(83%; 43 nonacromioplasty, 52 acromioplasty) were available for a minimum 2-year \nfollow-up. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics, \nincluding number of tendons torn, repair configuration, concomitant procedures, \nand acromion type and angles. Within groups, there was a significant (P < .001) \nimprovement in all functional outcome scores from preoperatively to all \nfollow-up time points, including 2 years, for the nonacromioplasty and \nacromioplasty groups (ASES score: 55.1-91.5, 48.8-89.0; Constant score: \n48.3-75.0, 51.9-78.7, respectively). There were no significant differences in \nfunctional outcomes between nonacromioplasty and acromioplasty groups or between \nsubjects with different acromial features at any time point.\nCONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrate no difference in clinical \noutcomes after rotator cuff repair with or without acromioplasty at 2 years \npostoperatively.",

Eligible patients with \nED nausea and vomiting were randomized to receive 4 mg intravenous ondansetron, \n20 mg intravenous metoclopramide, or saline solution placebo. Primary outcome \nwas mean change in visual analog scale (VAS) rating of nausea severity from \nenrollment to 30 minutes after study drug administration. Secondary outcomes \nincluded patient satisfaction, need for rescue antiemetic treatment, and adverse \nevents.\nRESULTS: Of 270 recruited patients, 258 (95.6%) were available for analysis. Of \nthese patients, 87 (33.7%) received ondansetron; 88 (34.1%), metoclopramide; and \n83 (32.2%), placebo. Baseline characteristics between treatment groups and \nrecruitment site were similar. Mean decrease in VAS score was 27 mm (95% \nconfidence interval [CI] 22 to 33 mm) for ondansetron, 28 mm (95% CI 22 to 34 \nmm) for metoclopramide, and 23 mm (95% CI 16 to 30 mm) for placebo. Satisfaction \nwith treatment was reported by 54.1% (95% CI 43.5% to 64.5%), 61.6% (95% CI \n51.0% to 71.4%), and 59.5% (95% CI 48.4% to 69.9%) for ondansetron, \nmetoclopramide, and placebo, respectively; rescue medication was required by \n34.5% (95% CI 25.0% to 45.1%), 17.9% (95% CI 10.8% to 27.2%), and 36.3% (95% CI \n26.3% to 47.2%), respectively. Nine minor adverse events were reported.\nCONCLUSION: Reductions in nausea severity for this adult ED nausea and vomiting \npopulation were similar for 4 mg intravenous ondansetron, 20 mg intravenous \nmetoclopramide, and placebo. There was a trend toward greater reductions in VAS \nratings and a lesser requirement for rescue medication in the antiemetic drug \ngroups, but differences from the placebo group did not reach significance. The \nmajority of patients in all groups were satisfied with treatment.",

Forty-six patients scheduled for TKA were randomized into two groups: concomitant administration of FNB and SNB or FNB and LIA. Average pain scores during the first 21days after surgery were similar in the two groups and remained at low level. There was no significant difference in the need for adjuvant analgesics, patient satisfaction level, the time to achieve rehabilitation goals, and length of hospital stay. The LIA offers a potentially safer alternative to SNB as an adjunct to FNB.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of different loads of knee extensor open \nkinetic chain resistance training on anterior knee laxity and function in the \nACL-injured (ACLI) knee.\nMETHODS: Fifty-eight ACLI subjects were randomised to one of three (12-week \nduration) training groups. The STAND group trained according to a standardised \nrehabilitation protocol. Subjects in the LOW and HIGH group trained as did the \nSTAND group but with the addition of seated knee extensor open kinetic chain \nresistance training at loads of 2 sets of 20 repetition maximum (RM) and 20 sets \nof 2RM, respectively. Anterior knee laxity and measurements of physical and \nsubjective function were performed at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks. Thirty-six \nsubjects were tested at both baseline and 12 weeks (STAND n = 13, LOW n = 11, \nHIGH n = 12).\nRESULTS: The LOW group demonstrated a reduction in 133 N anterior knee laxity \nbetween baseline and 12 weeks testing when compared to the HIGH and the STAND \ngroups (p = 0.009). Specifically, the trained-untrained knee laxity decreased an \naverage of approximately 5 mm in the LOW group while remaining the same in the \nother two groups.\nCONCLUSION: Twelve weeks of knee extensor open kinetic chain resistance training \nat loads of 2 sets of 20RM led to a reduction in anterior knee laxity in the \nACLI knee. This reduction in laxity does not appear to offer any significant \nshort-term functional advantages when compared to a standard rehabilitation \nprotocol. These results indicate that knee laxity can be decreased with \nresistance training of the thigh muscles.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency technology for shoulder instability was rapidly \nadopted despite limited clinical evidence and a poor understanding of its \nindications. Reports of serious adverse events followed, leading to its \nabandonment. This paper presents findings from a multicenter randomized clinical \ntrial evaluating the safety and efficacy of electrothermal arthroscopic \ncapsulorrhaphy (ETAC) compared with open inferior capsular shift (ICS).\nMETHODS: Patients (>14 years) diagnosed with multidirectional instability or \nmultidirectional laxity with anteroinferior instability and failed nonoperative \ntreatment were enrolled. Patients with bone lesions or labral, biceps anchor, or \nfull-thickness rotator cuff tears were excluded intraoperatively. The primary \noutcome was the Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index at 2 years \npostoperatively. Secondary outcomes included American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons \nscore, Constant score, active range of motion, recurrent instability, and \nsurgical times.\nRESULTS: Fifty-four subjects (mean age, 23 years; 37 women) were randomized to \nETAC (n = 28) or open ICS (n = 26). The groups were comparable at baseline, \nexcept for external rotation at the side. At 2 years postoperatively, there were \nno statistically significant differences between groups for the Western Ontario \nShoulder Instability Index (P = .71), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score \n(P = .43), Constant score (P = .43), and active range of motion. Recurrent \ninstability was not statistically different (ETAC, 2; open, 4; P = .41). ETAC \n(23 minutes) was significantly shorter than open ICS (59 minutes) (P < .01) \nsurgery. Three subjects (1 ETAC, 2 open) had stiff shoulders.\nCONCLUSIONS: ETAC was not more effective on the Western Ontario Shoulder \nInstability Index than open ICS in patients with multidirectional shoulder \ninstability.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency technology for shoulder instability was rapidly \nadopted despite limited clinical evidence and a poor understanding of its \nindications. Reports of serious adverse events followed, leading to its \nabandonment. This paper presents findings from a multicenter randomized clinical \ntrial evaluating the safety and efficacy of electrothermal arthroscopic \ncapsulorrhaphy (ETAC) compared with open inferior capsular shift (ICS) and \nreviews the role of randomized trials in adopting new technology.\nMETHODS: Patients (>14\u0412\u00a0years) diagnosed with multidirectional instability or \nmultidirectional laxity with anteroinferior instability and failed nonoperative \ntreatment were enrolled. Patients with bone lesions or labral, biceps anchor, or \nfull-thickness rotator cuff tears were excluded intraoperatively. Outcomes \nincluded Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index, function and recurrent \ninstability at 2 years postoperatively, and surgical times.\nRESULTS: Fifty-four subjects (mean age, 23\u0412\u00a0years; 37 women) were randomized to \nETAC (n\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a028) or open ICS (n\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a026). The groups were comparable at baseline, \nexcept for external rotation at the side. At 2 years postoperatively, there were \nno statistically or clinically significant differences between groups for the \nWestern Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (P\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a0.71), American Shoulder and \nElbow Surgeons score (P\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a0.43), Constant score (P\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a0.43), and active range of \nmotion. Recurrent instability was not statistically different (ETAC,\u0412\u00a02; open,\u0412\u00a04; \nP\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a0.41). ETAC (23\u0412\u00a0minutes) was significantly shorter than open ICS (59\u0412\u00a0minutes) \n(P\u0412\u00a0<\u0412\u00a0.01) surgery. Three subjects (1 ETAC, 2 open) had stiff shoulders.\nCONCLUSIONS: At 2 years postoperatively, quality of life and functional outcomes \nbetween groups were not clinically different. ETAC had fewer complications and \nepisodes of recurrence compared with open surgery. This evidence reinforces the \nneed to critically evaluate new technology before widespread clinical use.",

In the TENS group, electrical \nstimulation of the common fibular nerve, which produced a brisk dorsiflexion of \nthe ankle, was performed for the operated leg during surgery. In the control \ngroup, no electrical stimulation was applied. The primary outcome was the incidence of DVT assessed by ultrasonography on post-operative day (POD) 1. Secondary outcomes included serum D-dimer and soluble fibrin monomer complex (SFMC) levels measured before surgery, immediately after surgery, and POD 1.\nRESULTS: The incidence of DVT was 11% (5/45 cases) in the TENS group and 31% (14/45 cases) in the control group (p = 0.02). Immediately after surgery, D-dimer and SFMC levels were lower in the TENS group compared with control (p < 0.05). There were no adverse effects related to TENS.\nCONCLUSIONS: TENS was more effective than no intervention in preventing DVT in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.",

However, the effect of navigation compared with intraoperative \nfluoroscopy is unclear.\nQUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether intraoperative use of imageless navigation \n(1) improves the relative accuracy of leg length and global and femoral offset \nrestoration; (2) increases the absolute precision of leg length and global and \nfemoral offset equalization; and (3) reduces outliers in a reconstruction zone \nof \u0412\u00b1 5 mm for leg length and global and femoral offset restoration compared with \nintraoperative fluoroscopy during minimally invasive (MIS) THA with the patient \nin a lateral decubitus position.\nMETHODS: In this prospective study a consecutive series of 125 patients were \nrandomized to either navigation-guided or fluoroscopy-controlled THA using \nsealed, opaque envelopes. All patients received the same cementless prosthetic \ncomponents through an anterolateral MIS approach while they were in a lateral \ndecubitus position. Leg length, global or total offset (representing the \ncombination of femoral and acetabular offset), and femoral offset differences \nwere restored using either navigation or fluoroscopy. Postoperatively, residual \nleg length and global and femoral offset discrepancies were analyzed on \nmagnification-corrected radiographs of the pelvis by an independent and blinded \nexaminer using digital planning software. Accuracy was defined as the relative \npostoperative difference between the surgically treated and the unaffected \ncontralateral side for leg length and offset, respectively; precision was \ndefined as the absolute postoperative deviation of leg length and global and \nfemoral offset regardless of lengthening or shortening of leg length and offset \nthroughout the THA. All analyses were performed per intention-to-treat.\nRESULTS: Analyzing the relative accuracy of leg length restoration we found a \nmean difference of 0.2 mm (95% CI, -1.0 to +1.4 mm; p = 0.729) between \nfluoroscopy and navigation, 0.2 mm (95 % CI, -0.9 to +1.3 mm; p = 0.740) for \nglobal offset and 1.7 mm (95 % CI, +0.4 to +2.9 mm; p = 0.008) for femoral \noffset. For the absolute precision of leg length and global and femoral offset \nequalization, there was a mean difference of 1.7 \u0412\u00b1 0.3 mm (p < 0.001) between \nfluoroscopy and navigation. The biomechanical reconstruction with a residual leg \nlength and global and femoral offset discrepancy less than 5 mm and less than 8 \nmm, respectively, succeeded in 93% and 98%, respectively, in the navigation \ngroup and in 54% and 95%, respectively, in the fluoroscopy group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative fluoroscopy and imageless navigation seem equivalent \nin accuracy and precision to reconstruct leg length and global and femoral \noffset during MIS THA with the patient in the lateral decubitus position.",

        "abstract": "Objective\nIntravenous morphine has been used as a common method of pain control in emergency care. Nebulized\u0412\u00a0fentanyl\u0412\u00a0is also an effective temporary substitute. This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of nebulized fentanyl with intravenous (IV) morphine on management of acute limb pain.\nMethods\nThis was a placebo-controlled, double-blind\u0412\u00a0randomized clinical trial. Ninety emergency department patients with moderate to severe pain aged 15 to 50 years were blocked randomized and enrolled in this study. Forty-seven patients in the experimental group received nebulized fentanyl (4\u0412\u00a0\u041e\u0458g/kg) and IV normal saline as placebo, and the remaining 43 patients in the control group received IV morphine (0.1 mg/kg) and nebulized normal saline as placebo. All participants' pain scores were assessed by Numerical Rating Scale before and after intervention at 5-, 10-, 15-, 30-, 45-, and 60-minute intervals. Patients' vital sign and possible\u0412\u00a0adverse effects\u0412\u00a0were recorded respectively. Finally, all participants were assessed for their satisfaction.\nResults\nThe mean initial pain score in the experimental group was 8.7 and 8.4 in the control group (P\u0412\u00a0= .1). Pain relief in both groups after 5 and 10 minutes were similar (P\u0412\u00a0= .72). Although the pain relief was significantly greater with fentanyl at 15 minutes, this difference is not clinically significant. Pain management in both groups was successful and was more than 3 scores reduction in Numerical Rating Scale. Patient satisfaction in both groups was similar. No adverse effects were reported in the experimental group.\nConclusion\nThis study suggests that nebulized fentanyl is a rapid, safe, and effective method for temporary control of acute limb pain in emergency department patients.",

        "abstract": "Objective\nIntravenous morphine has been used as a common method of pain control in emergency care. Nebulized fentanyl is also an effective temporary substitute. This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of nebulized fentanyl with intravenous (IV) morphine on management of acute limb pain.\nMethods\nThis was a placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized clinical trial. Ninety emergency department patients with moderate to severe pain aged 15 to 50 years were blocked randomized and enrolled in this study. Forty-seven patients in the experimental group received nebulized fentanyl (4 \u03bcg/kg) and IV normal saline as placebo, and the remaining 43 patients in the control group received IV morphine (0.1 mg/kg) and nebulized normal saline as placebo. The primary outcome was pain relief measured by Numerical Rating Scale. All participants' pain scores were assessed by Numerical Rating Scale before and after intervention at 5-, 10-, 15-, 30-, 45-, and 60-minute intervals. Patients' vital signs and possible adverse effects were recorded respectively. Patient satisfaction was also assessed.\nResults\nThe mean initial pain score in the experimental group was 8.7 and 8.4 in the control group (P = .1). Pain relief in both groups after 5 and 10 minutes were similar (P = .72). Pain relief was significantly greater with fentanyl at 15 minutes, but this difference was not clinically significant. Pain reduction was more than 3 scores in Numerical Rating Scale in both groups. Patient satisfaction in both groups was similar. No adverse effects were reported in the experimental group.\nConclusion\nNebulized fentanyl was not more effective than IV morphine in patients with acute limb pain.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Ankle sprain is a frequently encountered traumatic injury in \nemergency departments and is associated with important health expenses. However, \nthe appropriate care of this traumatic injury remains a matter of debate. We \ntested the hypothesis that compression stockings speed up recovery from ankle \nsprain.\nMETHODS: Recent (<48 hours) cases of ankle sprain without other traumatic injury \nin patients aged between 18 and 55 years were included. Patients were randomly \nallocated to placebo Jersey or class II compression stockings (Venoflex; \nThuasne, Levallois-Perret, France). The primary end point was the time to \nrecovery of normal painless walking without requirement for analgesic drug. \nSecondary end points were time to return to sport activity, pain, analgesic \nconsumption, and ankle edema (bimalleolar and midfoot circumferences).\nRESULTS: We randomized 126 patients and analyzed 117 patients (60 in the placebo \ngroup and 57 in the compression group). The median time to normal painless \nwalking was not significantly decreased (P = .16). No significant differences \nwere observed in pain, analgesic consumption, and bimalleloar and midfoot \ncircumferences. No safety issue was reported. In the subgroup of patients with \nregular sport activity, the time to return to sport activity was shorter in \npatients treated with compression stockings (P = .02).\nCONCLUSIONS: Compression stockings failed to significantly modify the time to \nreturn to normal painless walking in ankle sprain. A beneficial effect was \nobserved only in a subgroup of patients, as compression stockings significantly \ndecreased the time to return to sport activity.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Ankle sprain is a frequently encountered traumatic injury in \nemergency departments and is associated with important health expenses. However, \nthe appropriate care of this traumatic injury remains a matter of debate. We \ntested the hypothesis that compression stockings speed up recovery from ankle \nsprain.\nMETHODS: Recent (<48 hours) cases of ankle sprain without other traumatic injury \nin patients aged between 18 and 55 years were included. Patients were randomly \nallocated to placebo Jersey or class II compression stockings (Venoflex; \nThuasne, Levallois-Perret, France). The primary end point was the time to \nrecovery of normal painless walking without requirement for analgesic drug. \nSecondary end points were time to return to sport activity, pain, analgesic \nconsumption, and ankle edema (bimalleolar and midfoot circumferences).\nRESULTS: We randomized 126 patients and analyzed 117 patients (60 in the placebo \ngroup and 57 in the compression group). The median time to normal painless \nwalking was not significantly decreased (P = .16). No significant differences \nwere observed in pain, analgesic consumption, and bimalleolar and midfoot \ncircumferences. No safety issue was reported.\nCONCLUSIONS: Compression stockings were not more effective than placebo in \nreducing time to recovery of normal painless walking in patients with ankle \nsprain.",

The primary \nendpoint was defined as meeting predetermined discharge eligibility criteria \nwithin 6 hours of study drug administration. Discharge criteria included \nimprovement of edema, stable vital signs, absence of stridor, absence of dyspnea \nor use of accessory muscles during respiration, absence of drooling, and ability \nto drink without difficulty.\nRESULTS: An interim analysis showed that a high percentage of subjects met the \nprimary endpoint, and the study was halted. Overall, 79 subjects were randomized \nand 76 had data for analysis. Most had mild (45%) or moderate (42%) ACEIA. The \ndischarge eligibility endpoint was met by 72% of the placebo group and 85%, 89%, \nand 89% of the ecallantide 10-, 30-, and 60-mg groups, respectively. This \ndifference in meeting discharge eligibility endpoint criteria between treatment \ngroups was not statistically significant. The incidence of treatment-emergent \nadverse events was similar between placebo and active-treatment groups.\nCONCLUSION: The addition of ecallantide to standard therapy does not appear to \nimprove angioedema compared with placebo in ED patients with ACEIA. Our data \nsuggest that most ED patients presenting with mild to moderate ACEIA are likely \nto meet our discharge eligibility criteria within 6 hours of treatment, \nregardless of intervention. Further studies to assess the utility of ecallantide \nin patients with more severe angioedema may be useful. No new safety signals \nrelated to ecallantide administration were identified.",

(DePuy Int, Warsaw, IN, USA) \nhumeral head resurfacing implants (HHRIs).\nMETHODS: The study randomly allocated 32 patients (13 women), mean age 63 years \n(range, 39-82 years), with shoulder osteoarthritis to a Copeland (n = 14) or \nGlobal C.A.P. (n = 18) HHRI. Patients were monitored for 2 years with \nradiostereometry, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, Constant Shoulder Score \n(CSS), and the Western Ontario Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder Index (WOOS). LGHO \nwas measured preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively.\nRESULTS: At 2 years, total translation (TT) was 0.48 mm (standard deviation \n[SD], 0.21 mm) for the Copeland and 0.82 mm (SD, 0.46 mm) for the Global C.A.P. \n(P = .06). Five HHRI were revised, and in the interval before the last follow-up \n(revision or 2 years), TT of 0.58 mm (SD, 0.61 mm) for revised HHRI was higher \n(P = .02) than TT of 0.22 mm (SD, 0.17 mm) in nonrevised HHRI. A comparison of \nTT at the last follow-up (revision or 2 years) found no difference between the \nHHRIs (P = .12). Periprosthetic BMD decreased initially but increased \ncontinuously after 6 months for both HHRIs. At 2 years, BMD was 48% higher \naround the Copeland HHRI (P = .005). The mean difference in LGHO was \nsignificantly higher for the Copeland than for the Global C.A.P. HHRI (P = .02). \nClinical results evaluated with CSS and WOOS improved over time for both implant \ngroups (P < .01), with no differences between the groups.\nCONCLUSION: Both implants had only little migration and good clinical results. \nPeriprosthetic BMD and LGHO both increased for the Copeland HHRI more than for \nthe Global C.A.P HHRI.",

(DePuy Int, Warsaw, IN, USA) \nhumeral head resurfacing implants (HHRIs).\nMETHODS: The study randomly allocated 32 patients (13 women), mean age 63 years \n(range, 39-82 years), with shoulder osteoarthritis to a Copeland (n = 14) or \nGlobal C.A.P. (n = 18) HHRI. The primary outcome was implant migration measured \nby total translation (TT). Secondary outcomes included bone mineral density, \nlength of glenohumeral offset, Constant Shoulder Score (CSS), and the Western \nOntario Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder Index (WOOS). Patients were monitored for \n2 years with radiostereometry, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, CSS, and WOOS. \nLGHO was measured preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively.\nRESULTS: At 2 years, total translation (TT) was 0.48 mm (standard deviation \n[SD], 0.21 mm) for the Copeland and 0.82 mm (SD, 0.46 mm) for the Global C.A.P. \n(P = .06). Five HHRI were revised. Periprosthetic BMD decreased initially but \nincreased continuously after 6 months for both HHRIs. At 2 years, BMD was 48% \nhigher around the Copeland HHRI (P = .005). The mean difference in LGHO was \nsignificantly higher for the Copeland than for the Global C.A.P. HHRI (P = .02). \nClinical results evaluated with CSS and WOOS improved over time for both implant \ngroups (P < .01), with no differences between the groups.\nCONCLUSION: The Copeland HHRI was not more effective than the Global C.A.P. HHRI \non implant migration in patients with shoulder osteoarthritis.",

To test this hypothesis, the clinical effect of the combined treatment with hyaluronic acid injection alone in patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis as compared in this prospective single-blinded randomized trial.\n\nMethods: This study included 70 patients. Group 1 (n = 35) received intraarticular hyaluronic acid injections only, whereas group 2 (n = 35) received intraarticular hyaluronic acid injections combined with a single local injection of corticosteroid-lidocaine. Injections were administered to the most painful areas of the anterior or posterior medial condyle of the femur or tibia. The outcome was measured by independent assessors (blinded to treatment) using a linear VAS pain scale and WOMAC and HSS knee scores. Assessments were performed at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, 12, 26, and 52 weeks.\n\nResults: During the first 3 weeks, group 2 patients showed significantly better all scores than did group 1 patients (p < 0.01). However, no significant differences were detected at 6, 12, 26 or 52 weeks (n.s.).\n\nConclusion: The combined treatment was not more effective than intraarticular hyaluronic acid alone in patients with knee osteoarthritis.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: A local injection of corticosteroid-lidocaine into the periarticular soft tissue structures is used commonly for rapid pain relief. It is hypothesized that knee pain associated with knee osteoarthritis would be relieved quickly and effectively in patients receiving intraarticular hyaluronic acid combined with a periarticular lidocaine-corticosteroid injection. To test this hypothesis, the clinical effect of the combined treatment with hyaluronic acid injection alone in patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis as compared in this prospective single-blinded randomized trial.\n\nMethods: This study included 70 patients. Group 1 (n = 35) received intraarticular hyaluronic acid injections only, whereas group 2 (n = 35) received intraarticular hyaluronic acid injections combined with a single local injection of corticosteroid-lidocaine. Injections were administered to the most painful areas of the anterior or posterior medial condyle of the femur or tibia. The outcome was measured by independent assessors (blinded to treatment) using a linear VAS pain scale and WOMAC and HSS knee scores. Assessments were performed at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, 12, 26, and 52 weeks.\n\nResults: During the first 3 weeks, group 2 patients showed significantly better all scores than did group 1 patients (p < 0.01). However, no significant differences were detected at 6, 12, 26 or 52 weeks (n.s.).\n\nConclusion: The combined treatment may lead to earlier pain relief compared with intraarticular hyaluronic acid alone in patients with knee osteoarthritis and can be considered a useful adjunctive treatment modality. This combined method may provide early return to patient's daily activity.",

This study was completed in 2 large academic \nEDs. Bupivacaine or normal saline solution was delivered intranasally (0.3 mL \nper side) with the Tx360 device. Pain and nausea were measured at 0, 5, and 15 \nminutes by a 100-mm visual analog scale. The primary endpoint was a 50% \nreduction in pain at 15 minutes. Telephone follow-up assessed 24-hour pain and \nnausea through a 0- to 10-point verbal scale and adverse effects.\nRESULTS: The median reported baseline pain in the bupivacaine group was 80 mm \n(IQR 66 mm - 93 mm) and 78.5 mm (IQR 64 mm to 91.75 mm) in the normal saline \nsolution group. A 50% reduction in pain was achieved in 48.8% of the bupivacaine \ngroup (20/41 patients) versus 41.3% in the normal saline solution group (19/46 \npatients), for an absolute risk difference of 7.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] \n-13% to 27.1%). As a secondary outcome, at 24 hours, more patients in the \nbupivacaine group were headache free (24.7% difference; 95% CI 2.6% to 43.6%) \nand more were nausea free (16.9% difference; 95% CI 0.8% to 32.5%).\nCONCLUSION: For patients with acute anterior headache, sphenopalatine ganglion \nblock with the Tx360 device with bupivacaine did not result in a significant \nincrease in the proportion of patients achieving a greater than or equal to 50% \nreduction in headache severity at 15 minutes compared with saline solution \napplied in the same manner.",

This study was completed in 2 large academic \nEDs. Bupivacaine or normal saline solution was delivered intranasally (0.3 mL \nper side) with the Tx360 device. Pain and nausea were measured at 0, 5, and 15 \nminutes by a 100-mm visual analog scale. The primary endpoint was a 50% \nreduction in pain at 15 minutes. Telephone follow-up assessed 24-hour pain and \nnausea through a 0- to 10-point verbal scale and adverse effects.\nRESULTS: The median reported baseline pain in the bupivacaine group was 80 mm \n(IQR 66 mm - 93 mm) and 78.5 mm (IQR 64 mm to 91.75 mm) in the normal saline \nsolution group. A 50% reduction in pain was achieved in 48.8% of the bupivacaine \ngroup (20/41 patients) versus 41.3% in the normal saline solution group (19/46 \npatients), for an absolute risk difference of 7.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] \n-13% to 27.1%). At 24 hours, 24.7% more patients in the bupivacaine group were \nheadache free (95% CI 2.6% to 43.6%) and 16.9% more were nausea free (95% CI \n0.8% to 32.5%).\nCONCLUSION: Sphenopalatine ganglion block with bupivacaine was not more effective \non 50% reduction in pain at 15 minutes than normal saline solution in patients \nwith acute anterior headache.",

All patients had either a full-thickness or \nhigh-grade (>50%) RC tear, ACJ tenderness, arthritic change visible on plain \nradiographs, and a positive ACJ lidocaine injection test the day before surgery. \nPatients were randomized into 2 groups: DCR and RC repair (DCR+RCR group) and RC \nrepair only (isolated RCR). Evaluation was performed preoperatively, at 6 months \npostoperatively, and at a final follow-up a minimum of 24 months postoperatively \nusing the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, the Constant \nshoulder score, range of motion examination, and pain visual analog scale (VAS).\nRESULTS: After simple randomization, 26 shoulders were allocated in the DCR+RCR \ngroup, and 32 were placed in the isolated RCR group.

At \nfinal follow-up, the ASES, Constant, and VAS scores were significantly improved \nin both groups (P < .001). There were no differences in ASES, Constant, and VAS \nscores between the 2 groups at final follow-up (P > .05), and there was no \ndifference in residual ACJ tenderness (7 in the DCR+RCR group and 5 in the \nisolated RCR group) between the 2 groups (P = .270).\nCONCLUSION: There was no difference in the clinical evaluations between the \ncombined arthroscopic DCR and RCR group and the isolated RCR group at a minimum \n24-month follow-up.

A convenience sample of patients aged 18 to 59 years with acute abdominal, flank, low back, or extremity pain were enrolled.

A sample size of 20 subjects per group was calculated based on an 80% power to detect a 2-point change in NRS scores between treatment groups with estimated SDs of 2 and an \u03b1 of .05, using a repeated-measures linear model.\n\nResults: Forty-five subjects were enrolled (MOR 21, LDK 24). Demographic variables and baseline NRS scores (7.1 vs 7.1) were similar. Ketamine was not superior to MOR in the maximum change of NRS pain scores, MOR=5 (confidence interval, 6.6-3.5) and LDK=4.9 (confidence interval, 5.8-4). The time to achieve maximum reduction in NRS pain scores was at 5 minutes for LDK and 100 minutes for MOR.

Earlier transfusion with higher blood product ratios (plasma, platelets, and red blood cells), defined as damage control resuscitation, has been associated with improved outcomes; however, there have been no large multicenter clinical trials.\n\nObjective: To determine the effectiveness and safety of transfusing patients with severe trauma and major bleeding using plasma, platelets, and red blood cells in a 1:1:1 ratio compared with a 1:1:2 ratio.\n\nDesign, setting, and participants: Pragmatic, phase 3, multisite, randomized clinical trial of 680 severely injured patients who arrived at 1 of 12 level I trauma centers in North America directly from the scene and were predicted to require massive transfusion between August 2012 and December 2013.\n\nInterventions: Blood product ratios of 1:1:1 (338 patients) vs 1:1:2 (342 patients) during active resuscitation in addition to all local standard-of-care interventions (uncontrolled).\n\nMain outcomes and measures: Primary outcomes were 24-hour and 30-day all-cause mortality. Prespecified ancillary outcomes included time to hemostasis, blood product volumes transfused, complications, incidence of surgical procedures, and functional status.\n\nResults: No significant differences were detected in mortality at 24 hours (12.7% in 1:1:1 group vs 17.0% in 1:1:2 group; difference, -4.2% [95% CI, -9.6% to 1.1%]; P = .12) or at 30 days (22.4% vs 26.1%, respectively; difference, -3.7% [95% CI, -10.2% to 2.7%]; P = .26). Exsanguination occurred in 9.2% of the 1:1:1 group vs 14.6% in the 1:1:2 group (difference, -5.4% [95% CI, -10.4% to -0.5%]; P = .03). Hemostasis was achieved in 86% of the 1:1:1 group vs 78% in the 1:1:2 group (P = .006). The 1:1:1 group received more plasma (median of 7 U vs 5 U, P < .001) and platelets (12 U vs 6 U, P < .001) and similar amounts of red blood cells (9 U) over the first 24 hours. No differences between the 2 groups were found for the 23 prespecified complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure, venous thromboembolism, sepsis, and transfusion-related complications.\n\nConclusions and relevance: The 1:1:1 ratio was not more effective on 24-hour and 30-day mortality than the 1:1:2 ratio in patients with severe trauma and major bleeding.",

Earlier transfusion with higher blood product ratios (plasma, platelets, and red blood cells), defined as damage control resuscitation, has been associated with improved outcomes; however, there have been no large multicenter clinical trials.\n\nObjective: To determine the effectiveness and safety of transfusing patients with severe trauma and major bleeding using plasma, platelets, and red blood cells in a 1:1:1 ratio compared with a 1:1:2 ratio.\n\nDesign, setting, and participants: Pragmatic, phase 3, multisite, randomized clinical trial of 680 severely injured patients who arrived at 1 of 12 level I trauma centers in North America directly from the scene and were predicted to require massive transfusion between August 2012 and December 2013.\n\nInterventions: Blood product ratios of 1:1:1 (338 patients) vs 1:1:2 (342 patients) during active resuscitation in addition to all local standard-of-care interventions (uncontrolled).\n\nMain outcomes and measures: Primary outcomes were 24-hour and 30-day all-cause mortality. Prespecified ancillary outcomes included time to hemostasis, blood product volumes transfused, complications, incidence of surgical procedures, and functional status.\n\nResults: No significant differences were detected in mortality at 24 hours (12.7% in 1:1:1 group vs 17.0% in 1:1:2 group; difference, -4.2% [95% CI, -9.6% to 1.1%]; P = .12) or at 30 days (22.4% vs 26.1%, respectively; difference, -3.7% [95% CI, -10.2% to 2.7%]; P = .26). Exsanguination, which was the predominant cause of death within the first 24 hours, was significantly decreased in the 1:1:1 group (9.2% vs 14.6% in 1:1:2 group; difference, -5.4% [95% CI, -10.4% to -0.5%]; P = .03). More patients in the 1:1:1 group achieved hemostasis than in the 1:1:2 group (86% vs 78%, respectively; P = .006). Despite the 1:1:1 group receiving more plasma (median of 7 U vs 5 U, P < .001) and platelets (12 U vs 6 U, P < .001) and similar amounts of red blood cells (9 U) over the first 24 hours, no differences between the 2 groups were found for the 23 prespecified complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure, venous thromboembolism, sepsis, and transfusion-related complications.\n\nConclusions and relevance: Among patients with severe trauma and major bleeding, early administration of plasma, platelets, and red blood cells in a 1:1:1 ratio compared with a 1:1:2 ratio did not result in significant differences in mortality at 24 hours or at 30 days. However, more patients in the 1:1:1 group achieved hemostasis and fewer experienced death due to exsanguination by 24 hours. Even though there was an increased use of plasma and platelets transfused in the 1:1:1 group, no other safety differences were identified between the 2 groups.",

A loading dose was initiated by paramedics before the patient arrived at the hospital, and a 24-hour maintenance infusion was started on the patient's arrival at the hospital.

        "abstract": "Background:\u0412\u00a0Component alignment can influence implant longevity as well as perhaps pain and function after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), but correct alignment is not consistently achieved. To increase the likelihood that good alignment will be achieved during surgery, smart tools such as robotics or patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) have been introduced.\nQuestions/purposes:\u0412\u00a0We hypothesized that UKA performed with PSI would result in improved level gait as ascertained with three-dimensional analysis, implant positioning, and patient-reported outcomes measured by a validated scoring system when compared with conventional instrumentation 3 months and 1 year after surgery.\nMethods:\u0412\u00a0We randomized 60 patients into two groups using either the PSI technique or a conventional technique. All patients were operated on using the same technique and the same cemented metal-backed implant. Mean age of the patients was 63 \u0412\u00b1 4 years (range, 54-72 years) and mean body mass index was 28 \u0412\u00b1 3 kg/m(2). Patients were evaluated preoperatively, at 3 months, and 1 year after surgery by an independent observer blind to the type of technique. Gait parameters were assessed with three-dimensional analysis during level walking preoperatively and at 1 year, frontal and sagittal position of the implant was evaluated on full-length radiographs at 3 months, and subjective functional outcome and quality of life using routine questionnaires (SF-12, new Knee Society Score [KSS], Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) at 3 months and 1 year. This study had 80% power to detect a 15% difference in walking speed at the p < 0.05 level.\nResults:\u0412\u00a0One year after surgery, there were no differences between the two groups in the analyzed gait spatiotemporal parameters, respectively, for PSI UKA and conventional UKA : double limb support 31% (25%-54%) versus 30% (23%-56%; p = 0.67) and walking speed (1.59 m/s [0.86-1.87 m/s] versus 1.57 m/s [0.71-1.96 m/s]; p = 0.41). No difference was observed between the two groups in terms of lower limb alignment (PSI group 178\u0412\u00b0 \u0412\u00b1 3\u0412\u00b0, conventional group 178\u0412\u00b0 \u0412\u00b1 4\u0412\u00b0; p = 0.24) or implant positioning on mediolateral and anteroposterior radiographs. There were no differences in the functional score between the PSI and conventional TKA groups at 3 months and 1 year after surgery: KSS objective knee scores (PSI: 85 \u0412\u00b1 8 points at 3 months, 87 \u0412\u00b1 5 points at 1 year and conventional instrumentation: 82 \u0412\u00b1 8 points at 3 months 83 \u0412\u00b1 6 points at 1 year; p = 0.10) and functional activity scores were similar in both group (PSI: 71 \u0412\u00b1 12 points at 3 months and 74 \u0412\u00b1 7 points at 1 year versus conventional group: 73 \u0412\u00b1 11 points at 3 months and 75 \u0412\u00b1 6 at 1 year; p = 0.9).\nConclusions:\u0412\u00a0Our observations suggest that PSI may confer small, if any, advantage in alignment, pain, or function after UKA. This argument can therefore not be used to justify the extra cost and uncertainty related to this technique.",

This trial was performed to assess the feasibility and safety of \ncontrolled resuscitation (CR) versus standard resuscitation (SR) in hypotensive \ntrauma patients.\nMETHODS: Patients were enrolled and randomized in the out-of-hospital setting. \nNineteen emergency medical services (EMS) systems in the Resuscitation Outcome \nConsortium participated. Eligible patients had an out-of-hospital systolic blood \npressure (SBP) of 90 mm Hg or lower. CR patients received 250 mL of fluid if \nthey had no radial pulse or an SBP lower than 70 mm Hg and additional 250-mL \nboluses to maintain a radial pulse or an SBP of 70 mm Hg or greater. The SR \ngroup patients received 2 L initially and additional fluid as needed to maintain \nan SBP of 110 mm Hg or greater. The crystalloid protocol was maintained until \nhemorrhage control or 2 hours after hospital arrival.\nRESULTS: A total of 192 patients were randomized (97 CR and 95 SR). The CR and \nSR groups were similar at baseline.

This trial was performed to assess the feasibility and safety of \ncontrolled resuscitation (CR) versus standard resuscitation (SR) in hypotensive \ntrauma patients.\nMETHODS: Patients were enrolled and randomized in the out-of-hospital setting. \nNineteen emergency medical services (EMS) systems in the Resuscitation Outcome \nConsortium participated. Eligible patients had an out-of-hospital systolic blood \npressure (SBP) of 90 mm Hg or lower. CR patients received 250 mL of fluid if \nthey had no radial pulse or an SBP lower than 70 mm Hg and additional 250-mL \nboluses to maintain a radial pulse or an SBP of 70 mm Hg or greater. The SR \ngroup patients received 2 L initially and additional fluid as needed to maintain \nan SBP of 110 mm Hg or greater. The crystalloid protocol was maintained until \nhemorrhage control or 2 hours after hospital arrival.\nRESULTS: A total of 192 patients were randomized (97 CR and 95 SR). The CR and \nSR groups were similar at baseline. The mean (SD) crystalloid volume \nadministered during the study period was 1.0 L (1.5) in the CR group and 2.0 L \n(1.4) in the SR group, a difference of 1.0 L (95% confidence interval [CI], \n0.6-1.4). Intensive care unit-free days, ventilator-free days, renal injury, and \nrenal failure did not differ between the groups. At 24 hours after admission, \nthere were 5 deaths (5%) in the CR group and 14 (15%) in the SR group (adjusted \nodds ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.12-1.26). Among patients with blunt trauma, 24-hour \nmortality was 3% (CR) and 18% (SR) with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.17 \n(0.03-0.92). There was no difference among patients with penetrating trauma (9% \nvs. 9%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.93; 95% CI, 0.19-19.17).\nCONCLUSION: CR is achievable in out-of-hospital and hospital settings and may \noffer an early survival advantage in blunt trauma. A large-scale, Phase III \ntrial to examine its effects on survival and other clinical outcomes is \nwarranted.",

There was no difference in the \nincidence of rescue fentanyl analgesia at 30 or 60 minutes. No statistically \nsignificant or clinically concerning changes in vital signs were observed. No \nserious adverse events occurred in either group. Patients in the ketamine group \nreported increased minor adverse effects at 15 minutes post-drug administration.\nCONCLUSION: Subdissociative intravenous ketamine administered at 0.3 mg/kg \nprovides analgesic effectiveness and apparent safety comparable to that of \nintravenous morphine for short-term treatment of acute pain in the ED.",

The primary outcome was time to healing. The treatment \nperiod was up to 4 weeks.\nRESULTS: There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups \nwith respect to the primary end point of time to healing, which occurred in 56 \n(79%) of 71 patients after a median follow-up time of 15 days in the Mepilex Ag \ngroup compared with 65 (79%) of 82 patients after a median follow-up time of 16 \ndays in the SSD group (p = 0.74). There was also no significant difference in \nthe percentage of study burn healed. Patients in the Mepilex Ag group had 87.1% \nof their study burn healed (out of the total burn area) compared with 85.2% of \npatients in the SSD group. The mean total number of dressings used was \nsignificantly more in the SSD group (14.0) compared with the Mepilex Ag group \n(3.06, p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in the time until skin \ngraft was performed between the two study groups. Both products were well tolerated.\nCONCLUSION: Mepilex Ag was not more effective on time to healing than SSD in patients with deep partial-thickness thermal burn injuries.",

Nurses were \nguided by the intervention to initiate additional tests for high-risk children. \nThe clinical decision model was evaluated by 1) \narea-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic-curve (AUC) to indicate \ndiscriminative ability and 2) feasibility, to measure nurses' compliance to \nmodel recommendations. Primary patient outcome was defined as correct SBI \ndiagnoses. Secondary process outcomes were defined as length of stay; diagnostic \ntests; antibiotic treatment; hospital admission; revisits and medical costs.\nRESULTS: The decision model had good discriminative ability for both pneumonia \n(n = 33; AUC 0.83 (95% CI 0.75-0.90)) and other SBI (n = 22; AUC 0.81 (95% CI \n0.72-0.90)). Compliance to model recommendations was high (86%). No differences \nin correct SBI determination were observed. Application of the clinical decision \nmodel resulted in less full-blood-counts (14% vs. 22%, p-value < 0.05) and more \nurine-dipstick testing (71% vs. 61%, p-value < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: In contrast to our expectations no substantial impact on patient \noutcome was perceived. The clinical decision model preserved, however, good \ndiscriminatory ability to detect SBI, achieved good compliance among nurses and \nresulted in a more standardized diagnostic approach towards febrile children, \nwith less full blood-counts and more rightfully urine-dipstick testing.",

A significant difference (P=.042) between the MB-TKA inserts was found in KSS function scores, but clinical significance is expected to be limited. Goniometry, temporal gait parameters and QoL were similar in all groups. Survival was significantly better (P=.047) for FB-TKA.

A prospective single blinded randomised controlled clinical trial was performed to evaluate 2 types of MB-TKA inserts and 2 types of FB-TKA inserts of the Genesis II prosthesis (Smith & Nephew) in 146 patients with 5-years follow-up. A difference (P=.042) between the MB-TKA inserts was found in KSS function scores. Goniometry, temporal gait parameters and QoL were similar in all groups. Survival was different (P=.047) for FB-TKA with higher revision rate in MB-TKA. The study found differences between insert types in KSS function scores and survival rates, with higher revision rates observed in MB-TKA compared to FB-TKA for the Genesis II implant system.",

Recent studies have \ndescribed a positive effect of lateralization of the center of rotation, \nespecially on postoperative rotational function. The goal of this study is to \ncompare the outcome of non-lateralized versus lateralized RSA with particular \nregard to rotational function in patients with CTA.\nMETHODS: Thirty-four patients underwent implantation of RSA either with \nlateralization (n\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a017) or without lateralization (n\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a017) by use of a 1-cm \nautologous bone graft (\"bony increased offset\") of the humeral head for CTA. \nClinical outcomes were measured with the Constant score; the Disabilities of the \nArm, Shoulder and Hand score; and the Activities of Daily Living \nRequiring\u0412\u00a0External Rotation score, as well as measurement of external rotation \nand determination of the external rotation lag sign with the arm at the side and \nat 90\u0412\u00b0 of abduction, at 1 year postoperatively and at final follow-up. Computed \ntomography scan evaluation was performed in all patients preoperatively and at 1 \nyear postoperatively to assess preoperative fatty infiltration of the rotator \ncuff and bony integration of the graft postoperatively.\nRESULTS: At final follow-up, all patients showed significantly increased \nfunctional results. There were no significant differences in the evaluated \nparameters. If patients with degenerative changes of the teres minor were \nexcluded, the lateralized group showed significantly increased external \nrotation. Bony integration of the graft could be verified on postoperative \ncomputed tomography scans in all patients.\nCONCLUSION: RSA with bony lateralization shows a trend toward improved external \nrotation in lateralized RSA, with a statistically significant improvement in \nexternal rotation in patients with an intact teres minor.",

It also \nevaluates the need for additional doses of analgesics in the first 24 hours of \ndischarge from emergency department (ED).\nMETHODS: Adult (>18 years old) patients with soft tissue injuries were enrolled \nin a teaching urban ED. Subjects were randomly allocated to receive a single \ndose of oral oxycodone (5 mg) or oral naproxen (250 mg). Pain scores and drugs' \nadverse effects were assessed before, 30 minutes, and 60 minutes after \nmedication.\nOUTCOME: efficacy in pain control (reduction in pain scale >2 points) and safety \n(rate of side effects). The need for additional pain medication after discharge \nwas assessed by follow-up phone call 24 hours after discharge.\nRESULTS: A total of 150 patients were enrolled. Pain scores were similar in \noxycodone vs naproxen groups before (6.21 \u0412\u00b1 0.9 in vs 6.0 \u0412\u00b1 1.0), 30 minutes \n(4.5 \u0412\u00b1 1.4 vs 4.4 \u0412\u00b1 1.2), and 60 minutes (2.5 \u0412\u00b1 1.3 in vs 2.6 \u0412\u00b1 1.3) after \nmedication, respectively. Twelve (16.0%) patients in oral oxycodone group and 5 \n(6.6%) patients in naproxen group needed more analgesics in first 24 hours after \nED discharge. Adverse effects were more common in oxycodone group (statistically \nsignificant difference). The most common adverse effects in oxycodone group were \nnausea, (13.3%); vomiting, (8.0%); dizziness, (5.3%); drowsiness, 3 (4.0%); and \npruritis, (2.7%).\nCONCLUSION: Oral oxycodone is as effective as naproxen in soft tissue injury \npain control but has a less favorable safety profile.",

The primary \noutcomes were stone expulsion on CT at 28 days and time to stone expulsion. \nSecondary outcomes included urologic interventions, time to self-reported stone \npassage, pain, and analgesia requirements.\nRESULTS: There were 403 patients randomized, 81.4% were men, and the median age \nwas 46 years. The median stone size was 4.0 mm in the tamsulosin group and 3.7 \nmm in the placebo group. Of 316 patients who received CT at 28 days, stone \npassage occurred in 140 of 161 (87.0%) in the tamsulosin group and 127 of 155 \n(81.9%) with placebo, a difference of 5.0% (95% confidence interval -3.0% to \n13.0%).

Patients \nwere allocated to 0.4 mg of tamsulosin or placebo daily for 28 days. The primary \noutcomes were stone expulsion on CT at 28 days and time to stone expulsion.\nRESULTS: There were 403 patients randomized, 81.4% were men, and the median age \nwas 46 years. The median stone size was 4.0 mm in the tamsulosin group and 3.7 \nmm in the placebo group. Of 316 patients who received CT at 28 days, stone \npassage occurred in 140 of 161 (87.0%) in the tamsulosin group and 127 of 155 \n(81.9%) with placebo, a difference of 5.0% (95% confidence interval -3.0% to \n13.0%). In a prespecified subgroup analysis of large stones (5 to 10 mm), 30 of \n36 (83.3%) tamsulosin participants had stone passage compared with 25 of 41 \n(61.0%) with placebo, a difference of 22.4% (95% confidence interval 3.1% to \n41.6%) and number needed to treat of 4.5. There was no difference in urologic \ninterventions, time to self-reported stone passage, pain, or analgesia \nrequirements. Adverse events were generally mild and did not differ between \ngroups.\nCONCLUSION: We found no benefit overall of 0.4 mg of tamsulosin daily for \npatients with distal ureteric calculi less than or equal to 10 mm in terms of \nspontaneous passage, time to stone passage, pain, or analgesia requirements. In \nthe subgroup with large stones (5 to 10 mm), tamsulosin did increase passage and \nshould be considered.",

The rate of pulmonary edema/CHF in the first 48h was \n7.9% (59/830) and was more common among ALB treated subjects (RR = 10.7, CI95 \n4.3-26.6); this complication was expected and was satisfactorily managed with \nmandated diuretic administration and intravenous fluid guidelines. Troponin \nelevations in the first 48h were common, occurring without ECG change or cardiac \nsymptoms in 52 subjects (12.5%).\nCONCLUSIONS: ALB therapy was associated with an increase in symptomatic ICH and \npulmonary edema/congestive heart failure but this did not affect final outcomes. \nTroponin elevation occurs routinely in the first 48 hours after acute ischemic \nstroke.",

A total of 148 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either zolpidem or placebo for 2 weeks. VAS pain scores (rest, ambulation and night), range of motion (ROM), total amount of opioid analgesics and antiemetics taken, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), sleep efficacy and satisfaction were recorded. It was found that patients taking zolpidem achieved greater improvement in quality of life and reported better satisfaction. Patients in the intervention group had lower pain score and took less antiemetics. Moreover, a significant correlation between sleep quality and ROM was detected. These results demonstrated that improved sleep quality is beneficial to patients' post-TKA recovery.",

A total of 148 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either zolpidem or placebo for 2 weeks. VAS pain scores (rest, ambulation and night), range of motion (ROM), total amount of opioid analgesics and antiemetics taken, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), sleep efficacy and satisfaction were recorded. Patients taking zolpidem achieved greater improvement in quality of life and reported better satisfaction. Patients in the intervention group had lower pain score and took less antiemetics. A correlation between sleep quality and ROM was detected. The primary outcome was not clearly specified, making it difficult to determine if zolpidem was more effective than placebo in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.",

While most arthroscopic hip procedures are \nperformed as outpatient surgeries, patients can still experience significant \npostoperative pain and opioid-associated side effects.\nPURPOSE: The potential benefits of a preoperative femoral nerve block (FNB) in \nhip arthroscopy were explored in a previous retrospective review. The study \nobjective was to confirm these findings in a prospective randomized study.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\nMETHODS: Fifty patients undergoing hip arthroscopy were included in this \nprospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial that was patient-, \noperator-, and assessor-blinded. Patients received either a preoperative \nultrasound-guided FNB with 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine (FNB group) or normal \nsaline (control group). Nerve blockade was confirmed via standardized sensory \ntesting before the induction of general anesthesia. The primary endpoint was \ncumulative consumption of oral morphine equivalent at 24 hours after discharge. \nSecondary endpoints included opioid use at various time points, pain scores, \nQuality of Recovery (QoR-27) score, incidence of nausea and vomiting, time to \ndischarge, block-related complications, falls at 24 hours, and patient \nsatisfaction.\nRESULTS: Fifty patients completed the study, including 27 in the FNB group and \n23 in the control group. Most patient characteristics were statistically similar \nbetween groups except for operative time, which was longer in the control group. \nCumulative oral morphine consumption was lower in the FNB group at 48 hours; \nthere was no difference at 24 hours or 7 days postoperatively. Pain scores were \nsignificantly lower up to 6 hours postoperatively in the FNB group compared with \ncontrol; however, rebound pain was observed at 24 hours after discharge in \npatients who received FNB. There was no difference in most secondary outcomes. \nImportantly, a total of 6 patients in the FNB group reported falls (without \ninjury) within the first 24 hours postoperatively compared with none in the \ncontrol group. Patient satisfaction with pain control was high in both groups at \nall time points.\nCONCLUSION: Preoperative FNB may improve early pain control after hip \narthroscopy. However, given the observed risk of falls, the routine use of FNB \nfor outpatient hip arthroscopy cannot be recommended.",

This study investigates the \nefficacy of Rhinochill, an intranasal cooling device over Blanketrol, a surface \ncooling device in inducing TH in cardiac arrest patients within the cardiac \ncatheter laboratory.\nMETHODS: 70 patients were randomized to TH induction with either Rhinochill or \nBlanketrol.

        "abstract": "Background: Olecranon bursitis might be a minor problem in the outpatient clinic but relatively be common to occur. However, there are few well-designed studies comparing approaches to treatment.\n\nQuestions/purposes: (1) Which treatment (compression bandaging with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], aspiration, or aspiration with steroid injections) is associated with the highest likelihood of resolution of nonseptic olecranon bursitis? (2) Which treatment is associated with earliest resolution of symptoms? (3) What factors are associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks?\n\nMethods: We enrolled 133 patients from two centers; after applying prespecified exclusions (septic bursitis or concomitant inflammatory arthritis, intraarticular elbow pathology, recent aspiration or steroid injection done elsewhere, and refusal to participate), 90 patients were randomly allocated to receive compression bandaging with NSAIDs (C), aspiration (A), or aspiration with steroid injection (AS) groups (30 patients in each). The groups were similar at baseline in terms of age and gender. Seven patients (four from Group A and three from Group AS) were lost to followup. All patients were followed up weekly for 4 weeks, and the same treatment procedure was repeated if the bursitis recurred with any substantial fluid collection. At 4 weeks, the state of resolution and pain visual analog scale (VAS) were evaluated. Failed resolution was defined as presence of persistent olecranon bursal fluid collection at Week 4 after the initiation of the treatment; on the contrary, if bursal fluid collection was clinically reduced or completely disappeared by the end of Week 4, the treatment was considered successful. We compared the proportion of resolution by Week 4 and the median times to resolution among the treatment groups. In addition, we evaluated whether the resolution affected pain VAS and what factors were associated with the resolution.\n\nResults: There were no differences in the proportion of patients whose bursitis resolved by Week 4 among the three treatment groups (Group C: 25 of 30 [83%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.27-1.72], p = 0.580; Group A: 17 of 26 [65%], relative risk of resolution failure: 2.19 [95% CI, 0.98-4.87], p = 0.083; Group AS: 23 of 27 [85%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.59 [95% CI, 0.22-1.63], p = 0.398) (p = 0.073). Steroid injection after aspiration (Group AS) was associated with the earliest resolution (2.3 weeks [range, 1-4 weeks]) when compared with aspiration alone (Group A; 3.1 weeks [range, 2-4 weeks]) and compression bandaging with NSAIDs (Group C; 3.2 weeks [range, 2-4 weeks]), p = 0.015). Longer duration of symptoms before treatment was the only factor associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks (failed resolution: 6 weeks [range, 2-9 weeks]; successful resolution: 4 weeks [range, 0.4-6 weeks]; p = 0.008).\n\nConclusions: With the numbers available, there were no differences in efficacy when compression bandaging with NSAIDs, aspiration, and aspiration with steroid injection were compared. However, we were powered only to detect a 30% difference, meaning that if there were a smaller difference in efficacy among the groups, we might not have detected it in a study of this size. Our data can be used as pilot data to power future prospective (and likely multicenter) trials. Because olecranon bursitis can recur, and because treatments like aspiration and aspiration with steroid injection can cause complications, unless future trials demonstrate clear efficacy advantages of aspiration and/or injection both at short and longer terms, we suggest that compression bandaging and a short course of NSAIDs may offer the most appropriate balance of safety and efficacy.",

        "abstract": "Background: Olecranon bursitis might be a minor problem in the outpatient clinic but relatively be common to occur. However, there are few well-designed studies comparing approaches to treatment.\n\nQuestions/purposes: (1) Which treatment (compression bandaging with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], aspiration, or aspiration with steroid injections) is associated with the highest likelihood of resolution of nonseptic olecranon bursitis? (2) Which treatment is associated with earliest resolution of symptoms? (3) What factors are associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks?\n\nMethods: We enrolled 133 patients from two centers; after applying prespecified exclusions (septic bursitis or concomitant inflammatory arthritis, intraarticular elbow pathology, recent aspiration or steroid injection done elsewhere, and refusal to participate), 90 patients were randomly allocated to receive compression bandaging with NSAIDs (C), aspiration (A), or aspiration with steroid injection (AS) groups (30 patients in each). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients whose bursitis resolved by Week 4. Secondary outcomes included time to resolution, pain visual analog scale (VAS), and factors associated with treatment failure. The groups were similar at baseline in terms of age and gender. Seven patients (four from Group A and three from Group AS) were lost to followup. All patients were followed up weekly for 4 weeks, and the same treatment procedure was repeated if the bursitis recurred with any substantial fluid collection. At 4 weeks, the state of resolution and pain visual analog scale (VAS) were evaluated. Failed resolution was defined as presence of persistent olecranon bursal fluid collection at Week 4 after the initiation of the treatment; on the contrary, if bursal fluid collection was clinically reduced or completely disappeared by the end of Week 4, the treatment was considered successful. We compared the proportion of resolution by Week 4 and the median times to resolution among the treatment groups. In addition, we evaluated whether the resolution affected pain VAS and what factors were associated with the resolution.\n\nResults: There were no differences in the proportion of patients whose bursitis resolved by Week 4 among the three treatment groups (Group C: 25 of 30 [83%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.27-1.72], p = 0.580; Group A: 17 of 26 [65%], relative risk of resolution failure: 2.19 [95% CI, 0.98-4.87], p = 0.083; Group AS: 23 of 27 [85%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.59 [95% CI, 0.22-1.63], p = 0.398) (p = 0.073). Time to resolution was 2.3 weeks (range, 1-4 weeks) for Group AS, 3.1 weeks (range, 2-4 weeks) for Group A, and 3.2 weeks (range, 2-4 weeks) for Group C (p = 0.015). Longer duration of symptoms before treatment was associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks (failed resolution: 6 weeks [range, 2-9 weeks]; successful resolution: 4 weeks [range, 0.4-6 weeks]; p = 0.008).\n\nConclusions: Compression bandaging with NSAIDs was not more effective than aspiration or aspiration with steroid injection in patients with nonseptic olecranon bursitis for the primary outcome of resolution by 4 weeks.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: The aim of the present study was to examine changes in radiological variables in a prospective randomized study comparing opening wedge (OW) and closing wedge (CW) techniques of high tibial osteotomy (HTO). Our hypothesis was that there would be no differences in joint line angles or correction accuracy between the two groups, that patellar height would increase after CW HTO and decrease after OW HTO, and that leg length and posterior tibial slope would decrease after CW HTO and increase after OW HTO.\n\nMethods: Radiological data were collected from 70 patients participating in an ongoing prospective randomized clinical trial comparing OW and CW HTOs. Digital standing hip-knee-ankle (HKA) radiographs as well as lateral radiographs in 30\u040e of flexion were obtained preoperatively and at 6 months for each patient. Joint line angles, HKA angle, leg length, Insall-Salvati index, Miura-Kawamura index and posterior tibial slope were measured using medical planning software. The complete preoperative radiological examinations of the first 50 patients were used in a study of intra- and inter-rater reliability of the measurements.\n\nResults: The mean posterior slope was reduced by 2.5\u040e in CW HTO, whereas it remained unchanged in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Mean leg length decreased 5.7 mm in CW HTO and increased 3.1 mm in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Changes in joint line angles, patellar height indexes and the correction accuracy showed no significant differences comparing the two techniques. Frontal plane reliability measurement intra- and inter-rater intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) varied from 0.81 to 0.99. Sagittal plane intra- and inter-rater ICC varied from 0.60 to 0.87. Posterior tibial slope intra- and inter-rater ICC showed the lowest values (0.70 and 0.60, respectively) corresponding to a smallest real difference of 4.5\u040e and 5.5\u040e, respectively.\n\nConclusions: Posterior tibial slope and leg length changes were significantly different in CW compared to OW HTOs. We recommend that possible alterations in tibial slope and leg length are considered when the technique of HTO is to be chosen. Landmark-based medical planning software shows good reliability and can be used in preoperative planning and postoperative evaluations of HTOs.",

The complete preoperative radiological examinations of the first 50 patients were used in a study of intra- and inter-rater reliability of the measurements.\n\nResults: The mean posterior slope was reduced by 2.5\u00b0 in CW HTO, whereas it remained unchanged in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Mean leg length decreased 5.7 mm in CW HTO and increased 3.1 mm in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Changes in joint line angles, patellar height indexes and the correction accuracy showed no significant differences comparing the two techniques. Frontal plane reliability measurement intra- and inter-rater intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) varied from 0.81 to 0.99. Sagittal plane intra- and inter-rater ICC varied from 0.60 to 0.87. Posterior tibial slope intra- and inter-rater ICC showed the lowest values (0.70 and 0.60, respectively) corresponding to a smallest real difference of 4.5\u00b0 and 5.5\u00b0, respectively.\n\nConclusions: Opening wedge HTO was not more effective than closing wedge HTO in patients undergoing high tibial osteotomy for radiological variables including joint line angles, correction accuracy, and patellar height indexes.",

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is potent antifibrinolytic agent, routinely administered by intravenous (IV) and topical route, which can possibly interrupt cascade of events due to hemostatic irregularities close to source of bleeding. However, scientific evidence of combined administration of TXA in TKA is still meagre. The present study aimed to compare efficacy of combined IV and topical TXA with IV use alone in terms of blood loss, transfusion rate, and incidence of deep vein thrombosis and thromboembolism.\nPatients and methods:\u0412\u00a0119 patients undergoing unilateral TKA were randomized into IV alone and combined group. Patients assigned to IV group were given IV TXA as a preoperative and postoperative dose given 3 and 6 hours after surgery, whereas in combined group, topical TXA solution was applied intraarticularly about 5 minutes before closure of arthrotomy in addition to IV doses.\nResults:\u0412\u00a0Combined use of IV and topical TXA provided better results than IV use alone with mean calculated total blood loss (590.69\u0412\u00b1191.1 vs 385.68\u0412\u00b1182.5, P<.001), blood transfusion rate (6.6% vs 1.6%, P = .364), hemoglobin drop (1.82\u0412\u00b10.6 vs 1.14\u0412\u00b10.5, P<.001). No case of DVT or TE was noted among the 2 study groups.\nConclusion:\u0412\u00a0Combined use of IV and intraarticular TXA provided significantly better results compared with IV use alone with respect to all variables related to postoperative blood loss in TKA. Moreover, TXA use is safe in terms of incidence of symptomatic DVT and TE.",

        "abstract": "Background: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is associated with substantial blood loss in postoperative period. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is potent antifibrinolytic agent, routinely administered by intravenous (IV) and topical route, which can possibly interrupt cascade of events due to hemostatic irregularities close to source of bleeding. However, scientific evidence of combined administration of TXA in TKA is still meagre. The present study aimed to compare combined IV and topical TXA with IV use alone in patients undergoing TKA.\nPatients and methods: 119 patients undergoing unilateral TKA were randomized into IV alone and combined group. The primary outcome was calculated total blood loss. Patients assigned to IV group were given IV TXA as a preoperative and postoperative dose given 3 and 6 hours after surgery, whereas in combined group, topical TXA solution was applied intraarticularly about 5 minutes before closure of arthrotomy in addition to IV doses.\nResults: Mean calculated total blood loss was 590.69\u00b1191.1 in the IV group vs 385.68\u00b1182.5 in the combined group (P<.001). Blood transfusion rate was 6.6% vs 1.6% (P = .364). Hemoglobin drop was 1.82\u00b10.6 vs 1.14\u00b10.5 (P<.001). No case of DVT or TE was noted among the 2 study groups.\nConclusion: Combined IV and topical TXA was more effective than IV use alone for calculated total blood loss in patients undergoing TKA.",

The primary and secondary outcome measures were insulin sensitivity assessed using a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test and hepatic triglyceride content with magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Exploratory outcomes were cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity and MRI and dual x-ray absorptiometry-derived measures of adiposity.\n\nResults: The study had 96% retention and attendance was 61\u00b121% and 55\u00b124% in the high- and moderate-intensity ET arms. Intention-to-treat analyses revealed that, at follow-up, insulin sensitivity was not different between high-intensity (-1.0 mU kg(-1) min(-1); 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.6, +1.4 mU kg(-1) min(-1)) and moderate-intensity (+0.26 mU kg(-1) min(-1); 95% CI: -1.3, +1.8 mU kg(-1) min(-1)) ET arms compared with controls (interaction, P=0.97). Similarly, hepatic triglyceride at follow-up was not different in high-intensity (-1.7% fat/water (F/W); 95% CI: -7.0, +3.6% F/W) and moderate-intensity (-0.40% FW; 95% CI: -6.0, +5.3% F/W) ET compared with controls. Both high intensity (+4.4 ml per kg-FFM (fat-free mass) per minute; 95% CI: 1.7, 7.1 ml kg-FFM(-1) min(-1)) and moderate intensity (+4.4 ml kg-FFM(-1) min(-1); 95% CI: 1.6, 7.3 ml kg-FFM(-1) min(-1)) increased cardiorespiratory fitness, relative to controls (interaction P<0.001).\n\nConclusions: ET improves cardiorespiratory fitness among obese adolescents; however, owing to lack of compliance, the influence of exercise intensity on insulin sensitivity and hepatic triglycerides remains unclear.",

Exploratory outcomes were cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity and MRI and dual x-ray absorptiometry-derived measures of adiposity.\n\nResults: The study had 96% retention and attendance was 61\u00b121% and 55\u00b124% in the high- and moderate-intensity ET arms. Intention-to-treat analyses revealed that, at follow-up, insulin sensitivity was not different between high-intensity (-1.0 mU kg(-1) min(-1); 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.6, +1.4 mU kg(-1) min(-1)) and moderate-intensity (+0.26 mU kg(-1) min(-1); 95% CI: -1.3, +1.8 mU kg(-1) min(-1)) ET arms compared with controls (interaction, P=0.97). Similarly, hepatic triglyceride at follow-up was not different in high-intensity (-1.7% fat/water (F/W); 95% CI: -7.0, +3.6% F/W) and moderate-intensity (-0.40% FW; 95% CI: -6.0, +5.3% F/W) ET compared with controls. Both high intensity (+4.4 ml per kg-FFM (fat-free mass) per minute; 95% CI: 1.7, 7.1 ml kg-FFM(-1) min(-1)) and moderate intensity (+4.4 ml kg-FFM(-1) min(-1); 95% CI: 1.6, 7.3 ml kg-FFM(-1) min(-1)) increased cardiorespiratory fitness, relative to controls (interaction P<0.001).\n\nConclusions: High-intensity ET was not more effective on insulin sensitivity than moderate-intensity ET in overweight adolescents.",

Patients in group 1 received a perioperative PRP infiltration at the \nrotator cuff defect, whereas the control group did not. Patients were assessed \nclinically preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and 1 \nyear. The Constant score, Simple Shoulder Test, and QuickDASH (short version of \nDisabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire) were used as outcome \nmeasures. The evolution of the cuff defect was evaluated on sonography at 3 and \n6 months and with magnetic resonance imaging after 1 year.\nRESULTS: All patients improved significantly after surgery (P\u0432\u0402\u2030<\u0432\u0402\u2030.05). There was \nno difference in clinical outcome or rotator cuff healing between groups. We \nobserved a high rate of persistent rotator cuff defects after 1 year in both \ngroups. The presence of residual cuff defects did not influence the clinical \noutcome.\nCONCLUSION: Arthroscopic needling is an operation with a predictive, good \nclinical outcome. We found a high rate of persistent rotator cuff defects after \n1 year. This study could not identify any beneficial effect of the addition of \nPRP on rotator cuff healing.",

Randomization was performed by an opaque \nenvelope, and the rates of SSI and blistering were compared between groups. The \nprimary outcome was overall SSI rate.\nRESULTS: Five seventy-seven patients completed the study and were included in \nthe final analysis. Overall SSI occurred in 9 of 283 patients (3.2%) in the \nintervention group compared to 21 of 294 patients (7.1%) in the control group \n(P = .06). Superficial SSI occurred in 5 of 283 patients (1.8%) in the \nintervention group compared to 19 of 294 patients (6.5%) in the control group \n(P = .02). There were 2 (0.7%) deep incisional SSIs in the control group, and 2 \n(0.7%) organ-space SSIs in the intervention group (P = 1.00). Skin blistering \noccurred in 10 of 283 patients (3.5%) in the intervention group versus 19 of 294 \npatients (6.5%) in the control group (P = .13).\nCONCLUSION: The SPS reapplication was not more effective than single SPS \napplication in reducing overall SSI in patients undergoing elective TJA.",

This study assessed the effect of a 6-week low-fat (LF) or portion control (PC) diet matched for weight loss on fat taste thresholds, fat perception, and preference in people with overweight/obesity.\n\nMethods: Participants (n = 53) completed a randomized dietary intervention and consumed either a LF diet (25% fat) or PC diet (33% fat) for 6 weeks. Fat taste thresholds (lowest detectable fat concentration), fat perception (discrimination ability), preference, and anthropometry were assessed at baseline and week 6.\n\nResults: Consumption of a LF diet (n = 26) and PC diet (n = 27) reduced participants' weight (P < 0.001), with no significant differences between groups (LF, -2.9%, PC, -2.7%). Both diets resulted in a decrease in fat taste thresholds (P = 0.014), and the effect tended to be stronger in the LF diet vs. the PC diet (P = 0.060). The ability to perceive different fat concentrations in foods was increased after the LF diet only (P = 0.017); however, food preference did not change on either diet.\n\nConclusions: A PC and LF diet both increase fat taste sensitivity in people with overweight/obesity, with the strongest effect after the LF diet.",

It delays mobilization, increases opioid consumption and side effects, and lengthens hospitalization. This challenge multiplies when treating an opioid-dependent population. We examined whether a novel suspended release local anesthetic, liposomal bupivacaine (LB) would improve pain control and decrease opioid consumption after TKA compared to a standard periarticular injection in opioid-dependent patients.\n\nMethods: Thirty-eight patients undergoing TKA were randomly assigned to receive either a periarticular injection (PAI) with LB (n = 20) or with a standard PAI (including a combination of ropivacaine, clonidine, Toradol, Epinepherine, and saline; n = 18) as part of a multimodal pain management approach. All periarticular injections were done by a single surgeon. Perioperative treatment was similar between groups. Postoperative information regarding pain level was evaluated by a pain visual analog scale score. Postoperative opioid consumption was recorded.\n\nResults: After controlling baseline narcotic usage before surgery, no differences were found between groups in daily postoperative narcotic usage (P = .113), average daily pain score (P = .332), or maximum daily pain score (P = .881). However, when examining pain levels separately for each day, pain visual analog scale scores were reported higher in post operative day 1 in the LB group (P = .033).\n\nConclusions: LB was not found to be superior to standard PAI in opioid-dependent patients undergoing TKA. This patient population continues to present a challenge even with modern multimodal pain protocols.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The rotator cuff tendon is known to exert a shear force between the \nsuperficial and deep layers. Owing to this characteristic, separate repair of \ndelaminated rotator cuff tears has been introduced for the restoration of the \nphysiological biomechanics of the rotator cuff. However, whether conventional en \nmasse repair or separate repair is superior is controversial in terms of \noutcomes.\nPURPOSE: To compare clinical outcomes between conventional en masse repair and \nseparate double-layer double-row repair for the treatment of delaminated rotator \ncuff tears.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled study; Level of evidence, 2.\nMETHODS: Between August 2007 and March 2014, a total of 82 patients who \nunderwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of a delaminated tear were enrolled \nand randomized into 2 groups. In group 1 (n = 48), arthroscopic conventional en \nmasse repair was performed. In group 2 (n = 34), separate double-layer \ndouble-row repair was performed. The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, \nConstant score, Simple Shoulder Test score, visual analog scale (VAS) score \nfor pain, and range of motion (ROM) were assessed before surgery; at 3, 6, and 12 \nmonths after surgery; and at the last follow-up visit. Magnetic resonance \nimaging (MRI) was performed at 12 months postoperatively to examine the retear \nrate and pattern.\nRESULTS: There was no significant difference between groups in the preoperative \ndemographic data, including patient age, sex, symptom duration, tear size, and \nfunctional scores (P > .05). The mean follow-up period was 25.9 \u00b1 1.2 months. \nNo significant differences in functional scores and ROM were found between the 2 \ngroups at each time point. Group 2 had significantly lower VAS pain scores (P < \n.05) at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Eight (17%) of 48 patients in group \n1 and 6 (18%) of 34 patients in group 2 showed retears on MRI at 12-month \nfollow-up (P > .05).\nCONCLUSION: Separate double-layer double-row repair was not more effective than \nconventional en masse repair in patients with delaminated rotator cuff tears.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The rotator cuff tendon is known to exert a shear force between the \nsuperficial and deep layers. Owing to this characteristic, separate repair of \ndelaminated rotator cuff tears has been introduced for the restoration of the \nphysiological biomechanics of the rotator cuff. However, whether conventional en \nmasse repair or separate repair is superior is controversial in terms of \noutcomes.\nPURPOSE: To compare clinical outcomes between conventional en masse repair and \nseparate double-layer double-row repair for the treatment of delaminated rotator \ncuff tears.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled study; Level of evidence, 2.\nMETHODS: Between August 2007 and March 2014, a total of 82 patients who \nunderwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of a delaminated tear were enrolled \nand randomized into 2 groups. In group 1 (n = 48), arthroscopic conventional en \nmasse repair was performed. In group 2 (n = 34), separate double-layer \ndouble-row repair was performed. The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, \nConstant score, Simple Shoulder Test score, and visual analog scale (VAS) score \nfor pain and range of motion (ROM) were assessed before surgery; at 3, 6, and 12 \nmonths after surgery; and at the last follow-up visit. Magnetic resonance \nimaging (MRI) was performed at 12 months postoperatively to examine the retear \nrate and pattern.\nRESULTS: There was no significant difference between groups in the preoperative \ndemographic data, including patient age, sex, symptom duration, tear size, and \nfunctional scores (P > .05). The mean follow-up period was 25.9 \u0412\u00b1 1.2 months. \nSignificant improvements in functional and pain scores were observed in both \ngroups at the last follow-up visit. However, no significant differences in \nfunctional scores and ROM were found between the 2 groups at each time point, \nexcept that group 2 had significantly lower VAS pain scores (P < .05) at 3, 6, \nand 12 months postoperatively. Eight (17%) of 48 patients in group 1 and 6 (18%) \nof 34 patients in group 2 showed retears on MRI at 12-month follow-up (P > .05).\nCONCLUSION: Both conventional en masse repair and separate double-layer \ndouble-row repair were effective in improving clinical outcomes in the treatment \nof delaminated rotator cuff tears. Lower pain scores were seen in patients who \nunderwent separate double-layer double-row repair.",

Biceps tenotomy and tenodesis may be preferable for selected patients: \nbiceps tenotomy for patients with definite bicipital groove tenderness and \nbiceps tenodesis for patients, especially male patients, with bicipital groove \ntenderness who want to preserve supination strength.",

This study evaluates the effects of a perioperative \ncorticosteroid regimen on IL-6 formation, thrombogenesis, fibrinolysis, and \nclinical outcomes in patients undergoing unilateral, uncemented, total hip \narthroplasty.\nMETHODS: Twenty-seven patients (14 placebo and 13 study) were enrolled in this \nrandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The primary outcome was IL-6 \nlevels. The study group received 20 mg of prednisone orally followed by 2 doses \nof intravenous hydrocortisone, each 8 hours apart. Blood was drawn at several \ntime points for IL-6, prothrombin fragment 1.2, and plasmin-alpha-2-antiplasmin \ncomplex, a marker of fibrinolysis. In-hospital visual analog pain (visual analog \nscale) scores, patient-controlled analgesia use, and ability to climb stairs \nwere recorded.\nRESULTS: Mean serum IL-6 levels at 6 and 24 hours postoperatively were \nsignificantly lower for the study group, whereas serum prothrombin fragment 1.2 \nand plasmin-alpha-2-antiplasmin were not statistically different at any study \ntime point. Average pain scores were similar (P > .05), patient-controlled \nanalgesia use was lower in the study group (P = .02). At 3 months, 4 patients \nin the placebo and 1 patient in the study group had difficulty going up and \ndown staircases (P = .08).\nCONCLUSION: Corticosteroids were not more effective than placebo on \nthrombogenic markers in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Surgery produces a rapid rise in interleukin 6 (IL-6) which may \nincrease the risk of deep vein thrombosis and medical complications. \nPerioperative corticosteroids suppress IL-6 release in patients undergoing total \nknee arthroplasty. This study evaluates the effects of a perioperative \ncorticosteroid regimen on IL-6 formation, thrombogenesis, fibrinolysis, and \nclinical outcomes in patients undergoing unilateral, uncemented, total hip \narthroplasty.\nMETHODS: Twenty-seven patients (14 placebo and 13 study) were enrolled in this \nrandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The study group received 20 \nmg of prednisone orally followed by 2 doses of intravenous hydrocortisone, each \n8 hours apart. Blood was drawn at several time points for IL-6, prothrombin \nfragment 1.2, and plasmin-alpha-2-antiplasmin complex, a marker of fibrinolysis. \nIn-hospital visual analog pain (visual analog scale) scores, patient-controlled \nanalgesia use, and ability to climb stairs were recorded.\nRESULTS: Mean serum IL-6 levels at 6 and 24 hours postoperatively were \nsignificantly lower for the study group, whereas serum prothrombin fragment 1.2 \nand plasmin-alpha-2-antiplasmin were not statistically different at any study \ntime point. Average pain scores were similar (P > .05), but study group \nexperience less severe pain (P < .01) and less patient-controlled analgesia (P\u0412\u00a0= \n.02). At 3 months, 4 patients in the placebo and 1 patient in the study group \nhad difficulty going up and down staircases (P\u0412\u00a0= .08).\nCONCLUSION: The use of corticosteroids was associated with a statistically \nsignificant decrease in IL-6 at 6 and 24 hours postoperatively but did not \naffect thrombogenic markers. The study group had improved postoperative \nanalgesia and a trend toward improved functional outcome at 3 months \npostoperatively.",

The difference in survival rate for amiodarone versus placebo was 3.2 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.4 to 7.0; P=0.08); for lidocaine versus placebo, 2.6 percentage points (95% CI, -1.0 to 6.3; P=0.16); and for amiodarone versus lidocaine, 0.7 percentage points (95% CI, -3.2 to 4.7; P=0.70).

The aim of this study was to determine whether there are middle-term differences in knee function and pain in patients undergoing fixed- and mobile-bearing total knee arthroplasty (TKA).\n\nMethods: Eligible patients were randomized into two groups: the first group received TKA implantation with a fixed tibial platform (group A); the second group received TKA with a mobile tibial platform (group B). Patients were followed up (2 years), and their symptoms and limitations in daily living activities were evaluated using the Knee Outcome Survey-Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADLS), in addition to pain evaluation assessed using the pain visual analogue scale (VAS).\n\nResults: There were no significant differences in function and symptoms in the ADLS and VAS between the study groups.\n\nConclusion: The type of platform used in TKA (fixed vs. mobile) does not change the symptoms, function or pain of patients 2 years post-surgery. Although mobile TKAs may have better short-term results, at medium- and long-term follow-up they do not present important clinical differences compared with fixed-platform TKAs. This information is important so that surgeons can choose the most suitable implant for each patient.",

Patients were followed up (2 years), and their symptoms and limitations in daily living activities were evaluated using the Knee Outcome Survey-Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADLS), in addition to pain evaluation assessed using the pain visual analogue scale (VAS).\n\nResults: There were no significant differences in function and symptoms in the ADLS and VAS between the study groups.\n\nConclusion: Mobile-bearing TKA was not more effective than fixed-bearing TKA in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.",

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination of intravenous (IV) and topical tranexamic acid (TXA) in revision THA.\n\nMethods: Eighty-four consecutive patients undergoing revision THA were randomized into combined group and IV-TXA group. Patients in the combined group were given intravenously 15 mg/kg TXA as a preoperative, and topical TXA solution was applied at a concentration of 3 g TXA per 100-mL saline during the different procedure points. Patients in the IV-TXA group were given intravenously 15 mg/kg TXA alone.\n\nResults: The mean total blood loss, drainage volume, and maximum hemoglobin drop were significantly lower in the combined group than the IV-TXA group (P < .001, P < .001, P < .001, respectively). Compared with the IV-TXA group, the amount of blood transfusions and number of blood transfusions required were decreased dramatically in the combined group (P = .027, P < .001, respectively). One deep vein thrombosis and 4 calf muscular vein thrombosis in the combined group and 3 calf muscular vein thrombosis in the IV-TXA were detected by the Doppler ultrasound. No pulmonary embolism was observed and no significant differences were found in other complications between the 2 groups.\n\nConclusion: This study showed that combined administration of IV and topical TXA in revision THA can effectively decrease total blood loss and number of blood transfusions required without increasing the risk of deep vein thrombosis or/and pulmonary embolism compared with IV-TXA alone.",

Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 1.5, \n3, 6, and 12 months after ACI and was evaluated by the magnetic resonance \nobservation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score and the Knee injury and \nOsteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS).\nRESULTS: MOCART scores showed improvements after 3 months, with slight dose \ndependence, and further improvement after 12 months, although without \nsignificant dose dependence. The mean MOCART scores after 3 months (0 = worst, \n100 = best) were 59.8, 64.5, and 64.7 for the low-, medium-, and high-dose \ngroups, respectively, and 62.9 for all patients; at 12 months, these were 74.1, \n74.5, and 68.8 for the respective dose groups and 72.4 for all patients.

However, a correlation with clinical outcomes or the failure \nrate at 1 year after ACI was not found. A longer follow-up will be required for \nmore definite conclusions on the clinical relevance of ACI cell density to be \ndrawn.\nREGISTRATION: NCT01225575 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier); 2009-016816-20 \n(EudraCT number).",

        "abstract": "Background: Tenotomy and tenodesis are common treatments for lesions in the long head of biceps tendon (LHBT); however, which treatment is superior is still controversial. This study compared the outcomes of tenotomy with outcomes of tenodesis for treatment of LHBT lesions with rotator cuff tears.\n\nMethods: The study enrolled 128 patients with LHBT lesions and small- to medium-sized rotator cuff tear. Arthroscopic LHBT tenotomy was done in 56 patients (group I), and LHBT tenodesis was done for 72 patients (group II) with rotator cuff repair. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Score, simple shoulder test, pain visual analog scale, range of motion, and cosmetic changes were assessed initially, at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively, and the last visit. The elbow motor power and magnetic resonance imaging were evaluated at 12 months.\n\nResults: Both groups showed improvement in functional scores after treatments, but no significant difference was found between the 2 groups at each assessment. The rate of Popeye deformity was 3 times higher in group I (P = .04). Group II showed greater forearm supination power than group I (P = .02). On magnetic resonance imaging, 45 patients (80.4%) in group I showed maintenance of the LHBT cut end within the bicipital groove, whereas 65 patients (90.3%) in group II showed maintenance of fixated LHBT.\n\nConclusion: For the treatment of LHBT lesions with rotator cuff tear, patients with tenotomy and tenodesis both showed significant improvements in functional scores. The incidence of Popeye deformity was about 3-times higher in tenotomy group. No significant differences in elbow motor power were observed except greater forearm supination power in the tenodesis group.",

        "abstract": "Background: Tenotomy and tenodesis are common treatments for lesions in the long head of biceps tendon (LHBT); however, which treatment is superior is still controversial. This study compared the outcomes of tenotomy with outcomes of tenodesis for treatment of LHBT lesions with rotator cuff tears.\n\nMethods: The study enrolled 128 patients with LHBT lesions and small- to medium-sized rotator cuff tear. Arthroscopic LHBT tenotomy was done in 56 patients (group I), and LHBT tenodesis was done for 72 patients (group II) with rotator cuff repair. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Score, simple shoulder test, pain visual analog scale, range of motion, cosmetic changes, elbow motor power, and magnetic resonance imaging were assessed initially, at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively, and the last visit.\n\nResults: No significant difference was found between the 2 groups in functional scores at each assessment. The rate of Popeye deformity was 3 times higher in group I (P = .04). Group II showed greater forearm supination power than group I (P = .02). On magnetic resonance imaging, 45 patients (80.4%) in group I showed maintenance of the LHBT cut end within the bicipital groove, whereas 65 patients (90.3%) in group II showed maintenance of fixated LHBT.\n\nConclusion: Tenotomy was not more effective than tenodesis in patients with LHBT lesions and rotator cuff tears.",

        "abstract": "Background: Opioid analgesics have been a standard modality for postoperative pain management after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) but are also associated with increased risk of nausea, pruritus, vomiting, respiratory depression, prolonged ileus, and cognitive dysfunction. There is still a need for a method of anesthesia that can deliver effective long-term postoperative pain relief without incurring the high cost and health burden of opioids and nerve blocks.\n\nQuestions/purposes: (1) Is liposomal bupivacaine-based periarticular injection (PAI) more effective than morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA? (2) Do patients treated with liposomal bupivacaine-based PAI experience fewer opioid-related adverse events compared with patients treated with morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA?\n\nMethods: This multicenter, blind trial randomized 119 patients undergoing TKA with spinal anesthesia to receive spinal anesthesia plus periarticular injection with liposomal bupivacaine (40 patients), spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine plus intrathecal morphine (41 patients) but no liposomal bupivacaine injection, or spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine (38 patients) and no liposomal bupivacaine injection. The two groups that did not receive periarticular liposomal bupivacaine did receive periarticular injection with ropivacaine, and all three groups had ketorolac (30 mg) plus epinephrine (1:1000) in the periarticular injections. Patients in all three groups received identical perioperative multimodal analgesic and antiemetic drugs. All patients were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized and no patients were lost to followup. The primary study endpoints were visual analog score (VAS) for pain and narcotic use during postoperative day 1. Secondary endpoints included side effects associated with narcotic administration during the hospital stay.\n\nResults: Mean VAS pain in the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group was lower than that for the ropivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (1.8 \u00b1 2.1 versus 3.3 \u00b1 2.3, p = 0.005, mean difference: 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-2.5) and 12 hours (1.5 \u00b1 2.0 versus 3.3 \u00b1 2.4, p < 0.001, mean difference: 1.8, 95% CI, 0.8-2.8) after surgery. The morphine spinal group had lower pain compared with the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (0.9 \u00b1 1.8 versus 1.8 \u00b1 2.1, p = 0.035, mean difference: 1.0, 95% CI, 0.1-1.8), but there was no difference at 12 hours (0.8 \u00b1 1.5 versus 1.5 \u00b1 2.0, p = 0.086, mean difference: 0.7, 95% CI, -0.1 to 1.5). The magnitude of the differences at 6 and 12 hours are near the lower end of minimal clinically important differences reported in the literature, and thus the improvement shown in this study may only represent a small clinical improvement. Both the liposomal bupivacaine group (13% [five of 40]) and the ropivacaine group (5% [two of 38]) had fewer incidents of itching (pruritus) than the spinal morphine group (38% [15 of 41]) (p = 0.001).\n\nConclusions: Liposomal bupivacaine-based periarticular injection was not more effective than morphine-based spinal anesthesia on visual analog score for pain and narcotic use during postoperative day 1 in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.",

        "abstract": "Background: Opioid analgesics have been a standard modality for postoperative pain management after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) but are also associated with increased risk of nausea, pruritus, vomiting, respiratory depression, prolonged ileus, and cognitive dysfunction. There is still a need for a method of anesthesia that can deliver effective long-term postoperative pain relief without incurring the high cost and health burden of opioids and nerve blocks.\n\nQuestions/purposes: (1) Is liposomal bupivacaine-based periarticular injection (PAI) more effective than morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA? (2) Do patients treated with liposomal bupivacaine-based PAI experience fewer opioid-related adverse events compared with patients treated with morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA?\n\nMethods: This multicenter, blind trial randomized 119 patients undergoing TKA with spinal anesthesia to receive spinal anesthesia plus periarticular injection with liposomal bupivacaine (40 patients), spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine plus intrathecal morphine (41 patients) but no liposomal bupivacaine injection, or spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine (38 patients) and no liposomal bupivacaine injection. The two groups that did not receive periarticular liposomal bupivacaine did receive periarticular injection with ropivacaine, and all three groups had ketorolac (30 mg) plus epinephrine (1:1000) in the periarticular injections. Patients in all three groups received identical perioperative multimodal analgesic and antiemetic drugs. All patients were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized and no patients were lost to followup. The primary study endpoints were visual analog score (VAS) for pain and narcotic use during postoperative day 1. Secondary endpoints included side effects associated with narcotic administration during the hospital stay.\n\nResults: Mean VAS pain in the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group was lower than that for the ropivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (1.8 \u00b1 2.1 versus 3.3 \u00b1 2.3, p = 0.005, mean difference: 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-2.5) and 12 hours (1.5 \u00b1 2.0 versus 3.3 \u00b1 2.4, p < 0.001, mean difference: 1.8, 95% CI, 0.8-2.8) after surgery. The morphine spinal group had lower pain compared with the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (0.9 \u00b1 1.8 versus 1.8 \u00b1 2.1, p = 0.035, mean difference: 1.0, 95% CI, 0.1-1.8), but there was no difference at 12 hours (0.8 \u00b1 1.5 versus 1.5 \u00b1 2.0, p = 0.086, mean difference: 0.7, 95% CI, -0.1 to 1.5). The magnitude of the differences at 6 and 12 hours are near the lower end of minimal clinically important differences reported in the literature, and thus the improvement shown in this study may only represent a small clinical improvement. Both the liposomal bupivacaine group (13% [five of 40]) and the ropivacaine group (5% [two of 38]) had fewer incidents of itching (pruritus) than the spinal morphine group (38% [15 of 41]) (p = 0.001).\n\nConclusions: This prospective multicenter three-arm blind randomized controlled trial showed potentially improved pain control at 6 and 12 hours in the liposomal bupivacaine and intrathecal morphine groups compared with the ropivacaine group at the cost of much higher incidences of pruritus (itching) in the intrathecal morphine group. Based on these results, we prefer the use of PAI with liposomal bupivacaine as an alternative to spinal anesthesia with intrathecal morphine as a result of similar postoperative pain control and the potential for reducing adverse events.",

The rate of laxity \n(side-to-side difference >5 mm) with an irradiated allograft (30.2%) was higher \nthan that with an autograft (7.5%) (P < .001). The failure rate in the Ir-Allo \ngroup (30.2%) was higher than that in the Auto group (7.5%) (P < .001). Anterior \nand rotational stability decreased significantly in the Ir-Allo group; patients \nin the Ir-Allo group also had a shorter operation time. There were 10.0% (4/40) \nof patients in the Auto group and 32.6% (19/43) of patients in the Ir-Allo group \nwho had arthritic progression (P < .05).\nCONCLUSION: There were no significant differences in postoperative activity \nlevels and functional outcomes between the Auto and Ir-Allo groups. However, a \nsignificant increase in anterior and rotational laxity in the Ir-Allo group was \nfound according to evaluations. We do not advocate an irradiated hamstring \ntendon allograft for DB ACLR.",

So far, estimation by \neye and palpation is the standard procedure to intraoperatively assess the \ndistance of the cup to the anterior rim. However, novel technologies such as \nimageless navigation enable intraoperative measurements of the cup in relation \nto the psoas tendon and bony landmarks.\nQUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether psoas impingement can be reduced using \nimageless navigation compared with the standard technique.\nMETHODS: The current study is a reanalysis of data from a randomized controlled \ntrial evaluating navigation for THA; 135 patients were randomized for surgery \nwith or without the use of imageless navigation. The primary outcome was the \nrisk for anterior protrusion of the cup above the acetabular rim and thus \npotential psoas impingement, defined as an overhang of the cup above the \nanterior acetabular rim as measured on postoperative CT, which was either \ncontrolled with the help of navigation or standard control by eye and palpation \nintraoperatively. Postoperatively, the anterior protrusion of the cup above the \nacetabular rim was measured on three-dimensional (3-D) CT by a blinded, external \ninstitute. In addition to patient-related outcome measures, the Harris hip \nscore, Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and EuroQol were \nobtained 1 year postoperatively. Altogether 123 data sets were available for \nprimary analysis and 115 were available for 1-year followup.\nRESULTS: There was no difference, with the numbers available, between the \nnavigated and the control groups in terms of the mean distance of the cup below \nthe anterosuperior acetabular rim (3.9 mm; -5.3 to 12.6 mm versus 4.4 mm; -7.9 \nto 13.7 mm; p = 0.72) or the anteroinferior acetabular rim (4.7 mm; -6.2 to 14.8 \nmm versus 4.2 mm; -7.1 to 16.3 mm; p = 0.29). There was no difference, with the \nnumbers available, in terms of the proportion of cups with anterior overhang \n(7%, four of 57 versus, 15%, 10 of 66; p = 0.16), respectively. After \ncontrolling for potential confounding variables such as cup inclination, cup \nsize, patient age, BMI, stage of arthritis, and length of skin incision, we \nfound cup anteversion (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% CI, 0.81-0.93; p < 0.001) \nand female sex (HR, 3.88; 95% CI, 1.01-14.93; p = 0.049) were associated with a \npropensity to potential psoas impingement. With the numbers available, there \nwere no differences observed in clinical scores between groups with and without \nanterior cup protrusion.\nCONCLUSIONS: Imageless navigation was not more effective than estimation by eye \nand palpation in preventing potential psoas impingement in patients undergoing \nTHA.",

So far, estimation by \neye and palpation is the standard procedure to intraoperatively assess the \ndistance of the cup to the anterior rim. However, novel technologies such as \nimageless navigation enable intraoperative measurements of the cup in relation \nto the psoas tendon and bony landmarks.\nQUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether psoas impingement (1) can be reduced using \nimageless navigation compared with the standard technique and (2) is associated \nwith specific patient characteristics. Furthermore, we investigated (3) if \nanterior cup protrusion (overhang) is associated with lower outcome scores for \npain and function.\nMETHODS: The current study is a reanalysis of data from a randomized controlled \ntrial evaluating navigation for THA; 135 patients were randomized for surgery \nwith or without the use of imageless navigation. The risk for anterior \nprotrusion of the cup above the acetabular rim and thus potential psoas \nimpingement, defined as an overhang of the cup above the anterior acetabular rim \nas measured on postoperative CT, was either controlled with the help of \nnavigation or standard control by eye and palpation intraoperatively. \nPostoperatively, the anterior protrusion of the cup above the acetabular rim was \nmeasured on three-dimensional (3-D) CT by a blinded, external institute.

Participants were randomly divided into three groups: EXER, exercise program; EXER + CBT, exercise program plus support group sessions for lifestyle modification, with a CBT; and CONTROL, routine treatment. The primary outcome was weight change. They were compared on weight, functional capacity, and cardiometabolic profile.\n\nResults: The weight change (Kg) was -7.4 (-9.6 to 5,1); -4,2 (-6,8 to -1.6) and 2.9 (0.4 to 5.3) and the BMI change (kg/m2) was -2.7 (-3.6 to -1.8); -1.4 (-2.4 to -0.4) and 1.1 (0.1 to 2.1) for groups EXER, EXER + CBT, and CONTROL, respectively. Changes were significant when compared to the control group (p < 0.001), but there were no differences between the two intervention arms (p = 0.2). Functional capacity and cardiometabolic parameters improved in the intervention arms and worsened in the control group. The adherence to the exercise program in both groups was above 78 %.\n\nConclusion: The exercise program was more effective than routine treatment on weight change in morbidly obese individuals awaiting bariatric surgery.",

Participants were randomly divided into three groups: EXER, exercise program; EXER + CBT, exercise program plus support group sessions for lifestyle modification, with a CBT; and CONTROL, routine treatment. They were compared on weight, functional capacity, and cardiometabolic profile.\n\nResults: The weight change (Kg) was -7.4 (-9.6 to 5,1); -4,2 (-6,8 to -1.6) and 2.9 (0.4 to 5.3) and the BMI change (kg/m2) was -2.7 (-3.6 to -1.8); -1.4 (-2.4 to -0.4) and 1.1 (0.1 to 2.1) for groups EXER, EXER + CBT, and CONTROL, respectively. Changes were significant when compared to the control group (p < 0.001), but there were no differences between the two intervention arms (p = 0.2). Functional capacity and cardiometabolic parameters significantly improved in the intervention arms and worsened in the control group. The adherence to the exercise program in both groups was above 78 %.\n\nConclusion: A 4-month, twice-weekly supervised program of low-intensity physical activity that encourages individuals to adopt a more active lifestyle can positively interfere with weight loss and improvement in functional capacity and cardiometabolic parameters of morbidly obese individuals with and without the aid of support group sessions.",

One group received preemptive intra-articular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection, and the second group received preemptive periacetabular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection. Before closure all patients received an additional dose of 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% intra-articularly. Data were compared with respect to postoperative pain with visual analog scale (VAS) and analgesic consumption, documented in a pain diary for 2 weeks after surgery.\n\nResults: Twenty-one patients were treated with intra-articular injection, and 21 patients with peri-acetabular injection. There were no significant differences with regards to patient demographics or surgical procedures. VAS scores recorded during the first 30 minutes postoperatively and 18 hours after surgery were significantly lower in the periacetabular group compared with in the intra-articular group (0.667 \u00b1 1.49 vs 2.11 \u00b1 2.29; P < .045 and 2.62 \u00b1 2.2 vs 4.79 \u00b1 2.6; P < .009). There were no differences between the groups with regard to analgesic consumption.\n\nConclusions: Periacetabular injection of bupivacaine 0.5% was superior to intra-articular injection in pain reduction after hip arthroscopy at 30 minutes and 18 hours postoperatively. However, total analgesic consumption over the first 2 postoperative weeks and VAS pain measurements were not significantly affected.",

The mean excess weight loss was 44.1 and 50.3\u0412\u00a0% in SAGB and MiniMizer \ngroups, respectively (p\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a00.14). A proportion of patients who reached a \nBMI\u0412\u00a0<\u0412\u00a035\u0412\u00a0kg/m2 was significantly larger in MiniMizer Extra group (52.9 vs \n25.5\u0412\u00a0%; p\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a00.01). Complications developed in 15 patients (14.5\u0412\u00a0%) and consisted \nof 5 band erosions, 4 port-related complications, 3 band slippages, and 3 band \nintolerances. All five band erosions developed in MiniMizer Extra group, but the \ndifference was not significant (p\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a00.058). No difference was found regarding \npostoperative complications, resolution of comorbidities, and quality of life \nbetween compared groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: SAGB and MiniMizer Extra bands demonstrated similar long-term \nresults regarding the weight loss, resolution of comorbidities, morbidity, and \nquality of life.",

Mean changes were compared between groups.\nRESULTS: Thirty adolescents (mean age 15.2 \u00b1 1.7 years, mean BMI 40.3 \u00b1 4.6 \nkg/m2) completed the meal replacement phase and were randomized; 21 completed \nthe study. The difference in mean percent change in BMI between the topiramate \nand placebo groups was not significant (-1.9%; 95% CI: -5.2% to +1.5%; \nP = 0.291). There were no concerning changes in neurocognitive function or \nbone health.\nCONCLUSIONS: Topiramate was not more effective than placebo for BMI reduction in \nadolescents with severe obesity.",

Compared with \nondansetron, ramosetron was associated with significantly lower incidence rates \nof nausea at: (1) 12-18\u0412\u00a0hours: 3/45 vs 11/45 (P\u0412\u00a0= .016), (2)\u0412\u00a018-24\u0412\u00a0hours: 1/45 \nvs 9/45 (P\u0412\u00a0= .005), and vomiting at 18-24\u0412\u00a0hours: 1/45 vs 6/45 (P\u0412\u00a0= .044). There \nwere no significant differences in the use of rescue-antiemetic medicine, pain \nscore, patient satisfaction, and ADRs.\nCONCLUSION: Preoperative ramosetron provided more prolonged PONV prophylaxis \nthan ondansetron after TKA in our setting, and had a similar ADR profile. Other \ntrials are needed to confirm our results before ramosetron is adopted widely.",

Exclusions were patients with multiple injuries, other conditions limiting mobility, and ankle injuries that required immobilisation and those unable to accommodate the time intensive study protocol.\n\nIntervention: Participants received either usual care, consisting of written instructions regarding protection, rest, cryotherapy, compression, elevation, and graduated weight bearing activities, or usual care enhanced with a supervised programme of physiotherapy.\n\nMain outcome measures: The primary outcome of efficacy was the proportion of participants reporting excellent recovery assessed with the foot and ankle outcome score (FAOS). Excellent recovery was defined as a score \u0456450/500 at three months. A difference of at least 15% increase in the absolute proportion of participants with excellent recovery was deemed clinically important. Secondary analyses included the assessment of excellent recovery at one and six months; change from baseline using continuous scores at one, three, and six months; and clinical and biomechanical measures of ankle function, assessed at one, three, and six months.\n\nResults: The absolute proportion of patients achieving excellent recovery at three months was not significantly different between the physiotherapy (98/229, 43%) and usual care (79/214, 37%) arms (absolute difference 6%, 95% confidence interval -3% to 15%). The observed trend towards benefit with physiotherapy did not increase in the per protocol analysis and was in the opposite direction by six months. These trends remained similar and were never statistically or clinically important when the FAOS was analysed as a continuous change score.\n\nConclusions: In a general population of patients seeking hospital based acute care for simple ankle sprains, there is no evidence to support a clinically important improvement in outcome with the addition of supervised physiotherapy to usual care, as provided in this protocol.",

Preoperative dose, an additional postoperative dose, and 2 postoperative additional doses of TA were infused intravenously in groups A (30 mg/kg), B (15 mg/kg), and C (10 mg/kg), respectively, and TA was not infused in group D. Blood loss (intraoperative, postoperative, and total blood loss), blood transfusion rate and volume, hemoglobin level, and incidence of deep vein thrombosis were analyzed.\n\nResults: The total blood loss and postoperative blood loss were significantly lower in groups B and C without any difference between them. As for intraoperative blood loss, there was no significant difference between groups A and B and between groups B and C with superior efficacy than group D.\n\nConclusion: With the same total dose of TA, the preoperative dose and an additional dose of TA were superior to a single preoperative dose of TA in reducing blood loss in TKA.

Preoperative dose, an additional postoperative dose, and 2 postoperative additional doses of TA were infused intravenously in groups A (30 mg/kg), B (15 mg/kg), and C (10 mg/kg), respectively, and TA was not infused in group D. Blood loss (intraoperative, postoperative, and total blood loss), blood transfusion rate and volume, hemoglobin level, and incidence of deep vein thrombosis were analyzed.\n\nResults: The total blood loss and postoperative blood loss were significantly lower in groups B and C compared to group D. There was no significant difference between groups B and C. For intraoperative blood loss, there was no significant difference between groups A and B and between groups B and C. Groups A, B, and C had lower intraoperative blood loss compared to group D.\n\nConclusion: The preoperative dose and an additional dose of TA was not more effective than 2 additional doses of TA in reducing blood loss in patients undergoing TKA.",

Included patients met the migraine criteria of the International Headache Society. Patients were randomized to intranasal lidocaine or saline solution; all participants received 10 mg of intravenous metoclopramide. Patient pain intensity was assessed with an 11-point numeric rating scale score. The primary outcome measure was the change in pain scores at 15 minutes; secondary outcomes were changes in pain intensity after pain onset and need for rescue medication.\n\nResults: Patients (n=162) were randomized into 2 groups with similar baseline migraine characteristics and numeric rating scale scores. The median reduction in numeric rating scale score at 15 minutes was 3 (interquartile range [IQR] 2 to 5) for the lidocaine group and 2 (IQR 1 to 4) for the saline solution group (median difference=1.0; 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 2.1). The reduction in pain score at 30 minutes was 4 (IQR 3 to 7) for the lidocaine group and 5 (IQR 2 to 7) for the saline solution group (median difference=1.0; 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 2.1). Need for rescue medication did not differ between the groups, and local irritation was the most common adverse event in the lidocaine group.\n\nConclusion: Although intranasal lidocaine was found no more efficacious than normal saline solution in our study, future studies should focus on patients who present earlier after headache onset.",

        "abstract": "AIMS: To investigate the metabolic effects of 12-week oral supplementation with \nLactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 in patients with type 2 diabetes on insulin \ntherapy.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: In a double-blind trial, we randomized 46 people with \ntype 2 diabetes to placebo or a low (108 \u0432\u0402\u2030CFU/d) or high dose (1010 \u0432\u0402\u2030CFU/d) of \nL. reuteri DSM 17938 for 12\u0432\u0402\u2030weeks. The primary endpoint was the effect of \nsupplementation on glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). Secondary endpoints were \ninsulin sensitivity (assessed by glucose clamp), liver fat content, body \ncomposition, body fat distribution, faecal microbiota composition and serum bile \nacids.\nRESULTS: Supplementation with L. reuteri DSM 17938 for 12\u0432\u0402\u2030weeks did not affect \nHbA1c, liver steatosis, adiposity or microbiota composition. Participants who \nreceived the highest dose of L. reuteri exhibited increases in insulin \nsensitivity index (ISI) and serum levels of the secondary bile acid deoxycholic \nacid (DCA) compared with baseline, but these differences were not significant in \nthe between-group analyses. Post hoc analysis showed that participants who \nresponded with increased ISI after L. reuteri supplementation had higher \nmicrobial diversity at baseline, and increased serum levels of DCA after \nsupplementation. In addition, increases in DCA levels correlated with \nimprovement in insulin sensitivity in the probiotic recipients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Intake of L. reuteri DSM 17938 for 12\u0432\u0402\u2030weeks did not affect HbA1c in \npeople with type 2 diabetes on insulin therapy; however, L. reuteri improved \ninsulin sensitivity in a subset of participants and we propose that high \ndiversity of the gut microbiota at baseline may be important.",

There was a significant reduction in length of stay for those that received TXA 3.58 days (0.84) compared with the control group 4.27 days (0.98) (P < .001). There was significantly less intraoperative blood loss observed in the TXA group (0.460L SD 0.228) compared with the control group (0.687L SD 0.283L) (P < .001). The estimated blood loss was also significantly less in the TXA group (1.084L SD 0.440) compared with the control group (1.394 L SD 0.426).\n\nConclusion: TXA is an effective agent in reducing blood loss in total hip arthroplasty using the anterior approach.

There are few studies \nthat provide evidence that this remains true in the long term.\nPURPOSE: To compare the long-term results of patellar instability after TTT with \nand without MPFL reconstruction in 2 randomized groups.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\nMETHODS: A total of 34 patients (36 knees) were randomized to 2 groups. The \nfirst group underwent lateral release (LR) and TTT for confirmed maltracking of \nthe patella (control group). The second group underwent MPFL reconstruction in \naddition to TTT and LR (reconstruction group). The primary outcomes were \nvalidated questionnaires (Kujala score, Tegner activity score) and a visual \nanalog scale (VAS) assessing their insecurity. Secondary outcomes included \nclinical assessment, redislocation rates, reoperation rates, time to return to \nactivities, patient satisfaction, and quantitative computed tomography (CT) at 1 \nyear. Patients were followed up at a minimum of 5 years postoperatively. Two \npatients in the control group and 1 patient in the reconstruction group were \nlost to follow-up at 5 years.\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences in the Kujala (P = .75), Tegner \n(P = .36), or VAS (P = .75) scores at any time period. One patient in the \ncontrol group sustained a patellar redislocation at 3 years. Five patients in \nthe control group and 2 in the reconstruction group had functional failures and \nrequired reoperations; however, this was not statistically significant (P = \n.30). There were no significant differences between groups in the time to return \nto school or work (P = .65) or sports (P = .38) after surgery. Patient \nsatisfaction was higher in the reconstruction group compared with the control \ngroup (P = .04), and quantitative CT scans showed that the reconstruction group \nhad improvement in the mean patellar tilt (6\u00b0 vs -8\u00b0, respectively; P = .03) and \nmean congruence angle (13\u00b0 vs -11\u00b0, respectively; P = .03) in the \nquadriceps-contracted state compared with the control group.\nCONCLUSION: TTT with MPFL reconstruction was not more effective than TTT alone \non the primary functional outcomes (Kujala score, Tegner activity score, VAS) in \npatients with patellar instability.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tibial tubercle transfer (TTT) and medial patellofemoral ligament \n(MPFL) reconstruction have both shown, either in isolation or in combination, to \nprovide improved patellofemoral joint (PFJ) stability. There are few studies \nthat provide evidence that this remains true in the long term.\nPURPOSE: To compare the long-term results of patellar instability after TTT with \nand without MPFL reconstruction in 2 randomized groups.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\nMETHODS: A total of 34 patients (36 knees) were randomized to 2 groups. The \nfirst group underwent lateral release (LR) and TTT for confirmed maltracking of \nthe patella (control group). The second group underwent MPFL reconstruction in \naddition to TTT and LR (reconstruction group). Patients were followed up with \nvalidated questionnaires (Kujala score, Tegner activity score), a visual analog \nscale (VAS) assessing their insecurity, and a clinical assessment at a minimum \nof 5 years postoperatively. Participants also underwent quantitative computed \ntomography (CT) at 1 year for comparison. Two patients in the control group and \n1 patient in the reconstruction group were lost to follow-up at 5 years.\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences in the Kujala ( P = .75), Tegner \n( P = .36), or VAS ( P = .75) scores at any time period. One patient in the \ncontrol group sustained a patellar redislocation at 3 years. Five patients in \nthe control group and 2 in the reconstruction group had functional failures and \nrequired reoperations; however, this was not statistically significant ( P = \n.30). There were no significant differences between groups in the time to return \nto school or work ( P = .65) or sports ( P = .38) after surgery. Overall patient \nsatisfaction was higher in the reconstruction group compared with the control \ngroup ( P = .04), and quantitative CT scans showed that the reconstruction group \nhad a statistically significant improvement in the mean patellar tilt (6\u0412\u00b0 vs \n-8\u0412\u00b0, respectively; P = .03) and mean congruence angle (13\u0412\u00b0 vs -11\u0412\u00b0, \nrespectively; P = .03) in the quadriceps-contracted state compared with the \ncontrol group.\nCONCLUSION: Reconstruction of the MPFL in addition to TTT and LR resulted in \nimproved alignment parameters (congruence angle, patellar tilt angle) as well as \npatient satisfaction. The Kujala and Tegner scores were no different between the \n2 groups at any time period. There was insufficient evidence to conclude that \nthe addition of MPFL reconstruction to TTT results in fewer redislocations or \nreoperations. This study concludes that MPFL reconstruction improves PFJ \nalignment and patient satisfaction; however, further studies with larger patient \nnumbers are required to satisfy its significance with respect to redislocation \nrates and functional scores in the long term.",

However, limited clinical data are available regarding the best technique \nin terms of clinical and anatomic outcomes.\nPURPOSE: To compare the clinical and anatomic outcomes of the interference screw \n(IS) and suture anchor (SA) fixation techniques for biceps tenodesis performed \nalong with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.\nMETHODS: A total of 80 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair \nwith SLBC lesions were prospectively enrolled and randomly divided according to \nthe tenodesis method: the IS and SA groups. The primary outcome was the anatomic \nstatus of tenodesis estimated using magnetic resonance imaging or \nultrasonography. Anatomic failure of tenodesis was determined when the biceps \ntendon was not traced in the intertubercular groove directly from the insertion \nsite of the IS or SA. Secondary outcomes included functional outcomes evaluated \nwith the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, American Shoulder and Elbow \nSurgeons (ASES) score, Simple Shoulder Test (SST), Constant score, Korean \nShoulder Score (KSS), and long head of the biceps (LHB) score at least 2 years \nafter surgery.\nRESULTS: Thirty-three patients in the IS group and 34 in the SA group were \nmonitored for more than 2 years. Nine anatomic failures of tenodesis were \nobserved: 7 in the IS group and 2 in the SA group (P = .083). All postoperative \nfunctional scores improved compared with the preoperative scores and were not \nsignificantly different between the groups, including the LHB score (all P > \n.05). In a multivariate analysis using logistic regression, IS fixation (P = \n.003) and a higher work level (P = .022) were factors associated with the \nanatomic failure of tenodesis. In patients with tenodesis failure, the LHB score \n(P = .049) and the degree of Popeye deformity by the patient and examiner (P = \n.004 and .018, respectively) were statistically different compared with patients \nwith intact tenodeses.\nCONCLUSION: The IS fixation technique was not more effective than SA fixation \ntechnique in preventing anatomic failure of tenodesis in patients with SLBC \nlesions undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.",

However, limited clinical data are available regarding the best technique \nin terms of clinical and anatomic outcomes.\nPURPOSE: To compare the clinical and anatomic outcomes of the interference screw \n(IS) and suture anchor (SA) fixation techniques for biceps tenodesis performed \nalong with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.\nMETHODS: A total of 80 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair \nwith SLBC lesions were prospectively enrolled and randomly divided according to \nthe tenodesis method: the IS and SA groups. Functional outcomes were evaluated \nwith the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, American Shoulder and Elbow \nSurgeons (ASES) score, Simple Shoulder Test (SST), Constant score, Korean \nShoulder Score (KSS), and long head of the biceps (LHB) score at least 2 years \nafter surgery. The anatomic status of tenodesis was estimated using magnetic \nresonance imaging or ultrasonography, and the anatomic failure of tenodesis was \ndetermined when the biceps tendon was not traced in the intertubercular groove \ndirectly from the insertion site of the IS or SA.\nRESULTS: Thirty-three patients in the IS group and 34 in the SA group were \nmonitored for more than 2 years. All postoperative functional scores improved \nsignificantly compared with the preoperative scores (all P < .001) and were not \nsignificantly different between the groups, including the LHB score (all P > \n.05). Nine anatomic failures of tenodesis were observed: 7 in the IS group and 2 \nin the SA group ( P = .083). In a multivariate analysis using logistic \nregression, IS fixation ( P = .003) and a higher (ie, more physically demanding) \nwork level ( P = .022) were factors associated with the anatomic failure of \ntenodesis significantly. In patients with tenodesis failure, the LHB score ( P = \n.049) and the degree of Popeye deformity by the patient and examiner ( P = .004 \nand .018, respectively) were statistically different compared with patients with \nintact tenodeses.\nCONCLUSION: Care must be taken while performing biceps tenodesis in patients \nwith a higher work level; IS fixation appears to pose a higher risk in terms of \nthe anatomic failure of tenodesis than SA fixation, although functional outcomes \nwere not different.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bronchiolitis is the most common lung infection in infants and \ntreatment focuses on management of respiratory distress and hypoxia. High-flow \nwarm humidified oxygen (HFWHO) is increasingly used, but has not been rigorously \nstudied in randomised trials. We aimed to examine whether HFWHO provided \nenhanced respiratory support, thereby shortening time to weaning off oxygen.\nMETHODS: In this open, phase 4, randomised controlled trial, we recruited \nchildren aged less than 24 months with moderate bronchiolitis attending the \nemergency department of the John Hunter Hospital or the medical unit of the John \nHunter Children's Hospital in New South Wales, Australia. Patients were randomly \nallocated (1:1) via opaque sealed envelopes to HFWHO (maximum flow of 1 L/kg per \nmin to a limit of 20 L/min using 1:1 air-oxygen ratio, resulting in a maximum \nFiO2 of 0\u0412\u00b76) or standard therapy (cold wall oxygen 100% via infant nasal \ncannulae at low flow to a maximum of 2 L/min) using a block size of four and \nstratifying for gestational age at birth. The primary outcome was time from \nrandomisation to last use of oxygen therapy. All randomised children were \nincluded in the primary and secondary safety analyses. This trial is registered \nwith the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number \nACTRN12612000685819.\nFINDINGS: From July 16, 2012, to May 1, 2015, we randomly assigned 202 children \nto either HFWHO (101 children) or standard therapy (101 children). Median time \nto weaning was 24 h (95% CI 18-28) for standard therapy and 20 h (95% CI 17-34) \nfor HFWHO (hazard ratio [HR] for difference in survival distributions 0\u0412\u00b79 [95% \nCI 0\u0412\u00b77-1\u0412\u00b72]; log rank p=0\u0412\u00b761). Fewer children experienced treatment failure on \nHFWHO (14 [14%]) compared with standard therapy (33 [33%]; p=0\u0412\u00b70016); of these \nchildren, those on HFWHO were supported for longer than were those on standard \ntherapy before treatment failure (HR 0\u0412\u00b73; 95% CI 0\u0412\u00b72-0\u0412\u00b76; p<0\u0412\u00b70001). 20 (61%) of \n33 children who experienced treatment failure on standard therapy were rescued \nwith HFWHO. 12 (12%) of children on standard therapy required transfer to the \nintensive care unit compared with 14 (14%) of those on HFWHO (difference -1%; \n95% CI -7 to 16; p=0\u0412\u00b741). Four adverse events occurred (oxygen desaturation and \ncondensation inhalation in the HFWHO group, and two incidences of oxygen tubing \ndisconnection in the standard therapy group); none resulted in withdrawal from \nthe trial. No oxygen-related serious adverse events occurred. Secondary \neffectiveness outcomes are reported in the Results section.\nINTERPRETATION: HFWHO did not significantly reduce time on oxygen compared with \nstandard therapy, suggesting that early use of HFWHO does not modify the \nunderlying disease process in moderately severe bronchiolitis. HFWHO might have \na role as a rescue therapy to reduce the proportion of children requiring \nhigh-cost intensive care.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bronchiolitis is the most common lung infection in infants and \ntreatment focuses on management of respiratory distress and hypoxia. High-flow \nwarm humidified oxygen (HFWHO) is increasingly used, but has not been rigorously \nstudied in randomised trials. We aimed to examine whether HFWHO provided \nenhanced respiratory support, thereby shortening time to weaning off oxygen.\nMETHODS: In this open, phase 4, randomised controlled trial, we recruited \nchildren aged less than 24 months with moderate bronchiolitis attending the \nemergency department of the John Hunter Hospital or the medical unit of the John \nHunter Children's Hospital in New South Wales, Australia. Patients were randomly \nallocated (1:1) via opaque sealed envelopes to HFWHO (maximum flow of 1 L/kg per \nmin to a limit of 20 L/min using 1:1 air-oxygen ratio, resulting in a maximum \nFiO2 of 0\u00b76) or standard therapy (cold wall oxygen 100% via infant nasal \ncannulae at low flow to a maximum of 2 L/min) using a block size of four and \nstratifying for gestational age at birth. The primary outcome was time from \nrandomisation to last use of oxygen therapy. Secondary outcomes included treatment \nfailure, time to treatment failure, intensive care unit transfer, and adverse \nevents. All randomised children were included in the primary and secondary safety \nanalyses. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical \nTrials Registry, number ACTRN12612000685819.\nFINDINGS: From July 16, 2012, to May 1, 2015, we randomly assigned 202 children \nto either HFWHO (101 children) or standard therapy (101 children). Median time \nto weaning was 24 h (95% CI 18-28) for standard therapy and 20 h (95% CI 17-34) \nfor HFWHO (hazard ratio [HR] for difference in survival distributions 0\u00b79 [95% \nCI 0\u00b77-1\u00b72]; log rank p=0\u00b761). Treatment failure occurred in 14 (14%) children \non HFWHO compared with 33 (33%) children on standard therapy (p=0\u00b70016). 12 (12%) \nof children on standard therapy required transfer to the intensive care unit \ncompared with 14 (14%) of those on HFWHO (difference -1%; 95% CI -7 to 16; \np=0\u00b741). Four adverse events occurred (oxygen desaturation and condensation \ninhalation in the HFWHO group, and two incidences of oxygen tubing disconnection \nin the standard therapy group); none resulted in withdrawal from the trial. No \noxygen-related serious adverse events occurred.\nINTERPRETATION: HFWHO was not more effective than standard therapy on time to \nweaning off oxygen in children with moderate bronchiolitis.",

Insulin sensitivity was assessed by hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamps and cardiovascular variables were measured.\n\nResults: Uric acid decreased in both groups, but significantly more in the AP than the PP group. There were no significant differences in other variables, although glycated haemoglobin levels, diastolic blood pressure and fasting non-esterified fatty acid levels improved significantly in the PP but not in the AP group. Insulin sensitivity (M-value), C-reactive protein and fasting glucose improved significantly in the AP but not in the PP group. Total and LDL cholesterol levels and systolic blood pressure decreased significantly in both groups, and the urinary albumin excretion rate decreased from baseline in participants with microalbuminuria.\n\nConclusions: Isocaloric diets high in AP or PP allow similar improvements in metabolism and cardiovascular risk factors in people with T2DM, indicating that the differences in amino acid composition do not affect the metabolic responses to the interventions.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Measured resection (MR) and gap balancing (GB) are common surgical \ntechniques for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Controversy has arisen as each \nconceptually differs in how the knee is balanced through bone and soft tissue \nmanagement. The objective of the present study was to compare both the frequency \nof condylar liftoff and the location of femorotibial contact from extension \nthrough midflexion between patients undergoing GB or MR TKA.\nMETHODS: A total of 24 knees (23 patients) were randomly assigned at referral to \neither a surgeon performing MR or GB TKA with the same single radius, \nposterior-stabilized implant (12 per cohort). At 1-year postoperation, patients \nunderwent biplanar radiographic imaging at 0\u0412\u00b0, 20\u0412\u00b0, 40\u0412\u00b0, and 60\u0412\u00b0 of flexion. \nCondylar liftoff, contact location, and magnitude of excursion on each condyle \nwere measured. Preoperative and postoperative clinical outcome scores were also \ncollected.\nRESULTS: There was no difference (P\u0412\u00a0= .41) in the frequency of liftoff between \ncohorts. The MR cohort had more posterior contact on the medial condyle (P < \n.01) and more anterior contact on the lateral condyle (P < .01) throughout \nflexion. Motion patterns were similar between cohorts, with similar medial (P\u0412\u00a0= \n.48) and lateral (P\u0412\u00a0= .44) excursion, which was equal in magnitude between \ncondyles for both MR (P\u0412\u00a0= .48) and GB (P\u0412\u00a0= .73). There was no difference in \nclinical outcome scores between groups.\nCONCLUSION: For this particular implant system, GB and MR appear to produce \nsimilar kinematic and patient-reported outcome results.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Measured resection (MR) and gap balancing (GB) are common surgical \ntechniques for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Controversy has arisen as each \nconceptually differs in how the knee is balanced through bone and soft tissue \nmanagement. The objective of the present study was to compare both the frequency \nof condylar liftoff and the location of femorotibial contact from extension \nthrough midflexion between patients undergoing GB or MR TKA.\nMETHODS: A total of 24 knees (23 patients) were randomly assigned at referral to \neither a surgeon performing MR or GB TKA with the same single radius, \nposterior-stabilized implant (12 per cohort). At 1-year postoperation, patients \nunderwent biplanar radiographic imaging at 0\u00b0, 20\u00b0, 40\u00b0, and 60\u00b0 of flexion. \nCondylar liftoff, contact location, and magnitude of excursion on each condyle \nwere measured. Preoperative and postoperative clinical outcome scores were also \ncollected.\nRESULTS: There was no difference (P = .41) in the frequency of liftoff between \ncohorts. The MR cohort had more posterior contact on the medial condyle (P < \n.01) and more anterior contact on the lateral condyle (P < .01) throughout \nflexion. Motion patterns were similar between cohorts, with similar medial (P = \n.48) and lateral (P = .44) excursion, which was equal in magnitude between \ncondyles for both MR (P = .48) and GB (P = .73). There was no difference in \nclinical outcome scores between groups.\nCONCLUSION: Gap balancing was not more effective than measured resection in \npatients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.",

        "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: We determine whether prescribing an inhaled corticosteroid \nduring a pediatric emergency department (ED) asthma visit increases ongoing use \nand improves outcomes.\nMETHODS: This randomized trial enrolled children aged 1 to 18 years, with \npersistent asthma not previously prescribed a controller medication, and who \nwere being discharged after ED asthma treatment. Intervention subjects received \na 1-month prescription for an inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone or budesonide \nby age) in addition to standard asthma therapy and instructions given to all \npatients. The primary outcome was filling of subsequent inhaled corticosteroid \nprescriptions. Secondary outcomes included filling of the intervention prescription, \nasthma-related symptoms and quality of life, and follow-up rates with a primary \ncare provider. Outcomes were assessed during telephone interviews 2 and 8 weeks \nafter the ED visit and by review of primary care provider and pharmacy records.\nRESULTS: One hundred forty-seven children were enrolled, and baseline measures \nwere similar between groups. In the intervention group, 53.5% of patients filled \nan initial ED prescription for inhaled corticosteroid. There was no important \ndifference between groups in subsequent filling of a primary care provider \nprescription (21% intervention versus 17% control; relative rate=1.24; 95% \nconfidence interval 0.63 to 2.41). Groups did not differ by rates of primary \ncare provider follow-up, functional limitations, or asthma-related symptoms and \nquality of life.\nCONCLUSION: The inhaled corticosteroid prescription was not more effective than \nstandard care in increasing subsequent filling of primary care provider \nprescriptions in children with persistent asthma discharged from the emergency \ndepartment.",

        "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: We determine whether prescribing an inhaled corticosteroid \nduring a pediatric emergency department (ED) asthma visit increases ongoing use \nand improves outcomes.\nMETHODS: This randomized trial enrolled children aged 1 to 18 years, with \npersistent asthma not previously prescribed a controller medication, and who \nwere being discharged after ED asthma treatment. Intervention subjects received \na 1-month prescription for an inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone or budesonide \nby age) in addition to standard asthma therapy and instructions given to all \npatients. Outcomes included filling of the intervention and subsequent inhaled \ncorticosteroid prescriptions, asthma-related symptoms and quality of life, and \nfollow-up rates with a primary care provider. Outcomes were assessed during \ntelephone interviews 2 and 8 weeks after the ED visit and by review of primary \ncare provider and pharmacy records.\nRESULTS: One hundred forty-seven children were enrolled, and baseline measures \nwere similar between groups. In the intervention group, 53.5% of patients filled \nan initial ED prescription for inhaled corticosteroid. There was no important \ndifference between groups in subsequent filling of a primary care provider \nprescription (21% intervention versus 17% control; relative rate=1.24; 95% \nconfidence interval 0.63 to 2.41). During the 2 weeks after the ED visit, \nintervention subjects reported reduced shortness of breath while awake and cough \nwhile asleep compared with controls. Groups did not differ by rates of primary \ncare provider follow-up, functional limitations, or asthma-related symptoms and \nquality of life.\nCONCLUSION: There was no difference in the proportion of patients who filled a \nprimary care provider prescription after ED initiation of an inhaled \ncorticosteroid. The intervention was associated with reduced reported symptoms \nbut did not affect other asthma outcomes or primary care provider follow-up.",

Extra \nstitches (GJA) were performed in 33 patients (16.5%): 3 (h) and 20 (c) in the \nV-group and 1 (h) and 9 (c) in the S-group. Four patients in the V-group \nsuffered from postoperative intraluminal bleeding (3 self-limiting, 1 underwent \nendoscopic clipping).

At 1 year postoperatively, second-look \narthroscopic surgery and biopsy of repaired cartilage were performed at the time \nof HTO plate removal.

An \nideal pain control method would have few side effects, decreased opioid \nconsumption, improved pain control, early ambulation, and decreased hospital \nlength of stay (LOS).\nMETHODS: We performed a prospective randomized, controlled study involving 79 \npatients undergoing elective THA between June 2015 and February 2016. Forty \npatients received liposomal bupivacaine and 39 patients received a fascia iliaca \ncompartment block (FICB). In addition, the medical records of 28 patients who \nunderwent elective THA between May 2015 and December 2015 were retrospectively \nexamined. The primary outcome was visual analog scale pain scores and the \nsecondary outcomes were LOS and total opioid consumption. SPSS, version 22, was \nused to run 1-way analysis of variance with contrast and Mood's median test on \nthe data.\nRESULTS: There were statistically significant decreases in pain intensity (P\u0412\u00a0= \n.019) and LOS (P\u0412\u00a0= .041) in both the liposomal bupivacaine group and the FICB \ngroup compared with those in the retrospective control group. In addition, only \nthe FICB group showed statistically significant decreased total opioid \nconsumption compared with that in the retrospective group (P\u0412\u00a0= .028).\nCONCLUSION: Patients undergoing elective THA have decreased overall pain \nintensity and a shorter LOS with multimodal pain management regimen that \nincludes either liposomal bupivacaine or FICB. Patients who received FICB \nrequired less overall total opioids than the control group.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Increasing demand for total hip arthroplasty (THA) in a climate of \nincreasing focus on clinical outcomes, patient satisfaction, and cost has \ncreated a need for better acute postoperative pain control for patients. An \nideal pain control method would have few side effects, decreased opioid \nconsumption, improved pain control, early ambulation, and decreased hospital \nlength of stay (LOS).\nMETHODS: We performed a prospective randomized, controlled study involving 79 \npatients undergoing elective THA between June 2015 and February 2016. Forty \npatients received liposomal bupivacaine and 39 patients received a fascia iliaca \ncompartment block (FICB). In addition, the medical records of 28 patients who \nunderwent elective THA between May 2015 and December 2015 were retrospectively \nexamined. The primary outcome was visual analog scale pain scores and the \nsecondary outcomes were LOS and total opioid consumption. SPSS, version 22, was \nused to run 1-way analysis of variance with contrast and Mood's median test on \nthe data.\nRESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in pain intensity \nbetween the liposomal bupivacaine group and the FICB group (P > .05). LOS was \nsimilar between the two treatment groups (P > .05). Total opioid consumption \nwas not significantly different between the liposomal bupivacaine and FICB \ngroups (P > .05). Both treatment groups showed statistically significant \ndifferences compared with the retrospective control group for pain intensity (P \n= .019) and LOS (P = .041). Only the FICB group showed statistically \nsignificant decreased total opioid consumption compared with the retrospective \ngroup (P = .028).\nCONCLUSION: Liposomal bupivacaine was not more effective than FICB on visual \nanalog scale pain scores in patients undergoing elective THA.",

        "abstract": "Background: The use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) has demonstrated mixed clinical outcomes in randomized controlled trials when compared with hyaluronic acid (HA), an accepted nonsurgical treatment for symptomatic OA. Biological analysis of PRP has demonstrated an anti-inflammatory effect on the intra-articular environment.\n\nPurpose: To compare the clinical and biological effects of an intra-articular injection of PRP with those of an intra-articular injection of HA in patients with mild to moderate knee OA.\n\nStudy design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\n\nMethods: A total of 111 patients with symptomatic unilateral knee OA received a series of either leukocyte-poor PRP or HA injections under ultrasound guidance. Clinical data were collected before treatment and at 4 time points across a 1-year period. Synovial fluid was also collected for analysis of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers before treatment and at 12 and 24 weeks after treatment. Several measures were used to assess results: (1) Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale; (2) International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee evaluation, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, and Lysholm knee score; and (3) difference in intra-articular biochemical marker concentrations.\n\nResults: There were 49 patients randomized to treatment with PRP and 50 randomized to treatment with HA. No difference was seen between the groups in the primary outcome measure (WOMAC pain score). In the secondary outcome measure, linear contrasts identified a significantly higher IKDC score in the PRP group compared with the HA group at 24 weeks (mean \u00b1 standard error [SE], 65.5 \u00b1 3.6 vs 55.8 \u00b1 3.8, respectively; P = .013) and at final follow-up (52 weeks) (57.6 \u00b1 3.37 vs 46.6 \u00b1 3.76, respectively; P = .003). Linear contrasts also identified a statistically lower VAS score in the PRP group versus the HA group at 24 weeks (mean \u00b1 SE, 34.6 \u00b1 3.24 vs 48.6 \u00b1 3.7, respectively; P = .0096) and 52 weeks (44 \u00b1 4.6 vs 57.3 \u00b1 3.8, respectively; P = .0039). An examination of fixed effects showed that patients with mild OA and a lower body mass index had a statistically significant improvement in outcomes. In the biochemical analysis, differences between groups approached significance for interleukin-1_ (mean \u00b1 SE, 0.14 \u00b1 0.05 pg/mL [PRP] vs 0.34 \u00b1 0.16 pg/mL [HA]; P = .06) and tumor necrosis factor _ (0.08 \u00b1 0.01 pg/mL [PRP] vs 0.2 \u00b1 0.18 pg/mL [HA]; P = .068) at 12-week follow-up.\n\nConclusion: We found no difference between HA and PRP at any time point in the primary outcome measure: the patient-reported WOMAC pain score. Significant improvements were seen in other patient-reported outcome measures, with results favoring PRP over HA. Preceding a significant difference in subjective outcomes favoring PRP, there was a trend toward a decrease in 2 proinflammatory cytokines, which suggest that the anti-inflammatory properties of PRP may contribute to an improvement of symptoms.",

In the biochemical analysis, differences between groups approached significance for interleukin-1_ (mean \u00b1 SE, 0.14 \u00b1 0.05 pg/mL [PRP] vs 0.34 \u00b1 0.16 pg/mL [HA]; P = .06) and tumor necrosis factor _ (0.08 \u00b1 0.01 pg/mL [PRP] vs 0.2 \u00b1 0.18 pg/mL [HA]; P = .068) at 12-week follow-up.\n\nConclusion: PRP was not more effective than HA on the WOMAC pain score in patients with mild to moderate knee OA.",

During treatment, 9% of participants lost at least 7% of their initial body weight. Participants who reported more interval life events had a lower likelihood of losing weight (P < 0.0001). However, those randomized to the small change PA/SA intervention gained less weight (+0.3% vs. 2.3% gain; P < 0.0001).\n\nConclusions: The small change PA/SA intervention did not lead to a significant difference in weight loss in comparison to the small change approach alone. It did, however, decrease the negative impact of psychosocial stressors on weight gain among participants with more interval life events.",

A total of 101 patients received arthroscopic \nrelease (n\u0412\u00a0= 50) or US-guided PRP injections (n\u0412\u00a0= 51). Outcomes were assessed \nusing a visual analog scale for pain, the Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation \n(PRTEE), and a calibrated hand dynamometer for grip strength.\nRESULTS: Both patient groups experienced significant improvement in all \nmeasures. Between-group comparisons showed a significantly higher value in the \nPRP group only for grip strength at week 8 (P\u0412\u00a0= .0073); all other significant \ndifferences were in favor of arthroscopy: overall pain (P\u0412\u00a0= .0021), night pain \n(P\u0412\u00a0= .0013), and PRTEE score (P\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a0.0013) at week 104 and grip strength at weeks \n24, 52, and 104 (all P < .0001).

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) seems to achieve equal weight loss as laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), but there is still much debate about the quality of life (QOL) after LSG, mainly concerning the association with gastroesophageal reflux. Our hypothesis is that QOL after LSG is comparable with QOL after LRYGB.\n\nMaterials and methods: Between February 2013 and February 2014, 150 patients were randomized to undergo either LSG or LRYGB in our clinic. Differences in QOL were compared between groups by using multiple QOL questionnaires at follow-up moments preoperatively and 2 and 12 months after surgery.\n\nResults: After 12 months of follow-up, 128 patients had returned the questionnaires. Most QOL questionnaires showed significant improvement in scores between the preoperative moment and after 12 months of follow-up. The Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Questionnaire (GerdQ) score deteriorated in the LSG group after 2 months, but recovered again after 12 months. After 2 months of follow-up, the mean GerdQ score was 6.95 \u00b1 2.14 in the LSG group versus 5.50 \u00b1 1.49 in the LRYGB group (p < 0.001). After 1 year, the mean GerdQ score was 6.63 \u00b1 2.26 in the LSG group and 5.60 \u00b1 1.07 in the LRYGB group (p = 0.001).\n\nConclusion: This randomized controlled trial shows that patients who underwent LSG have significantly higher GerdQ scores at both 2 and 12 months postoperatively than patients who underwent LRYGB, whereas overall QOL did not differ significantly.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pain management strategies following shoulder arthroplasty vary \nsignificantly. Liposomal bupivacaine (LB) is an extended-release delivery of a \nphospholipid bilayer encapsulating bupivacaine that can result in drug delivery \nup to 72 hours. Prior studies in lower extremity surgery demonstrated efficacy \nof LB in comparison to a single-shot peripheral nerve block; however, no study \nhas investigated LB in a total shoulder arthroplasty population. Therefore, this \nstudy compared LB vs. an indwelling interscalene nerve block (IINB).\nMETHODS: This is a prospective, randomized study of 83 consecutive shoulder \narthroplasty patients; 36 patients received LB and a \"bridge\" of 30 mL of 0.5% \nbupivacaine, and 47 patients received an IINB. The primary outcome was \npostoperative visual analog scale pain levels. Secondary outcomes included \nopiate consumption measured with oral morphine equivalents, length of hospital \nstay, and postoperative complications. Continuous variables were compared using \nan analysis of variance with significance set at P < .05.\nRESULTS: Visual analog scale pain scores were statistically higher in the LB \ncohort immediately postoperatively in the postanesthesia care unit (7.25 vs. \n1.91; P = .000) as well as for the remainder of postoperative day 0 (4.99 vs. \n3.20; P = .005) but not for the remainder of admission. Opiate consumption was \nsignificantly higher among the LB cohort in the postanesthesia care unit (31.79 \nvs. 7.47; P = .000), on postoperative day 0 (32.64 vs. 15.04; P = .000), and for \nthe total hospital admission (189.50 vs. 91.70, P = .000). Complication numbers \nand length of stay were not statistically different.\nCONCLUSION: Liposomal bupivacaine was not more effective on postoperative pain \nlevels than indwelling interscalene nerve block in patients undergoing shoulder \narthroplasty.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pain management strategies following shoulder arthroplasty vary \nsignificantly. Liposomal bupivacaine (LB) is an extended-release delivery of a \nphospholipid bilayer encapsulating bupivacaine that can result in drug delivery \nup to 72 hours. Prior studies in lower extremity surgery demonstrated efficacy \nof LB in comparison to a single-shot peripheral nerve block; however, no study \nhas investigated LB in a total shoulder arthroplasty population. Therefore, this \nstudy compared LB vs. an indwelling interscalene nerve block (IINB).\nMETHODS: This is a prospective, randomized study of 83 consecutive shoulder \narthroplasty patients; 36 patients received LB and a \"bridge\" of 30\u0432\u0402\u2030mL of 0.5% \nbupivacaine, and 47 patients received an IINB. Postoperative visual analog scale \npain levels, opiate consumption measured with oral morphine equivalents, length \nof hospital stay, and postoperative complications were recorded. Continuous \nvariables were compared using an analysis of variance with significance set at \nP\u0432\u0402\u2030<\u0432\u0402\u2030.05.\nRESULTS: Visual analog scale pain scores were statistically higher in the LB \ncohort immediately postoperatively in the postanesthesia care unit (7.25 vs. \n1.91; P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030.000) as well as for the remainder of postoperative day 0 (4.99 vs. \n3.20; P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030.005) but not for the remainder of admission. Opiate consumption was \nsignificantly higher among the LB cohort in the postanesthesia care unit (31.79 \nvs. 7.47; P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030.000), on postoperative day 0 (32.64 vs. 15.04; P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030.000), and for \nthe total hospital admission (189.50 vs. 91.70, P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030.000). Complication numbers \nand length of stay were not statistically different.\nCONCLUSION: Use of an IINB provides superior pain management in the immediate \npostoperative setting as demonstrated by decreased narcotic medication \nconsumption and lower subjective pain scores.",

Participants were divided into three groups: aerobic (A), aerobic-strength (AS), and control (C) group. Aerobic capacity was assessed with 12-min walk-run test (12MWRT).

In the AS group, the reduction of fat-free mass (FFM) was significantly lower than that in the other groups. Mean changes in 12MWRT increased significantly in the intervention groups. The mean change in the sit-to-stand scores was not statistically significant between the three groups. Comparing the intervention groups showed that mean changes in 1RM variables increased in AS group (P = 0.03).\n\nConclusions: The data suggests a positive effect of exercise on weight and PBF decrease after surgery, and it leads to significant improvement on aerobic capacity. Moreover, doing resisted exercise caused greater preserving of lean mass.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Emergency department visits for skin infections in the United States \nhave increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus \n(MRSA). For cellulitis without purulent drainage, \u041e\u0406-hemolytic streptococci are \npresumed to be the predominant pathogens. It is unknown if antimicrobial \nregimens possessing in vitro MRSA activity provide improved outcomes compared \nwith treatments lacking MRSA activity.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine whether cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole \nyields a higher clinical cure rate of uncomplicated cellulitis than cephalexin \nalone.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized \nsuperiority trial in 5 US emergency departments among outpatients older than 12 \nyears with cellulitis and no wound, purulent drainage, or abscess enrolled from \nApril 2009 through June 2012. All participants had soft tissue ultrasound \nperformed at the time of enrollment to exclude abscess. Final follow-up was \nAugust 2012.\nINTERVENTIONS: Cephalexin, 500 mg 4 times daily, plus \ntrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily, for 7 days (n\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030248 \nparticipants) or cephalexin plus placebo for 7 days (n\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030248 participants).\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome determined a priori in the \nper-protocol group was clinical cure, defined as absence of these clinical \nfailure criteria at follow-up visits: fever; increase in erythema (>25%), \nswelling, or tenderness (days 3-4); no decrease in erythema, swelling, or \ntenderness (days 8-10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness \n(days 14-21). A clinically significant difference was defined as greater than \n10%.\nRESULTS: Among 500 randomized participants, 496 (99%) were included in the \nmodified intention-to-treat analysis and 411 (82.2%) in the per-protocol \nanalysis (median age, 40 years [range, 15-78 years]; 58.4% male; 10.9% had \ndiabetes). Median length and width of erythema were 13.0 cm and 10.0 cm. In the \nper-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 182 (83.5%) of 218 \nparticipants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 165 \n(85.5%) of 193 in the cephalexin group (difference, -2.0%; 95% CI, -9.7% to \n5.7%; P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030.50). In the modified intention-to-treat population, clinical cure \noccurred in 189 (76.2%) of 248 participants in the cephalexin plus \ntrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 171 (69.0%) of 248 in the cephalexin \ngroup (difference, 7.3%; 95% CI, -1.0% to 15.5%; P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030.07). Between-group adverse \nevent rates and secondary outcomes through 7 to 9 weeks, including overnight \nhospitalization, recurrent skin infections, and similar infection in household \ncontacts, did not differ significantly.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with uncomplicated cellulitis, the use \nof cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared to cephalexin alone \ndid not result in higher rates of clinical resolution of cellulitis in the \nper-protocol analysis. However, because imprecision around the findings in the \nmodified intention-to-treat analysis included a clinically important difference \nfavoring cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, further research may be \nneeded.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Emergency department visits for skin infections in the United States \nhave increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus \n(MRSA). For cellulitis without purulent drainage, \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci are \npresumed to be the predominant pathogens. It is unknown if antimicrobial \nregimens possessing in vitro MRSA activity provide improved outcomes compared \nwith treatments lacking MRSA activity.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine whether cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole \nyields a higher clinical cure rate of uncomplicated cellulitis than cephalexin \nalone.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized \nsuperiority trial in 5 US emergency departments among outpatients older than 12 \nyears with cellulitis and no wound, purulent drainage, or abscess enrolled from \nApril 2009 through June 2012. All participants had soft tissue ultrasound \nperformed at the time of enrollment to exclude abscess. Final follow-up was \nAugust 2012.\nINTERVENTIONS: Cephalexin, 500 mg 4 times daily, plus \ntrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily, for 7 days (n = 248 \nparticipants) or cephalexin plus placebo for 7 days (n = 248 participants).\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome determined a priori in the \nper-protocol group was clinical cure, defined as absence of these clinical \nfailure criteria at follow-up visits: fever; increase in erythema (>25%), \nswelling, or tenderness (days 3-4); no decrease in erythema, swelling, or \ntenderness (days 8-10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness \n(days 14-21). A clinically significant difference was defined as greater than \n10%.\nRESULTS: Among 500 randomized participants, 496 (99%) were included in the \nmodified intention-to-treat analysis and 411 (82.2%) in the per-protocol \nanalysis (median age, 40 years [range, 15-78 years]; 58.4% male; 10.9% had \ndiabetes). Median length and width of erythema were 13.0 cm and 10.0 cm. In the \nper-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 182 (83.5%) of 218 \nparticipants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 165 \n(85.5%) of 193 in the cephalexin group (difference, -2.0%; 95% CI, -9.7% to \n5.7%; P = .50). Between-group adverse event rates and secondary outcomes through \n7 to 9 weeks, including overnight hospitalization, recurrent skin infections, \nand similar infection in household contacts, did not differ significantly.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was not \nmore effective than cephalexin alone in patients with uncomplicated cellulitis.",

Patients were \nrandomized to either internal or external cooling methods. The primary outcome \nwas survival-to-hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes included neurological \noutcomes and complications. Historical controls were selected matched by age and \ngender. Analysis using SPSS version 21.0 presented descriptive statistics and \nfrequencies while univariate logistic regression was done using R 3.1.3.\nRESULTS: 23 patients were randomized to internal cooling and 22 patients to \nexternal cooling and 42 matched controls were selected. No significant \ndifference was seen between internal and external cooling in terms of survival, \nneurological outcomes and complications. In the internal cooling arm, there was \nlower risk of developing overcooling (p=0.01) and rebound hyperthermia (p=0.02). \nCompared to normothermia, internal cooling had higher survival (OR=3.36, 95% \nCI=(1.130, 10.412), and lower risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias (OR=0.18, \n95% CI=(0.04, 0.63)). Cooling curves showed tighter temperature control for \ninternal compared to external cooling.\nCONCLUSION: Internal cooling was not more effective on survival-to-hospital \ndischarge than external cooling in post-cardiac arrest patients.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Targeted temperature management post-cardiac arrest is currently \nimplemented using various methods, broadly categorized as internal and external. \nThis study aimed to evaluate survival-to-hospital discharge and neurological \noutcomes (Glasgow-Pittsburgh Score) of post-cardiac arrest patients undergoing \ninternal cooling verses external cooling.\nMETHODOLOGY: A randomized controlled trial of post-resuscitation cardiac arrest \npatients was conducted from October 2008-September 2014. Patients were \nrandomized to either internal or external cooling methods. Historical controls \nwere selected matched by age and gender. Analysis using SPSS version 21.0 \npresented descriptive statistics and frequencies while univariate logistic \nregression was done using R 3.1.3.\nRESULTS: 23 patients were randomized to internal cooling and 22 patients to \nexternal cooling and 42 matched controls were selected. No significant \ndifference was seen between internal and external cooling in terms of survival, \nneurological outcomes and complications. However in the internal cooling arm, \nthere was lower risk of developing overcooling (p=0.01) and rebound hyperthermia \n(p=0.02). Compared to normothermia, internal cooling had higher survival \n(OR=3.36, 95% CI=(1.130, 10.412), and lower risk of developing cardiac \narrhythmias (OR=0.18, 95% CI=(0.04, 0.63)). Subgroup analysis showed those with \ncardiac cause of arrest (OR=4.29, 95% CI=(1.26, 15.80)) and sustained ROSC \n(OR=5.50, 95% CI=(1.64, 20.39)) had better survival with internal cooling \ncompared to normothermia. Cooling curves showed tighter temperature control for \ninternal compared to external cooling.\nCONCLUSION: Internal cooling showed tighter temperature control compared to \nexternal cooling. Internal cooling can potentially provide better \nsurvival-to-hospital discharge outcomes and reduce cardiac arrhythmia \ncomplications in carefully selected patients as compared to normothermia.",

Three hundred \nfifty-five adult, unconscious patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were \nenrolled from February 16, 2013, to June 1, 2016, with final follow-up on \nDecember 27, 2016.\nINTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to TTM (33\u0432\u0402\u2030\u0412\u00b1\u0432\u0402\u20301\u0412\u00b0C) for 48 hours (n\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030176) \nor 24 hours (n\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030179), followed by gradual rewarming of 0.5\u0412\u00b0C per hour until \nreaching 37\u0412\u00b0C.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was 6-month neurologic outcome, \nwith a Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) score of 1 or 2 used to define \nfavorable outcome. Secondary outcomes included 6-month mortality, including time \nto death, the occurrence of adverse events, and intensive care unit resource \nuse.\nRESULTS: In 355 patients who were randomized (mean age, 60 years; 295 [83%] \nmen), 351 (99%) completed the trial. Of these patients, 69% (120/175) in the \n48-hour group had a favorable outcome at 6 months compared with 64% (112/176) in \nthe 24-hour group (difference, 4.9%; 95% CI, -5% to 14.8%; relative risk [RR], \n1.08; 95% CI, 0.93-1.25; P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030.33).

A total \nof 55 patients (91.7%) underwent a clinical review and magnetic resonance \nimaging (MRI) at a mean of 3.5 years after surgery (range, 36-51 months). \nPatient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) included the Constant score, Quick \nDisabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH) questionnaire, Oxford \nShoulder Score (OSS), and visual analog scale (VAS) for pain. Global rating of \nchange (GRC) scale and patient satisfaction scores were evaluated. Structural \nintegrity of the surgical repair was assessed via MRI using the Sugaya \nclassification system.\nRESULTS: At the midterm review, there was no difference between the groups for \nany of the PROMs. No differences between the groups were demonstrated for the \nsubjective and range of motion subscales of the Constant score. The Constant \nstrength subscale score was higher in the PRP group (3.3 points; 95% CI, 1.0-5.7; \nP = .006). There was no evidence for any group differences in MRI scores or retear \nrates, with 66.7% of PRP patients and 64.3% of control patients rated as Sugaya \ngrade 1. Two control patients had symptomatic retears (both full thickness) within \nthe first 16 weeks after surgery compared with 2 PRP patients, who suffered \nsymptomatic retears (both partial thickness) between 16 weeks and a mean 3.5-year \nfollow-up.\nCONCLUSION: PRP was not more effective than control in improving clinical and \nradiographic outcomes in patients undergoing arthroscopic supraspinatus repair.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been applied as an adjunct to rotator \ncuff repair to improve tendon-bone healing and potentially reduce the incidence \nof subsequent tendon retears.\nPURPOSE: To investigate whether the midterm clinical and radiographic outcomes \nof arthroscopic supraspinatus repair are enhanced after repeated postoperative \napplications of PRP.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\nMETHODS: A total of 60 patients (30 control; 30 PRP) were initially randomized \nto receive 2 ultrasound-guided injections of PRP to the tendon repair site at 7 \nand 14 days after double-row arthroscopic supraspinatus repair or not. A total \nof 55 patients (91.7%) underwent a clinical review and magnetic resonance \nimaging (MRI) at a mean of 3.5 years after surgery (range, 36-51 months). \nPatient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) included the Constant score, Quick \nDisabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH) questionnaire, Oxford \nShoulder Score (OSS), and visual analog scale (VAS) for pain. Global rating of \nchange (GRC) scale and patient satisfaction scores were evaluated. Structural \nintegrity of the surgical repair was assessed via MRI using the Sugaya \nclassification system.\nRESULTS: At the midterm review, there was no difference between the groups for \nany of the PROMs. No differences between the groups were demonstrated for the \nsubjective and range of motion subscales of the Constant score, although a \nsignificantly higher Constant strength subscale score was observed in the PRP \ngroup (3.3 points; 95% CI, 1.0-5.7; P = .006). There was no evidence for any \ngroup differences in MRI scores or retear rates, with 66.7% of PRP patients and \n64.3% of control patients rated as Sugaya grade 1. Two control patients had \nsymptomatic retears (both full thickness) within the first 16 weeks after \nsurgery compared with 2 PRP patients, who suffered symptomatic retears (both \npartial thickness) between 16 weeks and a mean 3.5-year follow-up.\nCONCLUSION: Significant postoperative clinical improvements and high levels of \npatient satisfaction were observed in patients at the midterm review after \nsupraspinatus repair. While pain-free, maximal abduction strength was greater in \nthe midterm after PRP treatment, repeated applications of PRP delivered at 7 and \n14 days after surgery provided no additional benefit to tendon integrity.",

The goal of this study was to assess \nthe impact of LB compared with continuous interscalene nerve block (CISB) in \nterms of postoperative pain control, outpatient pain scores, and \npatient-reported and functional outcomes after shoulder arthroplasty surgery.\nMETHODS: A prospective randomized controlled clinical trial compared consecutive \npatients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty treated with CISB vs. LB with a single \nbolus interscalene block. The primary outcome measures included pain assessment \nup to 24 hours after surgery; in addition, all doses and times of narcotics \nadministered during the inpatient stay were recorded.

Randomization was by minimization (age and \nethnicity), with participants assigned to an intense intervention group \n(home-based assessments at 6-month intervals and a 12-month multidisciplinary \nprogram with weekly group sessions) or to a minimal-intensity control group with \nhome-based assessments and advice at each 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome \nwas the change in BMI standard deviation score (SDS) at 12 months from baseline. \nA mixed model analysis was undertaken, incorporating all 6- and 12-month data.\nRESULTS: Two hundred and three children were randomly assigned (47% M\u0414\u0403ori, 43% \nNew Zealand European, 53% female, 28% from the most deprived quintile, mean age \n10.7 years, mean BMI SDS 3.12). Both groups displayed a change in BMI SDS at 12 \nmonths from baseline (-0.12 control, -0.10 intervention), improvements in \ncardiovascular fitness (P\u0432\u0402\u2030<\u0432\u0402\u20300.0001), and improvements in quality of life \n(P\u0432\u0402\u2030<\u0432\u0402\u20300.001).

Randomization was by minimization (age and \nethnicity), with participants assigned to an intense intervention group \n(home-based assessments at 6-month intervals and a 12-month multidisciplinary \nprogram with weekly group sessions) or to a minimal-intensity control group with \nhome-based assessments and advice at each 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome \nwas the change in BMI standard deviation score (SDS) at 12 months from baseline. \nSecondary outcomes included cardiovascular fitness and quality of life. A mixed \nmodel analysis was undertaken, incorporating all 6- and 12-month data.\nRESULTS: Two hundred and three children were randomly assigned (47% M\u0101ori, 43% \nNew Zealand European, 53% female, 28% from the most deprived quintile, mean age \n10.7 years, mean BMI SDS 3.12). Change in BMI SDS at 12 months from baseline was \n-0.12 in the control group and -0.10 in the intervention group. Both groups had \nimprovements in cardiovascular fitness (P < 0.0001) and improvements in quality \nof life (P < 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: The intensive intervention was not more effective than the control \nintervention on BMI SDS in children with obesity.",

The primary outcome was the number of \ndiarrhoea and vomiting episodes during the 24 hours following treatment. \nSecondary outcomes included the number of days with symptoms. Pathogens in \nfaeces were diagnosed by real-time PCR.\nRESULTS: The number of diarrhoea and vomiting episodes during the 24 hours \nfollowing treatment was not significantly different between ondansetron and \nplacebo groups. One dose of oral ondansetron reduced duration of rotavirus \nclinical symptoms (p = 0.014), with a median of two days. Furthermore, \nondansetron reduced diarrhea episodes, most pronounced in children that had been \nsick for more than 3 days before treatment (p = 0.028).\nCONCLUSION: Ondansetron was not more effective than placebo on the number of \ndiarrhoea and vomiting episodes during the 24 hours following treatment in \nchildren with acute gastroenteritis.",

Participants completed a 4-week smartphone headache diary at baseline, posttreatment (16-20 wk), and follow-up (32-36 wk). The primary outcome was posttreatment change in migraine days per month, analyzed via linear mixed effects models.\n\nResults: Of 110 participants randomly assigned, 85 (78%) and 80 (73%) completed posttreatment and follow-up. The BWL group achieved greater weight loss (mean [95% CI] in kilograms) than the ME group at posttreatment (-3.8 [-2.5 to -5.0] vs. + 0.9 [-0.4 to 2.2], P < 0.001) and follow-up (-3.2 [-2.0 to -4.5] vs. + 1.1 [-0.2 to 2.4], P < 0.001). There were no significant group (BWL vs. ME) differences (mean [95% CI]) in migraine days per month at posttreatment (-3.0 [-2.0 to -4.0] vs. -4.0 [-2.9 to -5.0], P = 0.185) or follow-up (-3.8 [-2.7 to -4.8] vs. -4.4 [-3.4 to -5.5], P = 0.378).\n\nConclusions: BWL was not more effective than ME on migraine days per month in women with comorbid migraine and overweight or obesity.",

        "abstract": "Objective: The objective of this study was to test whether behavioral weight loss (BWL) intervention decreases headaches in women with comorbid migraine and overweight or obesity.\n\nMethods: This randomized, single-blind trial allocated women 18 to 50 years old with 4 to 20 migraine days per month and a BMI = 25.0-49.9 kg/m2 to 16 weeks of BWL (n = 54), which targeted exercise and eating behaviors for weight loss, or to migraine education control (ME, n = 56), which delivered didactic instruction on migraine and treatments. Participants completed a 4-week smartphone headache diary at baseline, posttreatment (16-20 wk), and follow-up (32-36 wk). The primary outcome was posttreatment change in migraine days per month, analyzed via linear mixed effects models.\n\nResults: Of 110 participants randomly assigned, 85 (78%) and 80 (73%) completed posttreatment and follow-up. Although the BWL group achieved greater weight loss (mean [95% CI] in kilograms) than the ME group at posttreatment (-3.8 [-2.5 to -5.0] vs. + 0.9 [-0.4 to 2.2], P < 0.001) and follow-up (-3.2 [-2.0 to -4.5] vs. + 1.1 [-0.2 to 2.4], P < 0.001), there were no significant group (BWL vs. ME) differences (mean [95% CI]) in migraine days per month at posttreatment (-3.0 [-2.0 to -4.0] vs. -4.0 [-2.9 to -5.0], P = 0.185) or follow-up (-3.8 [-2.7 to -4.8] vs. -4.4 [-3.4 to -5.5], P = 0.378).\n\nConclusions: Contrary to hypotheses, BWL and ME yielded similar, sustained reductions in migraine headaches. Future research should evaluate whether adding BWL to standard pharmacological and/or nonpharmacological migraine treatment approaches yields greater benefits.",

Randomized \ncontrolled trials comparing LP- or LR-PRP with a control alongside ARCR were \nincluded. Clinical outcomes, including retears and functional outcomes, were \ncompared using a frequentist approach to network meta-analysis, with statistical \nanalysis performed using R. The treatment options were ranked using the P-score.\nRESULTS: There were 13 studies (868 patients) included, with 9 studies comparing \nLP-PRP with a control and 4 studies comparing LR-PRP with a control. LP-PRP was \nfound to significantly reduce the rate of retear and/or incomplete tendon \nhealing after fixation, even among medium-large tears; it also improved outcomes \non the visual analog scale for pain, Constant score, and University of \nCalifornia Los Angeles score. LP-PRP had the highest P-score for all treatment \ngroups. LR-PRP did not result in any significant improvements over the control \ngroup, except for visual analog scale score for pain. However, post hoc analysis \nrevealed that LP-PRP did not lead to significant improvements over LR-PRP in any \ncategory.\nCONCLUSION: The current study demonstrates that LP-PRP reduces the rate of \nretear and/or incomplete tendon healing after ARCR and improves patient-reported \noutcomes as compared with a control. However, it is still unclear whether LP-PRP \nimproves the tendon healing rate when compared with LR-PRP.",

Randomized \ncontrolled trials comparing LP- or LR-PRP with a control alongside ARCR were \nincluded. Clinical outcomes, including retears and functional outcomes, were \ncompared using a frequentist approach to network meta-analysis, with statistical \nanalysis performed using R. The treatment options were ranked using the P-score.\nRESULTS: There were 13 studies (868 patients) included, with 9 studies comparing \nLP-PRP with a control and 4 studies comparing LR-PRP with a control. LP-PRP was \nfound to reduce the rate of retear and/or incomplete tendon healing after \nfixation; it also improved outcomes on the visual analog scale for pain, \nConstant score, and University of California Los Angeles score. LP-PRP had the \nhighest P-score for all treatment groups. LR-PRP did not result in any \nsignificant improvements over the control group, except for visual analog scale \nscore for pain. Post hoc analysis revealed that LP-PRP did not lead to \nsignificant improvements over LR-PRP in any category.\nCONCLUSION: LP-PRP was not more effective than LR-PRP in patients undergoing \narthroscopic rotator cuff repair.",
