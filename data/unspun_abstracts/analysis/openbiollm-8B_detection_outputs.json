        "abstract": "Purpose\nTo determine if anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is superior to anatomic single-bundle reconstruction in restoring the stabilities and functions of the knee joint.\nMethods\nA prospective randomized clinical study was done to compare the results of 32 cases of anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction and 34 cases of anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction with average follow-up of 16.3 \u0412\u00b1 3.1\u0412\u00a0months. Tunnel placements of all the cases were measured on 3D CT. Clinical results were collected after reconstruction; graft's appearance, meniscus status and cartilage state under arthroscopy were compared and analysed too.\nResults\nTunnel placements, confirmed with 3D CT, were in the anatomic positions as described in literature both in SB and DB group. No differences were found between SB and DB groups in clinical outcome scores, pivot shift test and KT 1000\u0412\u00a0measurements (average side-to-side difference for anterior tibial translation was 0.7\u0412\u00a0mm in SB group and 1.0\u0412\u00a0mm in DB group). More than 70 % of the single-bundle graft and AM bundle graft in DB group appeared excellent, but only 44.1 % of PL bundle grafts in DB group were excellent and 11.8 % were in poor state. No new menisci tear was found either in SB or DB group, however, in DB group cartilage damages in medial patella-femoral joint occurred in 38.2 % cases. This rate was significantly higher than in the SB group which is only 9.3 %.\nConclusion\nBoth single- and double-bundle anatomic ACL reconstruction can restore the knee's stability and functions very well. However, more incidences of poor PL status and medial patellar-femoral cartilage damage may occur in double-bundle ACL reconstruction.",

Subjects were randomly assigned to usual care or one of 3 prescription information or services intervention groups: (1) practical services to reduce barriers to prescription filling (practical prescription information or services); (2) consumer drug information from MedlinePlus (MedlinePlus prescription information or services); or (3) both services and information (combination prescription information or services). Self-reported medication adherence, measured by primary adherence (prescription filling) and persistence (receiving medicine as prescribed) rates, was determined during a telephone interview 1 week postdischarge.\n\nResults: Of the 3,940 subjects enrolled and randomly allocated to treatment, 86% (N=3,386) completed the follow-up interview. Overall, primary adherence was 88% and persistence was 48%. Across the sites, primary adherence and persistence did not differ significantly between usual care and the prescription information or services groups. However, at site C, subjects who received the practical prescription information or services (odds ratio [OR]=2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4 to 4.3) or combination prescription information or services (OR=1.8; 95% CI 1.1 to 3.1) were more likely to fill their prescription compared with usual care. Among subjects prescribed a drug that treats an underlying condition, subjects who received the practical prescription information or services were more likely to fill their prescription (OR=1.8; 95% CI 1.0 to 3.1) compared with subjects who received usual care.\n\nConclusion: Prescription filling and receiving medications as prescribed was not meaningfully improved by offering patients patient-centered prescription information and services.",

Subjects were randomly assigned to usual care or one of 3 prescription information or services intervention groups: (1) practical services to reduce barriers to prescription filling (practical prescription information or services); (2) consumer drug information from MedlinePlus (MedlinePlus prescription information or services); or (3) both services and information (combination prescription information or services). Self-reported medication adherence, measured by primary adherence (prescription filling) and persistence (receiving medicine as prescribed) rates, was determined during a telephone interview 1 week postdischarge.\n\nResults: Of the 3,940 subjects enrolled and randomly allocated to treatment, 86% (N=3,386) completed the follow-up interview. Overall, primary adherence was 88% and persistence was 48%. Primary adherence and persistence did not differ significantly between usual care and the prescription information or services groups.\n\nConclusion: The prescription information or services interventions were not more effective than usual care in improving medication adherence in emergency department patients.",

Despite intensive marketing by the manufacturers, this claim has not yet been confirmed in a controlled prospective trial.\n\nQuestions/purposes: We (1) compared three-planar component alignment and overall coronal mechanical alignment between PSG and conventional instrumentation and (2) logged the need for applying changes in the suggested position of the PSG.\n\nMethods: In this randomized controlled trial, we enrolled 128 patients. The primary outcome was overall coronal mechanical alignment. Secondary outcomes included femoral coronal alignment, femoral axial alignment, tibial coronal alignment, and tibial sagittal alignment. In the PSG cohort, surgical navigation was used as an intraoperative control. When the suggested cut deviated more than 3\u00b0 from target, the use of PSG was abandoned and marked as an outlier. When cranial-caudal position or size was adapted, the PSG was marked as modified. All patients underwent long-leg standing radiography and CT scan. Deviation of more than 3\u00b0 from the target in any plane was defined as an outlier.\n\nResults: The PSG and conventional cohorts showed similar numbers of outliers in overall coronal alignment (25% versus 28%; p = 0.69). There were more outliers in tibial coronal (15% versus 3%; p = 0.03) and sagittal (21% versus 3%; p = 0.002) alignment in the PSG group than in the conventional group. The PSG group showed similar outlier rates for femoral coronal alignment (7% versus 14%; p = 0.24) and femoral axial alignment (23% versus 17%; p = 0.50). PSGs were abandoned in 14 patients (22%) and modified in 18 (28%).\n\nConclusions: PSGs were not more effective than conventional instrumentation for overall coronal mechanical alignment in patients undergoing TKA.",

The contrast-induced nephropathy rate in patients \nreceiving less than 1 L intravenous fluids in the emergency department (ED) was \n19 of 147 (12.9%) versus 7 of 210 (3.3%) for greater than 1 L intravenous fluids \n(difference 9.6%; 95% confidence interval 3.7% to 15.5%), a 69% risk reduction \n(odds ratio 0.41; 95% confidence interval 0.21 to 0.80) per liter of intravenous \nfluids.\nCONCLUSION: We did not find evidence of a benefit for N-acetylcysteine \nadministration to our ED patients undergoing contrast-enhanced CT. However, we \ndid find a significant association between volume of intravenous fluids \nadministered and reduction in contrast-induced nephropathy.",

A total of 151 patients were randomly assigned to the tenotomy group (77 patients) or the tenodesis group (74 patients). Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was performed in all the patients. Before surgery, physical and radiological examinations were performed; the constant score was measured as well.

No significant differences in the clinical results for the constant scores, the forearm supination and elbow flexion strength indices, Popeye sign, cramping pain and satisfaction level were found between the groups. However, tenotomy required a shorter surgical time (40.4 \u00b1 4.0 vs. 50.4 \u00b1 5.9 min, P < 0.001) and resulted in faster pain relief (3.1 \u00b1 1.8 vs. 4.8 \u00b1 1.9, P < 0.001).\n\nConclusion: Both tenotomy and tenodesis are effective and equal for the treatment of long head biceps lesions.

However, there are unanswered questions about the performance of hemiarthroplasty over the longer term compared with internal fixation.\n\nQuestions/purposes: We sought to compare hemiarthroplasty with internal fixation in terms of (1) outcomes scores for pain, hip function, and quality of life at a minimum of 5 years after surgery in a randomized trial. A secondary purpose was to compare (2) patient survival and (3) frequency of reoperation in the two groups.\n\nMethods: A total of 222 consecutive patients older than 60 years, including those cognitively impaired, with FNF were randomized to either internal fixation with two parallel screws or bipolar hemiarthroplasty. At a minimum followup of 4.9 years (mean, 5.9 years; range, 4.9-7.2 years), 68 of the 70 surviving patients were examined by a study nurse and study physiotherapist blinded to initial treatment. Questionnaires on hip function (Harris hip score), quality of life (Eq5D), and activity of daily living function (Barthel ADL) were administered. The Barthel ADL index score was split into good function (score 95 or 100) and reduced function (score below 95).\n\nResults: The mean survival of the groups was similar with 66.4% (73 of 110) of the patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty and 70.5% (79 of 112) of the patients undergoing internal fixation having died since surgery (p = 0.51). Only 12 of 31 living patients in the internal fixation group had retained their native hips at a mean of 6 years. Between 2 and 6 years, there were two new major reoperations (both in the internal fixation group, for avascular necrosis and deep wound infection). The mean Harris hip score was 66 (SD 19) and 67 (SD 20) in the internal fixation and hemiarthroplasty groups, respectively (p = 0.96). The mean Eq5D index was 0.50 (SD 0.40) in the internal fixation group and 0.34 (SD 0.36) in the hemiarthroplasty group (p = 0.10). Function in terms of ADLs was comparable between the groups; of the patients in the internal fixation group, 42% reported good function on the Barthel ADL index, and the corresponding number in the hemiarthroplasty group was 51% (p = 0.44).\n\nConclusions: Hemiarthroplasty has predictable and good long-term results after FNF and is the treatment of choice compared with internal fixation. Further studies will evaluate if total hip arthroplasty has advantages over hemiarthroplasty in patients with fracture with long life expectancy.",

        "abstract": "Background: The infrapatellar fat pad is one of the structures that obscures exposure in minimally invasive total knee arthroplasty (MIS TKA). Most MIS TKA surgeons (and many surgeons who use other approaches as well) excise the fat pad for better exposure of the knee. There is still controversy about the result of fat pad excision on patella baja, pain, and function.\n\nQuestions/purposes: In the setting of a randomized controlled trial, we sought to determine whether infrapatellar fat pad excision during MIS TKA causes (1) patellar tendon shortening (as measured by patella baja); (2) increased anterior knee pain; (3) decreases in the Knee Society Score or functional subscore; or (4) more patella-related complications.\n\nMethods: We randomized 90 patients undergoing MIS TKA at one institution into two groups. In one group, 45 patients underwent MIS TKA with complete infrapatellar fat pad excision and in the other group, 45 patients received MIS TKA without infrapatellar fat pad excision. The patella was selectively resurfaced in these patients; there was no difference between the groups in terms of the percentage of patients whose patellae were resurfaced. We measured patellar tendon shortening, knee flexion, anterior knee pain, Knee Society Score (KSS), functional subscore, and patellar complications at preoperative and postoperative periods of 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year; complete followup data were available on 86% of patients (77 of 90) who were enrolled.\n\nResults: At the final followup, no significant differences were observed in patellar tendon shortening, KSS, functional subscore, or knee flexion in either group. However, patients with their infrapatellar fat pad excised experienced more anterior knee pain (8.3% versus 0%; p = 0.03; 95% confidence interval, -0.007 to 0.174) at the end of the study. No patellar complications were found in either group.\n\nConclusions: Infrapatellar fat pad excision in MIS TKA resulted in an increasing small percentage of patients with anterior knee pain after surgery. Surgeons should keep the fat pad if excellent exposure can be achieved but resect it if needed to improve exposure during TKA.",

A prospective blinded randomized controlled trial was completed with 103 patients randomized to measured resection (n = 52) or gap balancing (n = 51). Primary outcome measure was femoral component rotation. Secondary outcome measures were joint-line change, gap symmetry and function and quality-of-life outcomes. Gap balancing resulted in a significantly raised joint-line compared to measured resection. Gap symmetry was significantly better using gap balancing.

We seek to \ndetermine whether a scalable, low-cost, unidirectional, text message-based \nmobile health intervention (TExT-MED) improves clinical outcomes, increases \nhealthy behaviors, and decreases ED utilization in a safety net population.\nMETHODS: We conducted an randomized controlled trial of 128 adult patients with \npoorly controlled diabetes (glycosylated hemoglobin [Hb A1C] level \u0432\u2030\u04908%) in an \nurban, public ED. The TExT-MED group received 2 daily text messages for 6 months \nin English or Spanish. The primary outcome was change in Hb A1C level. Secondary \noutcomes included changes in medication adherence, self-efficacy, performance of \nself-care tasks, quality of life, diabetes-specific knowledge, ED utilization, \nand patient satisfaction.\nRESULTS: Hb A1C level decreased by 1.05% in the TExT-MED group compared with \n0.60% in the controls (\u041e\u201d0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.27 to 1.17) at 6 \nmonths. Secondary outcomes favored the TExT-MED group, with the most sizable \nchange observed in self-reported medication adherence (as measured by the \nMorisky Medication Adherence Scale, an 8-point validated scale with higher \nscores representing better adherence), which improved from 4.5 to 5.4 in the \nTExT-MED group compared with a net decrease of -0.1 in the controls (\u041e\u201d1.1 [95% \nCI 0.1 to 2.1]). Effects were larger among Spanish speakers for both medication \nadherence (1.1 versus -0.3; \u041e\u201d1.4; 95% CI 0.2 to 2.7) and Hb A1C (-1.2% versus \n-0.4%) in the TExT-MED group. The proportion of patients who used emergency \nservices trended lower in the TExT-MED group (35.9% versus 51.6%; \u041e\u201d15.7%; 95% CI \n9.4% to 22%). Overall, 93.6% of respondents enjoyed TExT-MED and 100% would \nrecommend it to family/friends.\nCONCLUSION: The TExT-MED program did not result in a statistically significant \nimprovement in Hb A1C. However, trends toward improvement in the primary outcome \nof Hb A1C and other secondary outcomes, including quality of life, were \nobserved, the most pronounced being improved medication adherence. TExT-MED also \ndecreased ED utilization. These findings were magnified in the Spanish-speaking \nsubgroup. Technologies such as TExT-MED represent highly scalable, low-cost, and \nwidely accessible solutions for safety-net ED populations.",

The TExT-MED group received 2 daily text messages for 6 months \nin English or Spanish. The primary outcome was change in Hb A1C level. Secondary \noutcomes included changes in medication adherence, self-efficacy, performance of \nself-care tasks, quality of life, diabetes-specific knowledge, ED utilization, \nand patient satisfaction.\nRESULTS: Hb A1C level decreased by 1.05% in the TExT-MED group compared with \n0.60% in the controls (\u03940.45; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.27 to 1.17) at 6 \nmonths. Self-reported medication adherence (as measured by the Morisky Medication \nAdherence Scale, an 8-point validated scale with higher scores representing \nbetter adherence) improved from 4.5 to 5.4 in the TExT-MED group compared with \na net decrease of -0.1 in the controls (\u03941.1 [95% CI 0.1 to 2.1]). The \nproportion of patients who used emergency services was 35.9% in the TExT-MED \ngroup versus 51.6% in controls (\u039415.7%; 95% CI 9.4% to 22%). Overall, 93.6% of \nrespondents enjoyed TExT-MED and 100% would recommend it to family/friends.\nCONCLUSION: The TExT-MED program was not more effective on Hb A1C than control \nin patients with poorly controlled diabetes.",

The exclusion criteria were \nrheumatological joint disease, previous knee surgery, anticoagulant therapy and \nhypertension.

All the patients were treated with the same anaesthesia method, surgical team, surgical technique, prosthesis type, and rehabilitation process. American Knee Society Score values and knee flexion degrees were recorded. Isokinetic muscle strength measurements of both knees in flexion and extension were taken using 60\u0412\u00b0 and 180\u0412\u00b0/s angular velocity. The peak torque and total work values, isokinetic muscle strength differences, and total work difference values were calculated for surgically repaired and healthy knees.\nResults:\u0412\u00a0No significant difference in the mean American Knee Society Score values and knee flexion degrees was observed between the two groups. However, using isokinetic evaluation, a significant difference was found in the isokinetic muscle strength differences and total work difference of the flexor muscle between the two groups when patients were tested at 180\u0412\u00b0/s. Less loss of strength was detected in the isokinetic muscle strength differences of the flexor muscle in Group 2 (-4.2%) than in Group 1 (-23.1%).\nConclusion:\u0412\u00a0For patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty, post-operative flexor muscle strength is improved if the knee is flexed during wound closure.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of knee position during wound closure (flexed vs. extended) in total knee arthroplasty on knee strength and function, as determined by knee society scores and isokinetic testing of extensor and flexor muscle groups.\nMethods: In a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial, 29 patients were divided in two groups: for Group 1 patients, surgical closing was performed with the knee extended, and for Group 2 patients, the knee flexed at 90\u00b0. All the patients were treated with the same anaesthesia method, surgical team, surgical technique, prosthesis type, and rehabilitation process. The primary outcome was American Knee Society Score values. Secondary outcomes included knee flexion degrees and isokinetic muscle strength measurements of both knees in flexion and extension using 60\u00b0 and 180\u00b0/s angular velocity. The peak torque and total work values, isokinetic muscle strength differences, and total work difference values were calculated for surgically repaired and healthy knees.\nResults: No significant difference in the mean American Knee Society Score values was observed between the two groups. No significant difference in knee flexion degrees was observed between the two groups. Using isokinetic evaluation, a significant difference was found in the isokinetic muscle strength differences and total work difference of the flexor muscle between the two groups when patients were tested at 180\u00b0/s. Group 2 showed -4.2% change in isokinetic muscle strength differences of the flexor muscle compared to -23.1% in Group 1.\nConclusion: Knee flexion during wound closure was not more effective than knee extension on American Knee Society Score in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.",

Sixty-two patients were randomized to receive topical application of Evicel (N = 31) or not (N = 31). The mean total blood loss was 1.9L(\u0412\u00b1 0.7) in the control group and 1.8L(\u0412\u00b1 0.5) in the treatment group (P = 0.4). The transfusion rate was 32.3% in the control group and 25.8% in the treatment group (P = 0.5). The transfusion rate decreased linearly with increasing preoperative Hb levels in the treatment group (P = 0.005). The results of this study suggest that topical application of this novel fibrin sealant doesn't reduce perioperative blood loss and the need for allogeneic blood transfusion.",

Patients were assigned to either group, with odd-numbered patients going to the knot-tying suture arm and even-numbered patients assigned to the knotless arm. Outcomes included the Constant score, the visual analog scale (VAS) score, patient satisfaction score, and range of motion in forward flexion and external rotation with the arm in adduction.

In the knot-tying suture group, the VAS score improved from 2.5 \u00b1 2.3 to 0.7 \u00b1 0.5 (P < .05) and the Constant score improved from 64 \u00b1 7 to 92 \u00b1 10 (P < .05). In the knotless group, the VAS score improved from 2.8 \u00b1 2.5 to 0.9 \u00b1 0.6 (P < .05), and the Constant score improved from 62 \u00b1 6 to 89 \u00b1 9 (P < .05). The patient satisfaction scores were 6.9 and 7.1 for the knot tying and knotless groups, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found when comparing the outcomes between the 2 groups. The change in the range of forward flexion and external rotation was also similar in the 2 groups. There was also no difference in recurrence or redislocation rates.\n\nConclusions: Both the knot-tying and knotless suture anchors groups showed statistically significant and similar improvement in VAS and Constant scores. Both anchors provided reasonable outcomes. The knotless suture anchor is a good alternative to knot-tying suture anchors so that arthroscopic Bankart repairs can be performed without knot tying.",

However, recent basic science and clinical data have suggested recurrent instability may be reduced with immobilization in external rotation after primary shoulder dislocation.\n\nQuestions/purposes: We performed a randomized controlled trial to compare the (1) frequency of recurrent instability and (2) disease-specific quality-of-life scores after treatment of first-time shoulder dislocation using either immobilization in external rotation or immobilization in internal rotation in a group of young patients.\n\nMethods: Sixty patients younger than 35 years of age with primary, traumatic, anterior shoulder dislocations were randomized (concealed, computer-generated) to immobilization with either an internal rotation sling (n = 29) or an external rotation brace (n = 31) at a mean of 4 days after closed reduction (range, 1-7 days). Patients with large bony lesions or polytrauma were excluded. The two groups were similar at baseline. Both groups were immobilized for 4 weeks with identical therapy protocols thereafter. Blinded assessments were completed by independent observers for a minimum of 12 months (mean, 25 months; range, 12-43 months). The primary outcome was recurrent instability, defined as a second documented anterior dislocation or multiple episodes of shoulder subluxation severe enough for the patient to request surgical stabilization. Secondary outcomes included validated disease-specific quality-of-life data (Western Ontario Shoulder Instability index [WOSI], American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons evaluation [ASES]). Ten patients (17%, five from each group) were lost to followup. Reported compliance with immobilization in both groups was excellent (80%).\n\nResults: There was no difference in the rate of recurrent instability between groups: 10 of 27 patients (37%) with the external rotation brace versus 10 of 25 patients (40%) with the sling redislocated or developed symptomatic recurrent instability (p = 0.41). WOSI scores were not different between groups (p = 0.74). ASES scores were not significantly different between groups (p = 0.05).\n\nConclusions: Immobilization in external rotation was not more effective than sling immobilization in the prevention of recurrent instability after primary anterior shoulder dislocation in patients younger than 35 years of age.",

Recurrent instability was defined as a second documented anterior dislocation or multiple episodes of shoulder subluxation severe enough for the patient to request surgical stabilization. Validated disease-specific quality-of-life data (Western Ontario Shoulder Instability index [WOSI], American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons evaluation [ASES]) were also collected. Ten patients (17%, five from each group) were lost to followup. Reported compliance with immobilization in both groups was excellent (80%).\n\nResults: With the numbers available, there was no difference in the rate of recurrent instability between groups: 10 of 27 patients (37%) with the external rotation brace versus 10 of 25 patients (40%) with the sling redislocated or developed symptomatic recurrent instability (p = 0.41). WOSI scores were not different between groups (p = 0.74) and, although the difference in ASES scores approached statistical significance (p = 0.05), the magnitude of this difference was small and of uncertain clinical importance.\n\nConclusions: Despite previous published findings, our results show immobilization in external rotation did not confer a significant benefit versus sling immobilization in the prevention of recurrent instability after primary anterior shoulder dislocation. Further studies with larger numbers may elucidate whether functional outcomes, compliance, or comfort with immobilization can be improved with this device.",

Eligible patients with \nED nausea and vomiting were randomized to receive 4 mg intravenous ondansetron, \n20 mg intravenous metoclopramide, or saline solution placebo. Primary outcome \nwas mean change in visual analog scale (VAS) rating of nausea severity from \nenrollment to 30 minutes after study drug administration. Secondary outcomes \nincluded patient satisfaction, need for rescue antiemetic treatment, and adverse \nevents.\nRESULTS: Of 270 recruited patients, 258 (95.6%) were available for analysis. Of \nthese patients, 87 (33.7%) received ondansetron; 88 (34.1%), metoclopramide; and \n83 (32.2%), placebo. Baseline characteristics between treatment groups and \nrecruitment site were similar. Mean decrease in VAS score was 27 mm (95% \nconfidence interval [CI] 22 to 33 mm) for ondansetron, 28 mm (95% CI 22 to 34 \nmm) for metoclopramide, and 23 mm (95% CI 16 to 30 mm) for placebo. Satisfaction \nwith treatment was reported by 54.1% (95% CI 43.5% to 64.5%), 61.6% (95% CI \n51.0% to 71.4%), and 59.5% (95% CI 48.4% to 69.9%) for ondansetron, \nmetoclopramide, and placebo, respectively; rescue medication was required by \n34.5% (95% CI 25.0% to 45.1%), 17.9% (95% CI 10.8% to 27.2%), and 36.3% (95% CI \n26.3% to 47.2%), respectively. Nine minor adverse events were reported.\nCONCLUSION: Reductions in nausea severity for this adult ED nausea and vomiting \npopulation were similar for 4 mg intravenous ondansetron, 20 mg intravenous \nmetoclopramide, and placebo. There was a trend toward greater reductions in VAS \nratings and a lesser requirement for rescue medication in the antiemetic drug \ngroups, but differences from the placebo group did not reach significance. The \nmajority of patients in all groups were satisfied with treatment.",

Forty-six patients scheduled for TKA were randomized into two groups: concomitant administration of FNB and SNB or FNB and LIA. Average pain scores during the first 21days after surgery were similar in the two groups and remained at low level. There was no significant difference in the need for adjuvant analgesics, patient satisfaction level, the time to achieve rehabilitation goals, and length of hospital stay. The LIA offers a potentially safer alternative to SNB as an adjunct to FNB.",

The STAND group trained according to a standardised \nrehabilitation protocol. Subjects in the LOW and HIGH group trained as did the \nSTAND group but with the addition of seated knee extensor open kinetic chain \nresistance training at loads of 2 sets of 20 repetition maximum (RM) and 20 sets \nof 2RM, respectively. Anterior knee laxity and measurements of physical and \nsubjective function were performed at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks. Thirty-six \nsubjects were tested at both baseline and 12 weeks (STAND n = 13, LOW n = 11, \nHIGH n = 12).\nRESULTS: The LOW group demonstrated a reduction in 133 N anterior knee laxity \nbetween baseline and 12 weeks testing when compared to the HIGH and the STAND \ngroups (p = 0.009). Specifically, the trained-untrained knee laxity decreased an \naverage of approximately 5 mm in the LOW group while remaining the same in the \nother two groups.\nCONCLUSION: Twelve weeks of knee extensor open kinetic chain resistance training \nat loads of 2 sets of 20RM led to a reduction in anterior knee laxity in the \nACLI knee. This reduction in laxity does not appear to offer any significant \nshort-term functional advantages when compared to a standard rehabilitation \nprotocol. These results indicate that knee laxity can be decreased with \nresistance training of the thigh muscles.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency technology for shoulder instability was rapidly \nadopted despite limited clinical evidence and a poor understanding of its \nindications. Reports of serious adverse events followed, leading to its \nabandonment. This paper presents findings from a multicenter randomized clinical \ntrial evaluating the safety and efficacy of electrothermal arthroscopic \ncapsulorrhaphy (ETAC) compared with open inferior capsular shift (ICS).\nMETHODS: Patients (>14 years) diagnosed with multidirectional instability or \nmultidirectional laxity with anteroinferior instability and failed nonoperative \ntreatment were enrolled. Patients with bone lesions or labral, biceps anchor, or \nfull-thickness rotator cuff tears were excluded intraoperatively. The primary \noutcome was the Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index at 2 years \npostoperatively. Secondary outcomes included American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons \nscore, Constant score, active range of motion, recurrent instability, and \nsurgical times.\nRESULTS: Fifty-four subjects (mean age, 23 years; 37 women) were randomized to \nETAC (n = 28) or open ICS (n = 26). The groups were comparable at baseline, \nexcept for external rotation at the side. At 2 years postoperatively, there were \nno statistically significant differences between groups for the Western Ontario \nShoulder Instability Index (P = .71), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score \n(P = .43), Constant score (P = .43), and active range of motion. Recurrent \ninstability was not statistically different (ETAC, 2; open, 4; P = .41). ETAC \n(23 minutes) was significantly shorter than open ICS (59 minutes) (P < .01) \nsurgery. Three subjects (1 ETAC, 2 open) had stiff shoulders.\nCONCLUSIONS: ETAC was not more effective on the Western Ontario Shoulder \nInstability Index than open ICS in patients with multidirectional shoulder \ninstability.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency technology for shoulder instability was rapidly \nadopted despite limited clinical evidence and a poor understanding of its \nindications. Reports of serious adverse events followed, leading to its \nabandonment. This paper presents findings from a multicenter randomized clinical \ntrial evaluating the safety and efficacy of electrothermal arthroscopic \ncapsulorrhaphy (ETAC) compared with open inferior capsular shift (ICS) and \nreviews the role of randomized trials in adopting new technology.\nMETHODS: Patients (>14\u0412\u00a0years) diagnosed with multidirectional instability or \nmultidirectional laxity with anteroinferior instability and failed nonoperative \ntreatment were enrolled. Patients with bone lesions or labral, biceps anchor, or \nfull-thickness rotator cuff tears were excluded intraoperatively. Outcomes \nincluded Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index, function and recurrent \ninstability at 2 years postoperatively, and surgical times.\nRESULTS: Fifty-four subjects (mean age, 23\u0412\u00a0years; 37 women) were randomized to \nETAC (n\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a028) or open ICS (n\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a026). The groups were comparable at baseline, \nexcept for external rotation at the side. At 2 years postoperatively, there were \nno statistically or clinically significant differences between groups for the \nWestern Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (P\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a0.71), American Shoulder and \nElbow Surgeons score (P\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a0.43), Constant score (P\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a0.43), and active range of \nmotion. Recurrent instability was not statistically different (ETAC,\u0412\u00a02; open,\u0412\u00a04; \nP\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a0.41). ETAC (23\u0412\u00a0minutes) was significantly shorter than open ICS (59\u0412\u00a0minutes) \n(P\u0412\u00a0<\u0412\u00a0.01) surgery. Three subjects (1 ETAC, 2 open) had stiff shoulders.\nCONCLUSIONS: At 2 years postoperatively, quality of life and functional outcomes \nbetween groups were not clinically different. ETAC had fewer complications and \nepisodes of recurrence compared with open surgery. This evidence reinforces the \nneed to critically evaluate new technology before widespread clinical use.",

In the control \ngroup, no electrical stimulation was applied. The primary outcome was the incidence of DVT assessed by ultrasonography on post-operative day (POD) 1. Secondary outcomes included serum D-dimer and soluble fibrin monomer complex (SFMC) levels measured before surgery, immediately after surgery, and POD 1.\nRESULTS: The incidence of DVT was 11% (5/45 cases) in the TENS group and 31% (14/45 cases) in the control group (p = 0.02). Immediately after surgery, D-dimer and SFMC levels were lower in the TENS group compared with control (p < 0.05).

Previously, we reported effective \nprevention of venous stasis by transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation \n(TENS). It is hypothesized that TENS might be a thromboprophylactic tool for the \nlimb undergoing surgery. The purpose of this study is to clarify the clinical \nefficacy and safety of TENS in patients during total knee arthroplasty (TKA).\nMETHODS: Ninety patients undergoing primary TKA were involved and randomly \nallocated to the TENS or control group. In the TENS group, electrical \nstimulation of the common fibular nerve, which produced a brisk dorsiflexion of \nthe ankle, was performed for the operated leg during surgery.

There were no adverse effects related to TENS.\nCONCLUSIONS: TENS during TKA showed significant effects on preventing DVT. \nSustaining muscle pump activation during surgery prevented not only venous \nstasis, but also hypercoagulability of blood. Intraoperative TENS is a safe and \nnovel strategy against early post-operative thromboembolism, which is difficult \nto be completed through existing prophylaxis after total joint arthroplasty.",

All patients received the same cementless prosthetic \ncomponents through an anterolateral MIS approach while they were in a lateral \ndecubitus position. Leg length, global or total offset (representing the \ncombination of femoral and acetabular offset), and femoral offset differences \nwere restored using either navigation or fluoroscopy. Postoperatively, residual \nleg length and global and femoral offset discrepancies were analyzed on \nmagnification-corrected radiographs of the pelvis by an independent and blinded \nexaminer using digital planning software. Accuracy was defined as the relative \npostoperative difference between the surgically treated and the unaffected \ncontralateral side for leg length and offset, respectively; precision was \ndefined as the absolute postoperative deviation of leg length and global and \nfemoral offset regardless of lengthening or shortening of leg length and offset \nthroughout the THA.

We \naimed to investigate whether antivenom resulted in resolution of pain and \nsystemic effects in patients with latrodectism who received standardized \nanalgesia.\nMETHODS: In a multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial of redback spider \nantivenom for latrodectism, 224 patients (>7 years) with a redback spider bite \nand severe pain, with or without systemic effects, were randomized to receive \nnormal saline solution (placebo) or antivenom after receiving standardized \nanalgesia. The primary outcome was a clinically significant reduction in pain 2 \nhours after trial medication compared with baseline. A second primary outcome \nwas resolution of systemic features at 2 hours. Secondary outcomes were improved pain at 4 and 24 \nhours, resolution of systemic features at 4 hours, administration of opioid \nanalgesics or unblinded antivenom after 2 hours, and adverse reactions.\nRESULTS: Two hours after treatment, 26 of 112 patients (23%) from the placebo \narm had a clinically significant improvement in pain versus 38 of 112 (34%) from \nthe antivenom arm (difference in favor of antivenom 10.7%; 95% confidence \ninterval -1.1% to 22.6%; P=.10). Systemic effects resolved after 2 hours in 9 of \n41 patients (22%) in the placebo arm and 9 of 35 (26%) in the antivenom arm \n(difference 3.8%; 95% confidence interval -15% to 23%; P=.79). There was no \nsignificant difference in any secondary outcome between antivenom and placebo. \nAcute systemic hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 4 of 112 patients (3.6%) \nreceiving antivenom.\nCONCLUSION: Antivenom was not more effective than placebo on pain reduction in patients with \nlatrodectism.",

        "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: Latrodectism is the most important spider envenomation syndrome \nworldwide. There remains considerable controversy over antivenom treatment. We \naimed to investigate whether antivenom resulted in resolution of pain and \nsystemic effects in patients with latrodectism who received standardized \nanalgesia.\nMETHODS: In a multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial of redback spider \nantivenom for latrodectism, 224 patients (>7 years) with a redback spider bite \nand severe pain, with or without systemic effects, were randomized to receive \nnormal saline solution (placebo) or antivenom after receiving standardized \nanalgesia. The primary outcome was a clinically significant reduction in pain 2 \nhours after trial medication compared with baseline. A second primary outcome \nfor the subgroup with systemic features of envenomation was resolution of \nsystemic features at 2 hours. Secondary outcomes were improved pain at 4 and 24 \nhours, resolution of systemic features at 4 hours, administration of opioid \nanalgesics or unblinded antivenom after 2 hours, and adverse reactions.\nRESULTS: Two hours after treatment, 26 of 112 patients (23%) from the placebo \narm had a clinically significant improvement in pain versus 38 of 112 (34%) from \nthe antivenom arm (difference in favor of antivenom 10.7%; 95% confidence \ninterval -1.1% to 22.6%; P=.10). Systemic effects resolved after 2 hours in 9 of \n41 patients (22%) in the placebo arm and 9 of 35 (26%) in the antivenom arm \n(difference 3.8%; 95% confidence interval -15% to 23%; P=.79). There was no \nsignificant difference in any secondary outcome between antivenom and placebo. \nAcute systemic hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 4 of 112 patients (3.6%) \nreceiving antivenom.\nCONCLUSION: The addition of antivenom to standardized analgesia in patients with \nlatrodectism did not significantly improve pain or systemic effects.",

Ninety emergency department patients with moderate to severe pain aged 15 to 50 years were blocked randomized and enrolled in this study. Forty-seven patients in the experimental group received nebulized fentanyl (4\u0412\u00a0\u041e\u0458g/kg) and IV normal saline as placebo, and the remaining 43 patients in the control group received IV morphine (0.1 mg/kg) and nebulized normal saline as placebo.

Patients' vital sign and possible\u0412\u00a0adverse effects\u0412\u00a0were recorded respectively. Finally, all participants were assessed for their satisfaction.\nResults\nThe mean initial pain score in the experimental group was 8.7 and 8.4 in the control group (P\u0412\u00a0= .1). Pain relief in both groups after 5 and 10 minutes were similar (P\u0412\u00a0= .72). Although the pain relief was significantly greater with fentanyl at 15 minutes, this difference is not clinically significant. Pain management in both groups was successful and was more than 3 scores reduction in Numerical Rating Scale. Patient satisfaction in both groups was similar. No adverse effects were reported in the experimental group.\nConclusion\nThis study suggests that nebulized fentanyl is a rapid, safe, and effective method for temporary control of acute limb pain in emergency department patients.",

The primary \nendpoint was defined as meeting predetermined discharge eligibility criteria \nwithin 6 hours of study drug administration. Discharge criteria included \nimprovement of edema, stable vital signs, absence of stridor, absence of dyspnea \nor use of accessory muscles during respiration, absence of drooling, and ability \nto drink without difficulty.\nRESULTS: An interim analysis showed that a high percentage of subjects met the \nprimary endpoint, and the study was halted. Overall, 79 subjects were randomized \nand 76 had data for analysis. Most had mild (45%) or moderate (42%) ACEIA. The \ndischarge eligibility endpoint was met by 72% of the placebo group and 85%, 89%, \nand 89% of the ecallantide 10-, 30-, and 60-mg groups, respectively. This \ndifference in meeting discharge eligibility endpoint criteria between treatment \ngroups was not statistically significant. The incidence of treatment-emergent \nadverse events was similar between placebo and active-treatment groups.\nCONCLUSION: The addition of ecallantide to standard therapy does not appear to \nimprove angioedema compared with placebo in ED patients with ACEIA. Our data \nsuggest that most ED patients presenting with mild to moderate ACEIA are likely \nto meet our discharge eligibility criteria within 6 hours of treatment, \nregardless of intervention. Further studies to assess the utility of ecallantide \nin patients with more severe angioedema may be useful. No new safety signals \nrelated to ecallantide administration were identified.",

The US \nneedling group underwent US-guided needling and received a subacromial \ncorticosteroid injection. The ESWT group received ESWT 3 times a week. All \npatients were prospectively evaluated; American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, \nSimple Shoulder Test, and visual analog scale for pain scores were recorded \nbefore the procedure and at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, and the last \nfollow-up. The size and morphology of the deposits were evaluated by \nradiography.\nRESULTS: The average follow-up period was 23.0 months. At last follow-up, the \nmean size of the deposits decreased to 0.5 mm from 14.8 mm in the US needling \ngroup and to 5.6 mm from 11.0 mm in the ESWT group (P = .001). At 1-year \nfollow-up, the US needling group had American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons \nassessment scores of 90.3 compared to 74.6 in the ESWT group (P = .001), Simple \nShoulder Test scores of 83.3 compared to 70.8 (P = .015), and visual analog \nscale for pain scores of 1.4 compared to 3.3 (P = .003). The initial calcium \ndeposit sizes and clinical outcomes were weakly correlated in both groups (P > \n.05).\nCONCLUSION: US-guided needling treatment was more effective than ESWT in patients \nwith calcific tendinitis of the shoulder.",

The US \nneedling group underwent US-guided needling and received a subacromial \ncorticosteroid injection. The ESWT group received ESWT 3 times a week. All \npatients were prospectively evaluated; American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, \nSimple Shoulder Test, and visual analog scale for pain scores were recorded \nbefore the procedure and at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, and the last \nfollow-up. The size and morphology of the deposits were evaluated by \nradiography.\nRESULTS: The average follow-up period was 23.0 months. At last follow-up, the \nmean size of the deposits was significantly different between the 2 groups (P = \n.001); it decreased to 0.5 mm from 14.8 mm in the US needling group and to 5.6 \nmm from 11.0 mm in the ESWT group. There were also significant improvements in \nclinical outcomes in both groups after treatment (P < .05). At 1-year follow-up, \nthe US needling group had significantly better scores than the ESWT group with \nregard to the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons assessment (90.3 and 74.6, \nrespectively; P = .001), Simple Shoulder Test (83.3 and 70.8, respectively; P = \n.015), and visual analog scale for pain (1.4 and 3.3, respectively; P = \n.003).The initial calcium deposit sizes and clinical outcomes were weakly \ncorrelated in both groups (P > .05).\nCONCLUSION: Both treatment modalities for calcific tendinitis improved clinical \noutcomes and eliminated calcium deposits. US-guided needling treatment, however, \nwas more effective in function restoration and pain relief in the short term.",

We \nexamined the ability of 1 dose of benralizumab, an investigational \nantiinterleukin 5 receptor \u041e\u00b1 monoclonal antibody, to reduce recurrence after \nacute asthma exacerbations.\nMETHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, eligible \nsubjects presented to the ED with an asthma exacerbation, had partial response \nto treatment, and greater than or equal to 1 additional exacerbation within the \nprevious year. Subjects received 1 intravenous infusion of placebo (n = 38) or \nbenralizumab (0.3 mg/kg, n = 36 or 1.0 mg/kg, n = 36) added to outpatient \nmanagement. The primary outcome was the proportion of subjects with greater than \nor equal to 1 exacerbation at 12 weeks in placebo vs the combined benralizumab \ngroups. Other outcomes included the time-weighted rate of exacerbations at week \n12, adverse events, blood eosinophil counts, asthma symptom changes, and health \ncare resource utilization.\nRESULTS: The proportion of subjects with greater than or equal to 1 asthma \nexacerbation at 12 weeks was not different between placebo and the combined \nbenralizumab groups (38.9% vs 33.3%; P = .67). However, compared with placebo, \nbenralizumab reduced asthma exacerbation rates by 49% (3.59 vs 1.82; P = .01) \nand exacerbations resulting in hospitalization by 60% (1.62 vs 0.65; P = .02) in \nthe combined groups. Benralizumab reduced blood eosinophil counts but did not \naffect other outcomes, while demonstrating an acceptable safety profile.\nCONCLUSIONS: When added to usual care, 1 dose of benralizumab reduced the rate \nand severity of exacerbations experienced over 12 weeks by subjects who \npresented to the ED with acute asthma.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: To compare the maximum change in numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores, in patients receiving low-dose ketamine (LDK) or morphine (MOR) for acute pain in the emergency department.\n\nMethods: We performed an institutional review board-approved, randomized, prospective, double-blinded trial at a tertiary, level 1 trauma center. A convenience sample of patients aged 18 to 59 years with acute abdominal, flank, low back, or extremity pain were enrolled. Subjects were consented and randomized to intravenous LDK (0.3mg/kg) or intravenous MOR (0.1mg/kg). Our primary outcome was the maximum change in NRS scores. Secondary outcomes included time to achieve maximum reduction in NRS pain scores, vital signs, adverse events, and provider and nurse satisfaction scores. A sample size of 20 subjects per group was calculated based on an 80% power to detect a 2-point change in NRS scores between treatment groups with estimated SDs of 2 and an \u03b1 of .05, using a repeated-measures linear model.\n\nResults: Forty-five subjects were enrolled (MOR 21, LDK 24). Demographic variables and baseline NRS scores (7.1 vs 7.1) were similar. Ketamine was not superior to MOR in the maximum change of NRS pain scores, MOR=5 (confidence interval, 6.6-3.5) and LDK=4.9 (confidence interval, 5.8-4). The time to achieve maximum reduction in NRS pain scores was at 5 minutes for LDK and 100 minutes for MOR. Vital signs, adverse events, provider, and nurse satisfaction scores were similar between groups.\n\nConclusion: Low-dose ketamine was not more effective on maximum change in NRS pain scores than morphine in patients with acute pain in the emergency department.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: To compare the maximum change in numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores, in patients receiving low-dose ketamine (LDK) or morphine (MOR) for acute pain in the emergency department.\n\nMethods: We performed an institutional review board-approved, randomized, prospective, double-blinded trial at a tertiary, level 1 trauma center. A convenience sample of patients aged 18 to 59 years with acute abdominal, flank, low back, or extremity pain were enrolled. Subjects were consented and randomized to intravenous LDK (0.3mg/kg) or intravenous MOR (0.1mg/kg). Our primary outcome was the maximum change in NRS scores. A sample size of 20 subjects per group was calculated based on an 80% power to detect a 2-point change in NRS scores between treatment groups with estimated SDs of 2 and an _ of .05, using a repeated-measures linear model.\n\nResults: Forty-five subjects were enrolled (MOR 21, LDK 24). Demographic variables and baseline NRS scores (7.1 vs 7.1) were similar. Ketamine was not superior to MOR in the maximum change of NRS pain scores, MOR=5 (confidence interval, 6.6-3.5) and LDK=4.9 (confidence interval, 5.8-4). The time to achieve maximum reduction in NRS pain scores was at 5 minutes for LDK and 100 minutes for MOR. Vital signs, adverse events, provider, and nurse satisfaction scores were similar between groups.\n\nConclusion: Low-dose ketamine did not produce a greater reduction in NRS pain scores compared with MOR for acute pain in the emergency department. However, LDK induced a significant analgesic effect within 5 minutes and provided a moderate reduction in pain for 2 hours.",

Delayed initiation of neuroprotective agents has hindered earlier phase 3 trials of neuroprotective agents.\n\nMethods: We randomly assigned patients with suspected stroke to receive either intravenous magnesium sulfate or placebo, beginning within 2 hours after symptom onset. A loading dose was initiated by paramedics before the patient arrived at the hospital, and a 24-hour maintenance infusion was started on the patient's arrival at the hospital. The primary outcome was the degree of disability at 90 days, as measured by scores on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater disability).\n\nResults: Among the 1700 enrolled patients (857 in the magnesium group and 843 in the placebo group), the mean (\u00b1SD) age was 69\u00b113 years, 42.6% were women, and the mean pretreatment score on the Los Angeles Motor Scale of stroke severity (range, 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater motor deficits) was 3.7\u00b11.3. The final diagnosis of the qualifying event was cerebral ischemia in 73.3% of patients, intracranial hemorrhage in 22.8%, and a stroke-mimicking condition in 3.9%. The median interval between the time the patient was last known to be free of stroke symptoms and the start of the study-drug infusion was 45 minutes (interquartile range, 35 to 62), and 74.3% of patients received the study-drug infusion within the first hour after symptom onset. There was no significant shift in the distribution of 90-day disability outcomes on the global modified Rankin scale between patients in the magnesium group and those in the placebo group (P=0.28 by the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test); mean scores at 90 days did not differ between the magnesium group and the placebo group (2.7 in each group, P=1.00). No significant between-group differences were noted with respect to mortality (15.4% in the magnesium group and 15.5% in the placebo group, P=0.95) or all serious adverse events.\n\nConclusions: Prehospital initiation of magnesium sulfate therapy was safe and allowed the start of therapy within 2 hours after the onset of stroke symptoms, but it did not improve disability outcomes at 90 days.",

No significant between-group differences were noted with respect to all serious adverse events.\n\nConclusions: Magnesium sulfate was not more effective than placebo in patients with suspected stroke.",

To increase the likelihood that good alignment will be achieved during surgery, smart tools such as robotics or patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) have been introduced.\nQuestions/purposes:\u0412\u00a0We hypothesized that UKA performed with PSI would result in improved level gait as ascertained with three-dimensional analysis, implant positioning, and patient-reported outcomes measured by a validated scoring system when compared with conventional instrumentation 3 months and 1 year after surgery.\nMethods:\u0412\u00a0We randomized 60 patients into two groups using either the PSI technique or a conventional technique. All patients were operated on using the same technique and the same cemented metal-backed implant. Mean age of the patients was 63 \u0412\u00b1 4 years (range, 54-72 years) and mean body mass index was 28 \u0412\u00b1 3 kg/m(2). Patients were evaluated preoperatively, at 3 months, and 1 year after surgery by an independent observer blind to the type of technique. Gait parameters were assessed with three-dimensional analysis during level walking preoperatively and at 1 year, frontal and sagittal position of the implant was evaluated on full-length radiographs at 3 months, and subjective functional outcome and quality of life using routine questionnaires (SF-12, new Knee Society Score [KSS], Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) at 3 months and 1 year. This study had 80% power to detect a 15% difference in walking speed at the p < 0.05 level.\nResults:\u0412\u00a0One year after surgery, there were no differences between the two groups in the analyzed gait spatiotemporal parameters, respectively, for PSI UKA and conventional UKA : double limb support 31% (25%-54%) versus 30% (23%-56%; p = 0.67) and walking speed (1.59 m/s [0.86-1.87 m/s] versus 1.57 m/s [0.71-1.96 m/s]; p = 0.41). No difference was observed between the two groups in terms of lower limb alignment (PSI group 178\u0412\u00b0 \u0412\u00b1 3\u0412\u00b0, conventional group 178\u0412\u00b0 \u0412\u00b1 4\u0412\u00b0; p = 0.24) or implant positioning on mediolateral and anteroposterior radiographs. There were no differences in the functional score between the PSI and conventional TKA groups at 3 months and 1 year after surgery: KSS objective knee scores (PSI: 85 \u0412\u00b1 8 points at 3 months, 87 \u0412\u00b1 5 points at 1 year and conventional instrumentation: 82 \u0412\u00b1 8 points at 3 months 83 \u0412\u00b1 6 points at 1 year; p = 0.10) and functional activity scores were similar in both group (PSI: 71 \u0412\u00b1 12 points at 3 months and 74 \u0412\u00b1 7 points at 1 year versus conventional group: 73 \u0412\u00b1 11 points at 3 months and 75 \u0412\u00b1 6 at 1 year; p = 0.9).\nConclusions:\u0412\u00a0Our observations suggest that PSI may confer small, if any, advantage in alignment, pain, or function after UKA. This argument can therefore not be used to justify the extra cost and uncertainty related to this technique.",

Patients were randomized to receive ketamine \nat 0.3 mg/kg or morphine at 0.1 mg/kg by intravenous push during 3 to 5 minutes. \nEvaluations occurred at 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes.

There is \nno standardised protocol for post-operative rehabilitation available. The \npurpose of this study was to compare two post-operative rehabilitation protocols \nafter open wedge HTO.\nMETHODS: One hundred and twenty consecutive patients with varus malalignment and \nmedial compartment osteoarthritis received an open wedge HTO using an angular \nlocking plate fixation between December 2008 and December 2011. All patients \nwere assigned randomly into one of two groups with different post-operative \nrehabilitation protocols (11-day vs. 6-week 20-kg partial weight-bearing). \nClinical outcome was evaluated using established instruments (Lequesne, Lysholm, \nHSS and IKDC scores) preoperatively, 6, 12 and 18 months post-operatively. \nDeformity analysis was performed preoperatively and during follow-up.\nRESULTS: All clinical scores showed a significant pre- to post-operative \nimprovement. After 6 months, there was a higher improvement in the group of \nearly full weight-bearing. The difference between preoperative and 6-month \nfollow-up for the group with early full weight-bearing and for the group with \n20-kg PWB for 6 weeks was 28 \u00b1 26 and 18 \u00b1 22, respectively, for the Lysholm \nscore and -5.0 \u00b1 5.1 and -3.0 \u00b1 3.6, respectively, for the Lequesne score.\nCONCLUSIONS: The study did not establish a clear primary outcome measure to \ndefinitively determine whether early full weight-bearing was more effective than \n6-week partial weight-bearing in patients with varus malalignment and medial \ncompartment osteoarthritis undergoing open wedge HTO.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Open wedge high tibial osteotomy is a widespread treatment option in \npatients with varus malalignment and medial compartment osteoarthritis. There is \nno standardised protocol for post-operative rehabilitation available. The \npurpose of this study was to compare two post-operative rehabilitation protocols \nand to evaluate the clinical outcome of early full weight-bearing after open \nwedge HTO.\nMETHODS: One hundred and twenty consecutive patients with varus malalignment and \nmedial compartment osteoarthritis received an open wedge HTO using an angular \nlocking plate fixation between December 2008 and December 2011. All patients \nwere assigned randomly into one of two groups with different post-operative \nrehabilitation protocols (11-day vs. 6-week 20-kg partial weight-bearing). \nClinical outcome was evaluated using established instruments (Lequesne, Lysholm, \nHSS and IKDC scores) preoperatively, 6, 12 and 18\u0412\u00a0months post-operatively. \nDeformity analysis was performed preoperatively and during follow-up.\nRESULTS: All clinical scores showed a significant pre- to post-operative \nimprovement. After 6\u0412\u00a0months, there was a higher improvement in the group of \nearly full weight-bearing. The difference between preoperative and 6-month \nfollow-up for the group with early full weight-bearing and for the group with \n20-kg PWB for 6\u0412\u00a0weeks was 28\u0412\u00a0\u0412\u00b1\u0412\u00a026 and 18\u0412\u00a0\u0412\u00b1\u0412\u00a022, respectively, for the Lysholm \nscore and -5.0\u0412\u00a0\u0412\u00b1\u0412\u00a05.1 and -3.0\u0412\u00a0\u0412\u00b1\u0412\u00a03.6, respectively, for the Lequesne score.\nCONCLUSIONS: Early full weight-bearing (11-day 20-kg partial weight-bearing) \nafter open wedge HTO without bone graft leads to earlier improvement of the \nclinical results and can be recommended for post-operative rehabilitation after \nopen wedge HTO and fixation with an angular locking plate.",

Febrile children were randomly assigned to the intervention (clinical \ndecision model; n = 219) or the control group (usual care; n = 220). The \nclinical decision model included clinical symptoms, vital signs, and C-reactive \nprotein and provided high/low-risks for \"pneumonia\" and \"other SBI\". Nurses were \nguided by the intervention to initiate additional tests for high-risk children. \nThe clinical decision model was evaluated by 1) \narea-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic-curve (AUC) to indicate \ndiscriminative ability and 2) feasibility, to measure nurses' compliance to \nmodel recommendations. Primary patient outcome was defined as correct SBI \ndiagnoses. Secondary process outcomes were defined as length of stay; diagnostic \ntests; antibiotic treatment; hospital admission; revisits and medical costs.\nRESULTS: The decision model had discriminative ability for both pneumonia \n(n = 33; AUC 0.83 (95% CI 0.75-0.90)) and other SBI (n = 22; AUC 0.81 (95% CI \n0.72-0.90)). Compliance to model recommendations was 86%. No differences \nin correct SBI determination were observed. Application of the clinical decision \nmodel resulted in less full-blood counts (14% vs. 22%, p-value < 0.05) and more \nurine-dipstick testing (71% vs. 61%, p-value < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: The clinical decision model was not more effective than usual care \nfor correct SBI diagnoses in febrile children attending the emergency department.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of a clinical decision model for febrile \nchildren at risk for serious bacterial infections (SBI) attending the emergency \ndepartment (ED).\nMETHODS: Randomized controlled trial with 439 febrile children, aged 1 month-16 \nyears, attending the pediatric ED of a Dutch university hospital during \n2010-2012. Febrile children were randomly assigned to the intervention (clinical \ndecision model; n = 219) or the control group (usual care; n = 220). The \nclinical decision model included clinical symptoms, vital signs, and C-reactive \nprotein and provided high/low-risks for \"pneumonia\" and \"other SBI\". Nurses were \nguided by the intervention to initiate additional tests for high-risk children. \nThe clinical decision model was evaluated by 1) \narea-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic-curve (AUC) to indicate \ndiscriminative ability and 2) feasibility, to measure nurses' compliance to \nmodel recommendations. Primary patient outcome was defined as correct SBI \ndiagnoses. Secondary process outcomes were defined as length of stay; diagnostic \ntests; antibiotic treatment; hospital admission; revisits and medical costs.\nRESULTS: The decision model had good discriminative ability for both pneumonia \n(n = 33; AUC 0.83 (95% CI 0.75-0.90)) and other SBI (n = 22; AUC 0.81 (95% CI \n0.72-0.90)). Compliance to model recommendations was high (86%). No differences \nin correct SBI determination were observed. Application of the clinical decision \nmodel resulted in less full-blood-counts (14% vs. 22%, p-value < 0.05) and more \nurine-dipstick testing (71% vs. 61%, p-value < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: In contrast to our expectations no substantial impact on patient \noutcome was perceived. The clinical decision model preserved, however, good \ndiscriminatory ability to detect SBI, achieved good compliance among nurses and \nresulted in a more standardized diagnostic approach towards febrile children, \nwith less full blood-counts and more rightfully urine-dipstick testing.",

        "abstract": "New insert types have been developed to improve clinical and functional outcome in mobile bearing (MB-TKA) and fixed bearing total knee arthroplasty (FB-TKA). A prospective single blinded randomised controlled clinical trial was performed to evaluate 2 types of MB-TKA inserts and 2 types of FB-TKA inserts of the Genesis II prosthesis (Smith & Nephew) in 146 patients with 5-years follow-up. A significant difference (P=.042) between the MB-TKA inserts was found in KSS function scores, but clinical significance is expected to be limited. Goniometry, temporal gait parameters and QoL were similar in all groups. Survival was significantly better (P=.047) for FB-TKA. The comparable outcome and higher revision rate in MB-TKA indicate that FB-TKA may be preferential for the Genesis II implant system.",

A prospective single blinded randomised controlled clinical trial was performed to evaluate 2 types of MB-TKA inserts and 2 types of FB-TKA inserts of the Genesis II prosthesis (Smith & Nephew) in 146 patients with 5-years follow-up. A difference (P=.042) between the MB-TKA inserts was found in KSS function scores. Goniometry, temporal gait parameters and QoL were similar in all groups. Survival was different (P=.047) for FB-TKA with higher revision rate in MB-TKA. The study found differences between insert types in KSS function scores and survival rates, with higher revision rates observed in MB-TKA compared to FB-TKA for the Genesis II implant system.",

Recent studies have \ndescribed a positive effect of lateralization of the center of rotation, \nespecially on postoperative rotational function. The goal of this study is to \ncompare the outcome of non-lateralized versus lateralized RSA with particular \nregard to rotational function in patients with CTA.\nMETHODS: Thirty-four patients underwent implantation of RSA either with \nlateralization (n\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a017) or without lateralization (n\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a017) by use of a 1-cm \nautologous bone graft (\"bony increased offset\") of the humeral head for CTA. \nClinical outcomes were measured with the Constant score; the Disabilities of the \nArm, Shoulder and Hand score; and the Activities of Daily Living \nRequiring\u0412\u00a0External Rotation score, as well as measurement of external rotation \nand determination of the external rotation lag sign with the arm at the side and \nat 90\u0412\u00b0 of abduction, at 1 year postoperatively and at final follow-up. Computed \ntomography scan evaluation was performed in all patients preoperatively and at 1 \nyear postoperatively to assess preoperative fatty infiltration of the rotator \ncuff and bony integration of the graft postoperatively.\nRESULTS: At final follow-up, all patients showed significantly increased \nfunctional results.

It also \nevaluates the need for additional doses of analgesics in the first 24 hours of \ndischarge from emergency department (ED).\nMETHODS: Adult (>18 years old) patients with soft tissue injuries were enrolled \nin a teaching urban ED. Subjects were randomly allocated to receive a single \ndose of oral oxycodone (5 mg) or oral naproxen (250 mg). Pain scores and drugs' \nadverse effects were assessed before, 30 minutes, and 60 minutes after \nmedication.\nOUTCOME: efficacy in pain control (reduction in pain scale >2 points) and safety \n(rate of side effects). The need for additional pain medication after discharge \nwas assessed by follow-up phone call 24 hours after discharge.\nRESULTS: A total of 150 patients were enrolled.

Twelve (16.0%) patients in oral oxycodone group and 5 \n(6.6%) patients in naproxen group needed more analgesics in first 24 hours after \nED discharge. Adverse effects were more common in oxycodone group (statistically \nsignificant difference). The most common adverse effects in oxycodone group were \nnausea, (13.3%); vomiting, (8.0%); dizziness, (5.3%); drowsiness, 3 (4.0%); and \npruritis, (2.7%).\nCONCLUSION: Oral oxycodone is as effective as naproxen in soft tissue injury \npain control but has a less favorable safety profile.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Arthroscopy has become a standard method of treatment for a variety \nof intra-articular hip disorders. While most arthroscopic hip procedures are \nperformed as outpatient surgeries, patients can still experience significant \npostoperative pain and opioid-associated side effects.\nPURPOSE: The potential benefits of a preoperative femoral nerve block (FNB) in \nhip arthroscopy were explored in a previous retrospective review. The study \nobjective was to confirm these findings in a prospective randomized study.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\nMETHODS: Fifty patients undergoing hip arthroscopy were included in this \nprospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial that was patient-, \noperator-, and assessor-blinded. Patients received either a preoperative \nultrasound-guided FNB with 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine (FNB group) or normal \nsaline (control group). Nerve blockade was confirmed via standardized sensory \ntesting before the induction of general anesthesia. The primary endpoint was \ncumulative consumption of oral morphine equivalent at 24 hours after discharge. \nSecondary endpoints included opioid use at various time points, pain scores, \nQuality of Recovery (QoR-27) score, incidence of nausea and vomiting, time to \ndischarge, block-related complications, falls at 24 hours, and patient \nsatisfaction.\nRESULTS: Fifty patients completed the study, including 27 in the FNB group and \n23 in the control group. Most patient characteristics were statistically similar \nbetween groups except for operative time, which was longer in the control group. \nCumulative oral morphine consumption was lower in the FNB group at 48 hours; \nthere was no difference at 24 hours or 7 days postoperatively. Pain scores were \nsignificantly lower up to 6 hours postoperatively in the FNB group compared with \ncontrol; however, rebound pain was observed at 24 hours after discharge in \npatients who received FNB. There was no difference in most secondary outcomes. \nImportantly, a total of 6 patients in the FNB group reported falls (without \ninjury) within the first 24 hours postoperatively compared with none in the \ncontrol group. Patient satisfaction with pain control was high in both groups at \nall time points.\nCONCLUSION: Preoperative FNB may improve early pain control after hip \narthroscopy. However, given the observed risk of falls, the routine use of FNB \nfor outpatient hip arthroscopy cannot be recommended.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Arthroscopy has become a standard method of treatment for a variety \nof intra-articular hip disorders. While most arthroscopic hip procedures are \nperformed as outpatient surgeries, patients can still experience significant \npostoperative pain and opioid-associated side effects.\nPURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of preoperative femoral nerve block (FNB) compared to placebo in patients undergoing hip arthroscopy.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\nMETHODS: Fifty patients undergoing hip arthroscopy were included in this \nprospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial that was patient-, \noperator-, and assessor-blinded. Patients received either a preoperative \nultrasound-guided FNB with 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine (FNB group) or normal \nsaline (control group). Nerve blockade was confirmed via standardized sensory \ntesting before the induction of general anesthesia. The primary endpoint was \ncumulative consumption of oral morphine equivalent at 24 hours after discharge. \nSecondary endpoints included opioid use at various time points, pain scores, \nQuality of Recovery (QoR-27) score, incidence of nausea and vomiting, time to \ndischarge, block-related complications, falls at 24 hours, and patient \nsatisfaction.\nRESULTS: Fifty patients completed the study, including 27 in the FNB group and \n23 in the control group. Most patient characteristics were statistically similar \nbetween groups except for operative time, which was longer in the control group. \nThere was no difference in cumulative oral morphine consumption at 24 hours between groups. Cumulative oral morphine consumption was lower in the FNB group at 48 hours; \nthere was no difference at 7 days postoperatively. Pain scores were \nsignificantly lower up to 6 hours postoperatively in the FNB group compared with \ncontrol; however, rebound pain was observed at 24 hours after discharge in \npatients who received FNB. There was no difference in most secondary outcomes. \nA total of 6 patients in the FNB group reported falls (without \ninjury) within the first 24 hours postoperatively compared with none in the \ncontrol group. Patient satisfaction with pain control was high in both groups at \nall time points.\nCONCLUSION: Preoperative FNB was not more effective than placebo on cumulative oral morphine consumption at 24 hours in patients undergoing hip arthroscopy.",

        "abstract": "Background: Olecranon bursitis might be a minor problem in the outpatient clinic but relatively be common to occur. However, there are few well-designed studies comparing approaches to treatment.\n\nQuestions/purposes: (1) Which treatment (compression bandaging with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], aspiration, or aspiration with steroid injections) is associated with the highest likelihood of resolution of nonseptic olecranon bursitis? (2) Which treatment is associated with earliest resolution of symptoms? (3) What factors are associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks?\n\nMethods: We enrolled 133 patients from two centers; after applying prespecified exclusions (septic bursitis or concomitant inflammatory arthritis, intraarticular elbow pathology, recent aspiration or steroid injection done elsewhere, and refusal to participate), 90 patients were randomly allocated to receive compression bandaging with NSAIDs (C), aspiration (A), or aspiration with steroid injection (AS) groups (30 patients in each). The groups were similar at baseline in terms of age and gender. Seven patients (four from Group A and three from Group AS) were lost to followup. All patients were followed up weekly for 4 weeks, and the same treatment procedure was repeated if the bursitis recurred with any substantial fluid collection. At 4 weeks, the state of resolution and pain visual analog scale (VAS) were evaluated. Failed resolution was defined as presence of persistent olecranon bursal fluid collection at Week 4 after the initiation of the treatment; on the contrary, if bursal fluid collection was clinically reduced or completely disappeared by the end of Week 4, the treatment was considered successful. We compared the proportion of resolution by Week 4 and the median times to resolution among the treatment groups. In addition, we evaluated whether the resolution affected pain VAS and what factors were associated with the resolution.\n\nResults: There were no differences in the proportion of patients whose bursitis resolved by Week 4 among the three treatment groups (Group C: 25 of 30 [83%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.27-1.72], p = 0.580; Group A: 17 of 26 [65%], relative risk of resolution failure: 2.19 [95% CI, 0.98-4.87], p = 0.083; Group AS: 23 of 27 [85%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.59 [95% CI, 0.22-1.63], p = 0.398) (p = 0.073). Steroid injection after aspiration (Group AS) was associated with the earliest resolution (2.3 weeks [range, 1-4 weeks]) when compared with aspiration alone (Group A; 3.1 weeks [range, 2-4 weeks]) and compression bandaging with NSAIDs (Group C; 3.2 weeks [range, 2-4 weeks]), p = 0.015). Longer duration of symptoms before treatment was the only factor associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks (failed resolution: 6 weeks [range, 2-9 weeks]; successful resolution: 4 weeks [range, 0.4-6 weeks]; p = 0.008).\n\nConclusions: With the numbers available, there were no differences in efficacy when compression bandaging with NSAIDs, aspiration, and aspiration with steroid injection were compared. However, we were powered only to detect a 30% difference, meaning that if there were a smaller difference in efficacy among the groups, we might not have detected it in a study of this size. Our data can be used as pilot data to power future prospective (and likely multicenter) trials. Because olecranon bursitis can recur, and because treatments like aspiration and aspiration with steroid injection can cause complications, unless future trials demonstrate clear efficacy advantages of aspiration and/or injection both at short and longer terms, we suggest that compression bandaging and a short course of NSAIDs may offer the most appropriate balance of safety and efficacy.",

        "abstract": "Background: Olecranon bursitis might be a minor problem in the outpatient clinic but relatively be common to occur. However, there are few well-designed studies comparing approaches to treatment.\n\nQuestions/purposes: (1) Which treatment (compression bandaging with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], aspiration, or aspiration with steroid injections) is associated with the highest likelihood of resolution of nonseptic olecranon bursitis? (2) Which treatment is associated with earliest resolution of symptoms? (3) What factors are associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks?\n\nMethods: We enrolled 133 patients from two centers; after applying prespecified exclusions (septic bursitis or concomitant inflammatory arthritis, intraarticular elbow pathology, recent aspiration or steroid injection done elsewhere, and refusal to participate), 90 patients were randomly allocated to receive compression bandaging with NSAIDs (C), aspiration (A), or aspiration with steroid injection (AS) groups (30 patients in each). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients whose bursitis resolved by Week 4. Secondary outcomes included time to resolution, pain visual analog scale (VAS), and factors associated with treatment failure. The groups were similar at baseline in terms of age and gender. Seven patients (four from Group A and three from Group AS) were lost to followup. All patients were followed up weekly for 4 weeks, and the same treatment procedure was repeated if the bursitis recurred with any substantial fluid collection. At 4 weeks, the state of resolution and pain visual analog scale (VAS) were evaluated. Failed resolution was defined as presence of persistent olecranon bursal fluid collection at Week 4 after the initiation of the treatment; on the contrary, if bursal fluid collection was clinically reduced or completely disappeared by the end of Week 4, the treatment was considered successful. We compared the proportion of resolution by Week 4 and the median times to resolution among the treatment groups. In addition, we evaluated whether the resolution affected pain VAS and what factors were associated with the resolution.\n\nResults: There were no differences in the proportion of patients whose bursitis resolved by Week 4 among the three treatment groups (Group C: 25 of 30 [83%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.27-1.72], p = 0.580; Group A: 17 of 26 [65%], relative risk of resolution failure: 2.19 [95% CI, 0.98-4.87], p = 0.083; Group AS: 23 of 27 [85%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.59 [95% CI, 0.22-1.63], p = 0.398) (p = 0.073). Time to resolution was 2.3 weeks (range, 1-4 weeks) for Group AS, 3.1 weeks (range, 2-4 weeks) for Group A, and 3.2 weeks (range, 2-4 weeks) for Group C (p = 0.015). Longer duration of symptoms before treatment was associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks (failed resolution: 6 weeks [range, 2-9 weeks]; successful resolution: 4 weeks [range, 0.4-6 weeks]; p = 0.008).\n\nConclusions: Compression bandaging with NSAIDs was not more effective than aspiration or aspiration with steroid injection in patients with nonseptic olecranon bursitis for the primary outcome of resolution by 4 weeks.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: The aim of the present study was to examine changes in radiological variables in a prospective randomized study comparing opening wedge (OW) and closing wedge (CW) techniques of high tibial osteotomy (HTO). Our hypothesis was that there would be no differences in joint line angles or correction accuracy between the two groups, that patellar height would increase after CW HTO and decrease after OW HTO, and that leg length and posterior tibial slope would decrease after CW HTO and increase after OW HTO.\n\nMethods: Radiological data were collected from 70 patients participating in an ongoing prospective randomized clinical trial comparing OW and CW HTOs. Digital standing hip-knee-ankle (HKA) radiographs as well as lateral radiographs in 30\u040e of flexion were obtained preoperatively and at 6 months for each patient. Joint line angles, HKA angle, leg length, Insall-Salvati index, Miura-Kawamura index and posterior tibial slope were measured using medical planning software. The complete preoperative radiological examinations of the first 50 patients were used in a study of intra- and inter-rater reliability of the measurements.\n\nResults: The mean posterior slope was reduced by 2.5\u040e in CW HTO, whereas it remained unchanged in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Mean leg length decreased 5.7 mm in CW HTO and increased 3.1 mm in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Changes in joint line angles, patellar height indexes and the correction accuracy showed no significant differences comparing the two techniques. Frontal plane reliability measurement intra- and inter-rater intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) varied from 0.81 to 0.99. Sagittal plane intra- and inter-rater ICC varied from 0.60 to 0.87. Posterior tibial slope intra- and inter-rater ICC showed the lowest values (0.70 and 0.60, respectively) corresponding to a smallest real difference of 4.5\u040e and 5.5\u040e, respectively.\n\nConclusions: Posterior tibial slope and leg length changes were significantly different in CW compared to OW HTOs. We recommend that possible alterations in tibial slope and leg length are considered when the technique of HTO is to be chosen. Landmark-based medical planning software shows good reliability and can be used in preoperative planning and postoperative evaluations of HTOs.",

We examine whether using a \nnoninvasive protocol would result in more rapid lactate clearance after 3 hours \nin patients with severe sepsis and septic shock in the emergency department.\nMETHODS: In this open-label randomized controlled trial, 122 adult patients with \nsepsis and serum lactate concentration of greater than or equal to 3.0 mmol/L \nwere randomized to receive usual care or intravenous fluid bolus administration \nguided by measurements of change of stroke volume index, using the noninvasive \ncardiac output monitor after passive\u0412\u00a0leg-raising maneuver. The primary outcome \nwas lactate clearance of more than 20% at 3 hours. Secondary outcomes included \nmortality, length of hospital and ICU stay, and total hospital cost. Analysis \nwas intention to treat.\nRESULTS: Similar proportions of patients in the randomized intervention group \n(70.5%; N=61) versus control group (73.8%; N=61) achieved the primary outcome, \nwith a relative risk of 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77 to 1.19). \nSecondary outcomes were similar in both groups (P>.05 for all comparisons). \nHospital mortality occurred in 6 patients (9.8%) each in the intervention and \ncontrol groups on or before 28 days (relative risk=1.00; 95% CI 0.34 to 2.93). \nAmong a subgroup of patients with underlying fluid overload states, those in the \nintervention group tended to receive clinically significantly more intravenous \nfluids at 3 hours (difference=975 mL; 95% CI -450 to 1,725 mL) and attained \nbetter lactate clearance (difference=19.7%; 95% CI -34.6% to 60.2%) compared \nwith the control group, with shorter hospital lengths of stay (difference=-4.5 \ndays; 95% CI -9.5 to 2.5 days).\nCONCLUSION: Protocol-based fluid resuscitation of patients with severe sepsis \nand septic shock with the noninvasive cardiac output monitor and passive \nleg-raising maneuver did not result in better outcomes compared with usual care. \nFuture studies to demonstrate the use of the noninvasive protocol-based care in \npatients with preexisting fluid overload states may be warranted.",

The primary and secondary outcome measures were insulin sensitivity assessed using a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test and hepatic triglyceride content with magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Exploratory outcomes were cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity and MRI and dual x-ray absorptiometry-derived measures of adiposity.\n\nResults: The study had 96% retention and attendance was 61\u00b121% and 55\u00b124% in the high- and moderate-intensity ET arms. Intention-to-treat analyses revealed that, at follow-up, insulin sensitivity was not different between high-intensity (-1.0 mU kg(-1) min(-1); 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.6, +1.4 mU kg(-1) min(-1)) and moderate-intensity (+0.26 mU kg(-1) min(-1); 95% CI: -1.3, +1.8 mU kg(-1) min(-1)) ET arms compared with controls (interaction, P=0.97). Similarly, hepatic triglyceride at follow-up was not different in high-intensity (-1.7% fat/water (F/W); 95% CI: -7.0, +3.6% F/W) and moderate-intensity (-0.40% FW; 95% CI: -6.0, +5.3% F/W) ET compared with controls. Both high intensity (+4.4 ml per kg-FFM (fat-free mass) per minute; 95% CI: 1.7, 7.1 ml kg-FFM(-1) min(-1)) and moderate intensity (+4.4 ml kg-FFM(-1) min(-1); 95% CI: 1.6, 7.3 ml kg-FFM(-1) min(-1)) increased cardiorespiratory fitness, relative to controls (interaction P<0.001).\n\nConclusions: ET improves cardiorespiratory fitness among obese adolescents; however, owing to lack of compliance, the influence of exercise intensity on insulin sensitivity and hepatic triglycerides remains unclear.",

        "abstract": "Background: The chronic effects of high-intensity endurance training on metabolic health outcomes in overweight adolescents remains poorly understood.\n\nObjective: To test the hypothesis that high-intensity endurance training (ET) is superior to moderate-intensity ET for improving risk factors for type 2 diabetes in overweight adolescents.\n\nDesign and methods: In this randomized trial, 106 overweight and obese adolescents (15.2 years; 76% female; 62% Caucasian) were randomly assigned to high-intensity ET (70-85% of heart rate reserve, n=38), moderate-intensity ET (40-55% heart rate reserve; n=32) or control for 6 months (n=36). The primary outcome measure was insulin sensitivity assessed using a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. The secondary outcome measure was hepatic triglyceride content with magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Exploratory outcomes were cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity and MRI and dual x-ray absorptiometry-derived measures of adiposity.\n\nResults: The study had 96% retention and attendance was 61\u00b121% and 55\u00b124% in the high- and moderate-intensity ET arms. Intention-to-treat analyses revealed that, at follow-up, insulin sensitivity was not different between high-intensity (-1.0 mU kg(-1) min(-1); 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.6, +1.4 mU kg(-1) min(-1)) and moderate-intensity (+0.26 mU kg(-1) min(-1); 95% CI: -1.3, +1.8 mU kg(-1) min(-1)) ET arms compared with controls (interaction, P=0.97). Similarly, hepatic triglyceride at follow-up was not different in high-intensity (-1.7% fat/water (F/W); 95% CI: -7.0, +3.6% F/W) and moderate-intensity (-0.40% FW; 95% CI: -6.0, +5.3% F/W) ET compared with controls. Both high intensity (+4.4 ml per kg-FFM (fat-free mass) per minute; 95% CI: 1.7, 7.1 ml kg-FFM(-1) min(-1)) and moderate intensity (+4.4 ml kg-FFM(-1) min(-1); 95% CI: 1.6, 7.3 ml kg-FFM(-1) min(-1)) increased cardiorespiratory fitness, relative to controls (interaction P<0.001).\n\nConclusions: High-intensity ET was not more effective on insulin sensitivity than moderate-intensity ET in overweight adolescents.",

However, \nduring the needling process, a cuff defect is created. Little is known about the \nevolution of this defect.\nMETHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial to \ninvestigate the evolution of the aforementioned defect and the role of \nplatelet-rich plasma (PRP) augmentation in this healing process. Patients were \nrandomized to either group 1 (PRP, n\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u203020) or group 2 (no PRP [control group], \nn\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u203020). Patients in group 1 received a perioperative PRP infiltration at the \nrotator cuff defect, whereas the control group did not. Patients were assessed \nclinically preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and 1 \nyear. The Constant score, Simple Shoulder Test, and QuickDASH (short version of \nDisabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire) were used as outcome \nmeasures. The evolution of the cuff defect was evaluated on sonography at 3 and \n6 months and with magnetic resonance imaging after 1 year.\nRESULTS: All patients improved significantly after surgery (P\u0432\u0402\u2030<\u0432\u0402\u2030.05). There was \nno difference in clinical outcome or rotator cuff healing between groups. We \nobserved a high rate of persistent rotator cuff defects after 1 year in both \ngroups. The presence of residual cuff defects did not influence the clinical \noutcome.\nCONCLUSION: Arthroscopic needling is an operation with a predictive, good \nclinical outcome. We found a high rate of persistent rotator cuff defects after \n1 year. This study could not identify any beneficial effect of the addition of \nPRP on rotator cuff healing.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recently, an accelerated rehabilitation protocol after rotator cuff \n(RC) repair has been proposed for patients at risk of postoperative stiffness.\nPURPOSE: To investigate, in patients undergoing early accelerated mobilization, \nwhether double-row (DR) repair provides better clinical outcomes and a lower \nretear rate compared with single-row (SR) configurations.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\nMETHODS: A total of 58 patients were randomized to undergo either SR or DR \nrepair. After 2 years of follow-up, 12 men and 13 women (mean age, 61.8 years; \nrange, 52-67 years) in the SR group and 15 men and 10 women (mean age, 58.9 \nyears; range, 51-69 years) in the DR group were evaluated. To assess the retear \nrate, magnetic resonance imaging of the shoulder was performed at 2-year \nfollow-up. The clinical evaluation was based on the modified University of \nCalifornia, Los Angeles (UCLA) shoulder score and range of motion (ROM) \nmeasurements.\nRESULTS: Magnetic resonance arthrography showed a significantly lower \nfull-thickness retear rate for the DR group than for the SR group (8% vs 24%, \nrespectively; P < .05). At both 6-month and 2-year follow-up, there \nwas no statistically significant difference in terms of the rate of stiffness in \nthe SR and DR groups (8% vs 12% and 0% vs 0%, respectively; P > .05). No \nclinical differences were recorded regarding the UCLA score (SR group: mean, \n32.6 [range, 30-35]; DR group: mean, 33.3 [range, 29-35]; P = .61) and ROM.\nCONCLUSION: DR repair was not more effective than SR repair on clinical outcomes in patients undergoing early accelerated mobilization after rotator cuff repair.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recently, an accelerated rehabilitation protocol after rotator cuff \n(RC) repair has been proposed for patients at risk of postoperative stiffness.\nPURPOSE: To investigate, in patients undergoing early accelerated mobilization, \nwhether double-row (DR) repair provides better clinical outcomes and a lower \nretear rate compared with single-row (SR) configurations.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\nMETHODS: A total of 58 patients were randomized to undergo either SR or DR \nrepair. After 2 years of follow-up, 12 men and 13 women (mean age, 61.8 years; \nrange, 52-67 years) in the SR group and 15 men and 10 women (mean age, 58.9 \nyears; range, 51-69 years) in the DR group were evaluated. To assess the retear \nrate, magnetic resonance imaging of the shoulder was performed at 2-year \nfollow-up. The clinical evaluation was based on the modified University of \nCalifornia, Los Angeles (UCLA) shoulder score and range of motion (ROM) \nmeasurements.\nRESULTS: Magnetic resonance arthrography showed a significantly lower \nfull-thickness retear rate for the DR group than for the SR group (8% vs 24%, \nrespectively; P < .05). Conversely, at both 6-month and 2-year follow-up, there \nwas no statistically significant difference in terms of the rate of stiffness in \nthe SR and DR groups (8% vs 12% and 0% vs 0%, respectively; P > .05). No \nclinical differences were recorded regarding the UCLA score (SR group: mean, \n32.6 [range, 30-35]; DR group: mean, 33.3 [range, 29-35]; P = .61) and ROM.\nCONCLUSION: In selected patients at a high risk of shoulder stiffness and \ntherefore necessitating accelerated postoperative rehabilitation, DR repair of \nthe RC could lower retear rates.",

This prospective \nrandomized study comparing navigation-assisted TKA and conventional TKA reported \nthe clinical and radiological outcomes at a follow-up of 9\u0412\u00a0years. The purpose of \nthis study was to compare the clinical and radiological outcomes for patients \nwho underwent navigation-assisted TKA or conventional TKA after long-term \nfollow-up.\nMETHODS: A total of 80 patients (88 knees) were available for physical and \nradiological examination 9\u0412\u00a0years after TKA. Clinical outcomes were evaluated \nusing HSS, WOMAC, and KS function and pain scores. And radiological outcomes of \nthe component loosening and its survivorship during 9-year follow-up were also \nevaluated.\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences in the field of clinical outcomes \nbetween the two groups. In terms of radiological outcomes, the navigation group \nhad fewer alignment outliers (7.3 vs 20\u0412\u00a0%, p\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a00.006). Although the clinical \noutcomes showed no differences between the two groups, the survival rate was \nslightly better in the navigation group than in the conventional group without \nstatistical significance (best-case scenario 100 vs 95.3\u0412\u00a0%, n.s., worst-case \nscenario 95.6 vs 88.4\u0412\u00a0%, n.s.).\nCONCLUSION: Navigation-assisted TKA produced better alignment outcomes and \nbetter survival rates than conventional instruments although some of the \ndifferences were not statistically significant.",

The purpose of \nthis study was to compare the clinical and radiological outcomes for patients \nwho underwent navigation-assisted TKA or conventional TKA after long-term \nfollow-up.\nMETHODS: A total of 80 patients (88 knees) were available for physical and \nradiological examination 9 years after TKA. Clinical outcomes were evaluated \nusing HSS, WOMAC, and KS function and pain scores. Radiological outcomes of \nthe component loosening and its survivorship during 9-year follow-up were also \nevaluated.\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences in clinical outcomes \nbetween the two groups. In terms of radiological outcomes, the navigation group \nhad fewer alignment outliers (7.3 vs 20%, p = 0.006). The survival rate \nshowed no statistically significant difference between groups (best-case scenario 100 vs 95.3%, n.s., worst-case \nscenario 95.6 vs 88.4%, n.s.).\nCONCLUSION: Navigation-assisted TKA was not more effective than conventional TKA in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.",

We examined whether a novel suspended release local anesthetic, liposomal bupivacaine (LB) would improve pain control and decrease opioid consumption after TKA compared to a standard periarticular injection in opioid-dependent patients.\n\nMethods: Thirty-eight patients undergoing TKA were randomly assigned to receive either a periarticular injection (PAI) with LB (n = 20) or with a standard PAI (including a combination of ropivacaine, clonidine, Toradol, Epinepherine, and saline; n = 18) as part of a multimodal pain management approach.

However, when examining pain levels separately for each day, pain visual analog scale scores were reported higher in post operative day 1 in the LB group (P = .033).\n\nConclusions: LB was not found to be superior to standard PAI in opioid-dependent patients undergoing TKA.

Secondary outcomes included fasting glucose, triglyceride/HDL ratio, waist circumference, blood pressure, and C-reactive protein.\n\nResults: For the primary outcome of weight change, the mindfulness arm compared to control showed -1.9 kg (95% CI: -4.5, 0.8; P = 0.17) at 12 months and -1.7 kg (95% CI: -4.7, 1.2; P = 0.24) at 18 months. For secondary outcomes, changes in fasting glucose were -3.1 mg/dl (95% CI: -6.3, 0.1; P = 0.06) at 12 months and -4.1 mg/dl (95% CI: -7.3, -0.9; P = 0.01) at 18 months. Changes in triglyceride/HDL ratio were -0.57 (95% CI: -0.95, -0.18; P = 0.004) at 12 months and -0.36 (95% CI: -0.74, 0.03; P = 0.07) at 18 months.

The aim of this study was to determine whether there are middle-term differences in knee function and pain in patients undergoing fixed- and mobile-bearing total knee arthroplasty (TKA).\n\nMethods: Eligible patients were randomized into two groups: the first group received TKA implantation with a fixed tibial platform (group A); the second group received TKA with a mobile tibial platform (group B). Patients were followed up (2 years), and their symptoms and limitations in daily living activities were evaluated using the Knee Outcome Survey-Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADLS), in addition to pain evaluation assessed using the pain visual analogue scale (VAS).\n\nResults: There were no significant differences in function and symptoms in the ADLS and VAS between the study groups.\n\nConclusion: The type of platform used in TKA (fixed vs. mobile) does not change the symptoms, function or pain of patients 2 years post-surgery. Although mobile TKAs may have better short-term results, at medium- and long-term follow-up they do not present important clinical differences compared with fixed-platform TKAs. This information is important so that surgeons can choose the most suitable implant for each patient.",

Patients were followed up (2 years), and their symptoms and limitations in daily living activities were evaluated using the Knee Outcome Survey-Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADLS), in addition to pain evaluation assessed using the pain visual analogue scale (VAS).\n\nResults: There were no significant differences in function and symptoms in the ADLS and VAS between the study groups.\n\nConclusion: Mobile-bearing TKA was not more effective than fixed-bearing TKA in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.",

Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 1.5, \n3, 6, and 12 months after ACI and was evaluated by the magnetic resonance \nobservation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score and the Knee injury and \nOsteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS).\nRESULTS: MOCART scores showed improvements after 3 months, with slight dose \ndependence, and further improvement after 12 months, although without \nsignificant dose dependence. The mean MOCART scores after 3 months (0 = worst, \n100 = best) were 59.8, 64.5, and 64.7 for the low-, medium-, and high-dose \ngroups, respectively, and 62.9 for all patients; at 12 months, these were 74.1, \n74.5, and 68.8 for the respective dose groups and 72.4 for all patients. Several \nMOCART items (surface of repair tissue, structure of repair tissue, signal \nintensity of repair tissue, subchondral bone, and synovitis) showed a more rapid \nresponse with the medium and high doses than with the low dose, suggesting a \npotential dose relationship. No significant correlation between the MOCART \n(overall and subscores) with clinical outcomes as assessed by the overall KOOS \nwas detected at 3- and 12-month assessments.\nCONCLUSION: This study reveals a trend toward earlier recovery after treatment \nwith higher spheroid doses in terms of better defect filling for full-thickness \ncartilage defects of the knee, while outcomes after 12 months were similar in \nall dose groups. However, a correlation with clinical outcomes or the failure \nrate at 1 year after ACI was not found. A longer follow-up will be required for \nmore definite conclusions on the clinical relevance of ACI cell density to be \ndrawn.\nREGISTRATION: NCT01225575 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier); 2009-016816-20 \n(EudraCT number).",

Secondary \noutcomes included MOCART scores at 1.5, 3, and 6 months and the Knee injury and \nOsteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) at all time points.\nRESULTS: The mean MOCART scores at 12 months (0 = worst, 100 = best) were 74.1, \n74.5, and 68.8 for the low-, medium-, and high-dose groups, respectively, and \n72.4 for all patients, with no significant difference between dose groups. The \nmean MOCART scores at 3 months were 59.8, 64.5, and 64.7 for the low-, medium-, \nand high-dose groups, respectively, and 62.9 for all patients. Several MOCART \nitems (surface of repair tissue, structure of repair tissue, signal intensity of \nrepair tissue, subchondral bone, and synovitis) showed differences between dose \ngroups at earlier time points. No significant correlation between the MOCART \n(overall and subscores) with clinical outcomes as assessed by the overall KOOS \nwas detected at 3- and 12-month assessments.\nCONCLUSION: Higher spheroid doses were not more effective than lower spheroid \ndoses on MOCART scores at 12 months in patients with full-thickness cartilage \ndefects of the knee.\nREGISTRATION: NCT01225575 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier); 2009-016816-20 \n(EudraCT number).",

This study compared the outcomes of tenotomy with outcomes of tenodesis for treatment of LHBT lesions with rotator cuff tears.\n\nMethods: The study enrolled 128 patients with LHBT lesions and small- to medium-sized rotator cuff tear. Arthroscopic LHBT tenotomy was done in 56 patients (group I), and LHBT tenodesis was done for 72 patients (group II) with rotator cuff repair. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Score, simple shoulder test, pain visual analog scale, range of motion, and cosmetic changes were assessed initially, at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively, and the last visit. The elbow motor power and magnetic resonance imaging were evaluated at 12 months.\n\nResults: Both groups showed improvement in functional scores after treatments, but no significant difference was found between the 2 groups at each assessment. The rate of Popeye deformity was 3 times higher in group I (P = .04). Group II showed greater forearm supination power than group I (P = .02). On magnetic resonance imaging, 45 patients (80.4%) in group I showed maintenance of the LHBT cut end within the bicipital groove, whereas 65 patients (90.3%) in group II showed maintenance of fixated LHBT.\n\nConclusion: For the treatment of LHBT lesions with rotator cuff tear, patients with tenotomy and tenodesis both showed significant improvements in functional scores.

Angle-specific peak torque results of \naffected legs showed that surgery resulted in faster and better recovery of calf \nmuscle strength over the entire range of motion of the ankle joint: at 6 months, \nthe difference varied from 16% to 24% (P = .016), favoring the surgically \ntreated group, whereas at 18 months, surgically treated patients had 10% to 18% \ngreater strength results (P = .037). At 18 months, a 14% difference in the peak \ntorque of the affected leg favored the surgical group versus the nonsurgical \ngroup (mean peak torque, 110.3 vs 96.5 N\u0412\u00b7m, respectively; mean difference, 13.6 \nN\u0412\u00b7m; 95% CI, 2.0-25.1 N\u0412\u00b7m; P = .022). The RAND 36-Item Health Survey indicated \nbetter results in the domains of physical functioning (P = .006) and bodily pain \n(P = .037) for surgically treated patients.\nCONCLUSION: Surgical and nonsurgical treatments of acute Achilles tendon \nruptures have similar results in terms of the Achilles tendon performance score, \nbut surgery restores calf muscle strength earlier over the entire range of \nmotion of the ankle joint, with a 10% to 18% strength difference favoring \nsurgery at 18 months. Surgery may also result in better health-related quality \nof life in the domains of physical functioning and bodily pain compared with \nnonsurgical treatment.\nREGISTRATION: NCT02012803 (ClinicalTrials.gov).",

        "abstract": "Background: Opioid analgesics have been a standard modality for postoperative pain management after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) but are also associated with increased risk of nausea, pruritus, vomiting, respiratory depression, prolonged ileus, and cognitive dysfunction. There is still a need for a method of anesthesia that can deliver effective long-term postoperative pain relief without incurring the high cost and health burden of opioids and nerve blocks.\n\nQuestions/purposes: (1) Is liposomal bupivacaine-based periarticular injection (PAI) more effective than morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA? (2) Do patients treated with liposomal bupivacaine-based PAI experience fewer opioid-related adverse events compared with patients treated with morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA?\n\nMethods: This multicenter, blind trial randomized 119 patients undergoing TKA with spinal anesthesia to receive spinal anesthesia plus periarticular injection with liposomal bupivacaine (40 patients), spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine plus intrathecal morphine (41 patients) but no liposomal bupivacaine injection, or spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine (38 patients) and no liposomal bupivacaine injection. The two groups that did not receive periarticular liposomal bupivacaine did receive periarticular injection with ropivacaine, and all three groups had ketorolac (30 mg) plus epinephrine (1:1000) in the periarticular injections. Patients in all three groups received identical perioperative multimodal analgesic and antiemetic drugs. All patients were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized and no patients were lost to followup. The primary study endpoints were visual analog score (VAS) for pain and narcotic use during postoperative day 1. Secondary endpoints included side effects associated with narcotic administration during the hospital stay.\n\nResults: Mean VAS pain in the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group was lower than that for the ropivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (1.8 \u00b1 2.1 versus 3.3 \u00b1 2.3, p = 0.005, mean difference: 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-2.5) and 12 hours (1.5 \u00b1 2.0 versus 3.3 \u00b1 2.4, p < 0.001, mean difference: 1.8, 95% CI, 0.8-2.8) after surgery. The morphine spinal group had lower pain compared with the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (0.9 \u00b1 1.8 versus 1.8 \u00b1 2.1, p = 0.035, mean difference: 1.0, 95% CI, 0.1-1.8), but there was no difference at 12 hours (0.8 \u00b1 1.5 versus 1.5 \u00b1 2.0, p = 0.086, mean difference: 0.7, 95% CI, -0.1 to 1.5). The magnitude of the differences at 6 and 12 hours are near the lower end of minimal clinically important differences reported in the literature, and thus the improvement shown in this study may only represent a small clinical improvement. Both the liposomal bupivacaine group (13% [five of 40]) and the ropivacaine group (5% [two of 38]) had fewer incidents of itching (pruritus) than the spinal morphine group (38% [15 of 41]) (p = 0.001).\n\nConclusions: Liposomal bupivacaine-based periarticular injection was not more effective than morphine-based spinal anesthesia on visual analog score for pain and narcotic use during postoperative day 1 in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.",

        "abstract": "Background: Opioid analgesics have been a standard modality for postoperative pain management after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) but are also associated with increased risk of nausea, pruritus, vomiting, respiratory depression, prolonged ileus, and cognitive dysfunction. There is still a need for a method of anesthesia that can deliver effective long-term postoperative pain relief without incurring the high cost and health burden of opioids and nerve blocks.\n\nQuestions/purposes: (1) Is liposomal bupivacaine-based periarticular injection (PAI) more effective than morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA? (2) Do patients treated with liposomal bupivacaine-based PAI experience fewer opioid-related adverse events compared with patients treated with morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA?\n\nMethods: This multicenter, blind trial randomized 119 patients undergoing TKA with spinal anesthesia to receive spinal anesthesia plus periarticular injection with liposomal bupivacaine (40 patients), spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine plus intrathecal morphine (41 patients) but no liposomal bupivacaine injection, or spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine (38 patients) and no liposomal bupivacaine injection. The two groups that did not receive periarticular liposomal bupivacaine did receive periarticular injection with ropivacaine, and all three groups had ketorolac (30 mg) plus epinephrine (1:1000) in the periarticular injections. Patients in all three groups received identical perioperative multimodal analgesic and antiemetic drugs. All patients were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized and no patients were lost to followup. The primary study endpoints were visual analog score (VAS) for pain and narcotic use during postoperative day 1. Secondary endpoints included side effects associated with narcotic administration during the hospital stay.\n\nResults: Mean VAS pain in the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group was lower than that for the ropivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (1.8 \u00b1 2.1 versus 3.3 \u00b1 2.3, p = 0.005, mean difference: 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-2.5) and 12 hours (1.5 \u00b1 2.0 versus 3.3 \u00b1 2.4, p < 0.001, mean difference: 1.8, 95% CI, 0.8-2.8) after surgery. The morphine spinal group had lower pain compared with the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (0.9 \u00b1 1.8 versus 1.8 \u00b1 2.1, p = 0.035, mean difference: 1.0, 95% CI, 0.1-1.8), but there was no difference at 12 hours (0.8 \u00b1 1.5 versus 1.5 \u00b1 2.0, p = 0.086, mean difference: 0.7, 95% CI, -0.1 to 1.5). The magnitude of the differences at 6 and 12 hours are near the lower end of minimal clinically important differences reported in the literature, and thus the improvement shown in this study may only represent a small clinical improvement. Both the liposomal bupivacaine group (13% [five of 40]) and the ropivacaine group (5% [two of 38]) had fewer incidents of itching (pruritus) than the spinal morphine group (38% [15 of 41]) (p = 0.001).\n\nConclusions: This prospective multicenter three-arm blind randomized controlled trial showed potentially improved pain control at 6 and 12 hours in the liposomal bupivacaine and intrathecal morphine groups compared with the ropivacaine group at the cost of much higher incidences of pruritus (itching) in the intrathecal morphine group. Based on these results, we prefer the use of PAI with liposomal bupivacaine as an alternative to spinal anesthesia with intrathecal morphine as a result of similar postoperative pain control and the potential for reducing adverse events.",

All the \nsurgical procedures were performed by the same senior surgeon using the DB \nreconstruction technique. All irradiated hamstring tendon allografts were \nsterilized with 2.5 Mrad of irradiation before distribution and were obtained \nfrom a single certified tissue bank.

The primary outcome was the \nrisk for anterior protrusion of the cup above the acetabular rim and thus \npotential psoas impingement, defined as an overhang of the cup above the \nanterior acetabular rim as measured on postoperative CT, which was either \ncontrolled with the help of navigation or standard control by eye and palpation \nintraoperatively. Postoperatively, the anterior protrusion of the cup above the \nacetabular rim was measured on three-dimensional (3-D) CT by a blinded, external \ninstitute. In addition to patient-related outcome measures, the Harris hip \nscore, Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and EuroQol were \nobtained 1 year postoperatively. Altogether 123 data sets were available for \nprimary analysis and 115 were available for 1-year followup.\nRESULTS: There was no difference, with the numbers available, between the \nnavigated and the control groups in terms of the mean distance of the cup below \nthe anterosuperior acetabular rim (3.9 mm; -5.3 to 12.6 mm versus 4.4 mm; -7.9 \nto 13.7 mm; p = 0.72) or the anteroinferior acetabular rim (4.7 mm; -6.2 to 14.8 \nmm versus 4.2 mm; -7.1 to 16.3 mm; p = 0.29).

Participants were randomly divided into three groups: EXER, exercise program; EXER + CBT, exercise program plus support group sessions for lifestyle modification, with a CBT; and CONTROL, routine treatment. The primary outcome was weight change. They were compared on weight, functional capacity, and cardiometabolic profile.\n\nResults: The weight change (Kg) was -7.4 (-9.6 to 5,1); -4,2 (-6,8 to -1.6) and 2.9 (0.4 to 5.3) and the BMI change (kg/m2) was -2.7 (-3.6 to -1.8); -1.4 (-2.4 to -0.4) and 1.1 (0.1 to 2.1) for groups EXER, EXER + CBT, and CONTROL, respectively. Changes were significant when compared to the control group (p < 0.001), but there were no differences between the two intervention arms (p = 0.2). Functional capacity and cardiometabolic parameters improved in the intervention arms and worsened in the control group.

Participants were randomly divided into three groups: EXER, exercise program; EXER + CBT, exercise program plus support group sessions for lifestyle modification, with a CBT; and CONTROL, routine treatment. They were compared on weight, functional capacity, and cardiometabolic profile.\n\nResults: The weight change (Kg) was -7.4 (-9.6 to 5,1); -4,2 (-6,8 to -1.6) and 2.9 (0.4 to 5.3) and the BMI change (kg/m2) was -2.7 (-3.6 to -1.8); -1.4 (-2.4 to -0.4) and 1.1 (0.1 to 2.1) for groups EXER, EXER + CBT, and CONTROL, respectively. Changes were significant when compared to the control group (p < 0.001), but there were no differences between the two intervention arms (p = 0.2). Functional capacity and cardiometabolic parameters significantly improved in the intervention arms and worsened in the control group. The adherence to the exercise program in both groups was above 78 %.\n\nConclusion: A 4-month, twice-weekly supervised program of low-intensity physical activity that encourages individuals to adopt a more active lifestyle can positively interfere with weight loss and improvement in functional capacity and cardiometabolic parameters of morbidly obese individuals with and without the aid of support group sessions.",

One group received preemptive intra-articular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection, and the second group received preemptive periacetabular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection. Before closure all patients received an additional dose of 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% intra-articularly. Data were compared with respect to postoperative pain with visual analog scale (VAS) and analgesic consumption, documented in a pain diary for 2 weeks after surgery.\n\nResults: Twenty-one patients were treated with intra-articular injection, and 21 patients with peri-acetabular injection. There were no significant differences with regards to patient demographics or surgical procedures. VAS scores recorded during the first 30 minutes postoperatively and 18 hours after surgery were significantly lower in the periacetabular group compared with in the intra-articular group (0.667 \u00b1 1.49 vs 2.11 \u00b1 2.29; P < .045 and 2.62 \u00b1 2.2 vs 4.79 \u00b1 2.6; P < .009). There were no differences between the groups with regard to analgesic consumption.\n\nConclusions: Periacetabular injection of bupivacaine 0.5% was superior to intra-articular injection in pain reduction after hip arthroscopy at 30 minutes and 18 hours postoperatively. However, total analgesic consumption over the first 2 postoperative weeks and VAS pain measurements were not significantly affected.",

One group received preemptive intra-articular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection, and the second group received preemptive periacetabular 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% injection. Before closure all patients received an additional dose of 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% intra-articularly. Data were compared with respect to postoperative pain with visual analog scale (VAS) and analgesic consumption, documented in a pain diary for 2 weeks after surgery.\n\nResults: Twenty-one patients were treated with intra-articular injection, and 21 patients with peri-acetabular injection. There were no significant differences with regards to patient demographics or surgical procedures. VAS scores recorded during the first 30 minutes postoperatively were 0.667 \u00b1 1.49 in the periacetabular group versus 2.11 \u00b1 2.29 in the intra-articular group (P < .045). VAS scores at 18 hours after surgery were 2.62 \u00b1 2.2 in the periacetabular group versus 4.79 \u00b1 2.6 in the intra-articular group (P < .009). There were no differences between the groups with regard to analgesic consumption.\n\nConclusions: The periacetabular injection was not more effective than intra-articular injection for postoperative pain control in patients undergoing hip arthroscopy.",

Diazepam and meclizine are oral medications that \nare commonly used to alleviate symptoms.\nOBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether meclizine or diazepam is superior in \nthe treatment of patients with peripheral vertigo in the ED.\nMETHODS: We performed a double-blind clinical trial at a suburban, teaching ED. \nWe randomized a convenience sample of adult patients with acute peripheral \nvertigo (APV) to diazepam 5 mg or meclizine 25 mg orally. Demographic and \nhistorical features were recorded on a standardized data form. Patients recorded \ntheir initial level (t0) of vertigo on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) and \nafter 30 min (t30) and 60 min (t60). The primary outcome parameter was the mean \nchange in VAS score from t0 to t60. Differences between groups and 95% \nconfidence intervals were calculated. Our a priori power calculation estimated \nthat a sample size of 20 patients in each group was required to have an 80% \npower to detect a difference of 20 mm between treatment groups.\nRESULTS: There were 20 patients in the diazepam group and 20 in the meclizine \ngroup. The two groups were similar with respect to patient demographics and \npresenting signs and symptoms. At t60, the mean change in VAS score in the diazepam group was 36 and in the meclizine group was 40 (difference -4; 95% confidence \ninterval -20 to 12; p = 0.60).\nCONCLUSION: Diazepam was not more effective than meclizine for the treatment of ED patients with acute peripheral vertigo.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vertigo is a debilitating disease that is commonly encountered in \nthe emergency department (ED). Diazepam and meclizine are oral medications that \nare commonly used to alleviate symptoms.\nOBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether meclizine or diazepam is superior in \nthe treatment of patients with peripheral vertigo in the ED.\nMETHODS: We performed a double-blind clinical trial at a suburban, teaching ED. \nWe randomized a convenience sample of adult patients with acute peripheral \nvertigo (APV) to diazepam 5\u0412\u00a0mg or meclizine 25\u0412\u00a0mg orally. Demographic and \nhistorical features were recorded on a standardized data form. Patients recorded \ntheir initial level (t0) of vertigo on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) and \nafter 30\u0412\u00a0min (t30) and 60\u0412\u00a0min (t60). The primary outcome parameter was the mean \nchange in VAS score from t0 to t60. Differences between groups and 95% \nconfidence intervals were calculated. Our a priori power calculation estimated \nthat a sample size of 20 patients in each group was required to have an 80% \npower to detect a difference of 20\u0412\u00a0mm between treatment groups.\nRESULTS: There were 20 patients in the diazepam group and 20 in the meclizine \ngroup. The two groups were similar with respect to patient demographics and \npresenting signs and symptoms. At t60, the mean improvements in the diazepam and \nmeclizine groups were 36 and 40, respectively (difference -4; 95% confidence \ninterval -20 to 12; p\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a00.60).\nCONCLUSION: We found no difference between oral diazepam and oral meclizine for \nthe treatment of ED patients with acute peripheral vertigo.",

Exclusions were patients with multiple injuries, other conditions limiting mobility, and ankle injuries that required immobilisation and those unable to accommodate the time intensive study protocol.\n\nIntervention: Participants received either usual care, consisting of written instructions regarding protection, rest, cryotherapy, compression, elevation, and graduated weight bearing activities, or usual care enhanced with a supervised programme of physiotherapy.\n\nMain outcome measures: The primary outcome of efficacy was the proportion of participants reporting excellent recovery assessed with the foot and ankle outcome score (FAOS). Excellent recovery was defined as a score \u0456450/500 at three months. A difference of at least 15% increase in the absolute proportion of participants with excellent recovery was deemed clinically important. Secondary analyses included the assessment of excellent recovery at one and six months; change from baseline using continuous scores at one, three, and six months; and clinical and biomechanical measures of ankle function, assessed at one, three, and six months.\n\nResults: The absolute proportion of patients achieving excellent recovery at three months was not significantly different between the physiotherapy (98/229, 43%) and usual care (79/214, 37%) arms (absolute difference 6%, 95% confidence interval -3% to 15%). The observed trend towards benefit with physiotherapy did not increase in the per protocol analysis and was in the opposite direction by six months. These trends remained similar and were never statistically or clinically important when the FAOS was analysed as a continuous change score.\n\nConclusions: In a general population of patients seeking hospital based acute care for simple ankle sprains, there is no evidence to support a clinically important improvement in outcome with the addition of supervised physiotherapy to usual care, as provided in this protocol.",

Included patients met the migraine criteria of the International Headache Society. Patients were randomized to intranasal lidocaine or saline solution; all participants received 10 mg of intravenous metoclopramide. Patient pain intensity was assessed with an 11-point numeric rating scale score. The primary outcome measure was the change in pain scores at 15 minutes; secondary outcomes were changes in pain intensity after pain onset and need for rescue medication.\n\nResults: Patients (n=162) were randomized into 2 groups with similar baseline migraine characteristics and numeric rating scale scores. The median reduction in numeric rating scale score at 15 minutes was 3 (interquartile range [IQR] 2 to 5) for the lidocaine group and 2 (IQR 1 to 4) for the saline solution group (median difference=1.0; 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 2.1). The reduction in pain score at 30 minutes was 4 (IQR 3 to 7) for the lidocaine group and 5 (IQR 2 to 7) for the saline solution group (median difference=1.0; 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 2.1). Need for rescue medication did not differ between the groups, and local irritation was the most common adverse event in the lidocaine group.\n\nConclusion: Although intranasal lidocaine was found no more efficacious than normal saline solution in our study, future studies should focus on patients who present earlier after headache onset.",

        "abstract": "Study objective: The study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intranasal lidocaine administration for migraine treatment.\n\nMethods: This single-center, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial was conducted in a tertiary care emergency department. Included patients met the migraine criteria of the International Headache Society. Patients were randomized to intranasal lidocaine or saline solution; all participants received 10 mg of intravenous metoclopramide. Patient pain intensity was assessed with an 11-point numeric rating scale score. The primary outcome measure was the change in pain scores at 15 minutes; secondary outcomes were changes in pain intensity at 30 minutes and need for rescue medication.\n\nResults: Patients (n=162) were randomized into 2 groups with similar baseline migraine characteristics and numeric rating scale scores. The median reduction in numeric rating scale score at 15 minutes was 3 (interquartile range [IQR] 2 to 5) for the lidocaine group and 2 (IQR 1 to 4) for the saline solution group (median difference=1.0; 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 2.1). The reduction in pain score at 30 minutes was 4 (IQR 3 to 7) for the lidocaine group and 5 (IQR 2 to 7) for the saline solution group (median difference=1.0; 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 2.1). Need for rescue medication did not differ between the groups, and local irritation was the most common adverse event in the lidocaine group.\n\nConclusion: Intranasal lidocaine was not more effective than saline solution in patients with migraine.",

        "abstract": "AIMS: To investigate the metabolic effects of 12-week oral supplementation with \nLactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 in patients with type 2 diabetes on insulin \ntherapy.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: In a double-blind trial, we randomized 46 people with \ntype 2 diabetes to placebo or a low (108 \u0432\u0402\u2030CFU/d) or high dose (1010 \u0432\u0402\u2030CFU/d) of \nL. reuteri DSM 17938 for 12\u0432\u0402\u2030weeks. The primary endpoint was the effect of \nsupplementation on glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). Secondary endpoints were \ninsulin sensitivity (assessed by glucose clamp), liver fat content, body \ncomposition, body fat distribution, faecal microbiota composition and serum bile \nacids.\nRESULTS: Supplementation with L. reuteri DSM 17938 for 12\u0432\u0402\u2030weeks did not affect \nHbA1c, liver steatosis, adiposity or microbiota composition. Participants who \nreceived the highest dose of L. reuteri exhibited increases in insulin \nsensitivity index (ISI) and serum levels of the secondary bile acid deoxycholic \nacid (DCA) compared with baseline, but these differences were not significant in \nthe between-group analyses. Post hoc analysis showed that participants who \nresponded with increased ISI after L. reuteri supplementation had higher \nmicrobial diversity at baseline, and increased serum levels of DCA after \nsupplementation. In addition, increases in DCA levels correlated with \nimprovement in insulin sensitivity in the probiotic recipients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Intake of L. reuteri DSM 17938 for 12\u0432\u0402\u2030weeks did not affect HbA1c in \npeople with type 2 diabetes on insulin therapy; however, L. reuteri improved \ninsulin sensitivity in a subset of participants and we propose that high \ndiversity of the gut microbiota at baseline may be important.",

One hundred one patients were randomized to receive either TXA or an equivalent volume of normal saline. The primary outcome measure was thigh swelling. Secondary outcome measures included, visual analogue pain score, timed up and go test, a 10 meter walk test, and length of stay. Blood loss and the incidence of blood transfusions were also recorded.\n\nResults: There were no statistically significant differences between the primary outcome of thigh swelling or the secondary outcome measures of postoperative pain nor mobility. There was a significant reduction in length of stay for those that received TXA 3.58 days (0.84) compared with the control group 4.27 days (0.98) (P < .001). There was significantly less intraoperative blood loss observed in the TXA group (0.460L SD 0.228) compared with the control group (0.687L SD 0.283L) (P < .001). The estimated blood loss was also significantly less in the TXA group (1.084L SD 0.440) compared with the control group (1.394 L SD 0.426).\n\nConclusion: TXA is an effective agent in reducing blood loss in total hip arthroplasty using the anterior approach. The blood conserving effect of TXA was not associated with improved postoperative recovery across the measures of pain and mobility.",

        "abstract": "Background: We examined whether the blood conserving effect of tranexamic acid (TXA) in total hip arthroplasty using the direct anterior approach, translates to an effect on functional outcomes in the perioperative period.\n\nMethods: We conducted a single-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. One hundred one patients were randomized to receive either TXA or an equivalent volume of normal saline. The primary outcome measure was thigh swelling. Secondary outcome measures included visual analogue pain score, timed up and go test, a 10 meter walk test, length of stay, blood loss, and the incidence of blood transfusions.\n\nResults: There were no statistically significant differences between the primary outcome of thigh swelling or the secondary outcome measures of postoperative pain nor mobility. Length of stay was 3.58 days (0.84) for those that received TXA compared with the control group 4.27 days (0.98) (P < .001). Intraoperative blood loss was 0.460L (SD 0.228) in the TXA group compared with the control group 0.687L (SD 0.283L) (P < .001). The estimated blood loss was 1.084L (SD 0.440) in the TXA group compared with the control group 1.394 L (SD 0.426).\n\nConclusion: TXA was not more effective than placebo on thigh swelling in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty using the anterior approach.",

However, limited clinical data are available regarding the best technique \nin terms of clinical and anatomic outcomes.\nPURPOSE: To compare the clinical and anatomic outcomes of the interference screw \n(IS) and suture anchor (SA) fixation techniques for biceps tenodesis performed \nalong with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.\nMETHODS: A total of 80 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair \nwith SLBC lesions were prospectively enrolled and randomly divided according to \nthe tenodesis method: the IS and SA groups. The primary outcome was the anatomic \nstatus of tenodesis estimated using magnetic resonance imaging or \nultrasonography. Anatomic failure of tenodesis was determined when the biceps \ntendon was not traced in the intertubercular groove directly from the insertion \nsite of the IS or SA. Secondary outcomes included functional outcomes evaluated \nwith the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, American Shoulder and Elbow \nSurgeons (ASES) score, Simple Shoulder Test (SST), Constant score, Korean \nShoulder Score (KSS), and long head of the biceps (LHB) score at least 2 years \nafter surgery.\nRESULTS: Thirty-three patients in the IS group and 34 in the SA group were \nmonitored for more than 2 years. Nine anatomic failures of tenodesis were \nobserved: 7 in the IS group and 2 in the SA group (P = .083). All postoperative \nfunctional scores improved compared with the preoperative scores and were not \nsignificantly different between the groups, including the LHB score (all P > \n.05). In a multivariate analysis using logistic regression, IS fixation (P = \n.003) and a higher work level (P = .022) were factors associated with the \nanatomic failure of tenodesis. In patients with tenodesis failure, the LHB score \n(P = .049) and the degree of Popeye deformity by the patient and examiner (P = \n.004 and .018, respectively) were statistically different compared with patients \nwith intact tenodeses.\nCONCLUSION: The IS fixation technique was not more effective than SA fixation \ntechnique in preventing anatomic failure of tenodesis in patients with SLBC \nlesions undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.",

However, limited clinical data are available regarding the best technique \nin terms of clinical and anatomic outcomes.\nPURPOSE: To compare the clinical and anatomic outcomes of the interference screw \n(IS) and suture anchor (SA) fixation techniques for biceps tenodesis performed \nalong with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.\nMETHODS: A total of 80 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair \nwith SLBC lesions were prospectively enrolled and randomly divided according to \nthe tenodesis method: the IS and SA groups. Functional outcomes were evaluated \nwith the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, American Shoulder and Elbow \nSurgeons (ASES) score, Simple Shoulder Test (SST), Constant score, Korean \nShoulder Score (KSS), and long head of the biceps (LHB) score at least 2 years \nafter surgery. The anatomic status of tenodesis was estimated using magnetic \nresonance imaging or ultrasonography, and the anatomic failure of tenodesis was \ndetermined when the biceps tendon was not traced in the intertubercular groove \ndirectly from the insertion site of the IS or SA.\nRESULTS: Thirty-three patients in the IS group and 34 in the SA group were \nmonitored for more than 2 years. All postoperative functional scores improved \nsignificantly compared with the preoperative scores (all P < .001) and were not \nsignificantly different between the groups, including the LHB score (all P > \n.05). Nine anatomic failures of tenodesis were observed: 7 in the IS group and 2 \nin the SA group ( P = .083). In a multivariate analysis using logistic \nregression, IS fixation ( P = .003) and a higher (ie, more physically demanding) \nwork level ( P = .022) were factors associated with the anatomic failure of \ntenodesis significantly. In patients with tenodesis failure, the LHB score ( P = \n.049) and the degree of Popeye deformity by the patient and examiner ( P = .004 \nand .018, respectively) were statistically different compared with patients with \nintact tenodeses.\nCONCLUSION: Care must be taken while performing biceps tenodesis in patients \nwith a higher work level; IS fixation appears to pose a higher risk in terms of \nthe anatomic failure of tenodesis than SA fixation, although functional outcomes \nwere not different.",

A growing body of evidence strongly suggests that the \nprogression from anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury to PTOA is \nmultifactorial, involving the interplay between biomechanical disturbances and \nbiochemical homeostasis of articular cartilage.\nPURPOSE: The purposes of this randomized study using an acute ACL injury model \nwere to (1) evaluate the natural progression of inflammatory and \nchondrodegenerative biomarkers, (2) evaluate the relationship between subjective \nreports of pain and inflammatory and chondrodegenerative biomarkers, and (3) \ndetermine if postinjury arthrocentesis and corticosteroid injection offer the \nability to alter this biochemical cascade.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.\nMETHODS: A total of 49 patients were randomized to 4 groups: group 1 \n(corticosteroid at 4 days after ACL injury, placebo injection of saline at 2 \nweeks), group 2 (placebo at 4 days after ACL injury, corticosteroid at 2 weeks), \ngroup 3 (corticosteroid at both time intervals), or a placebo group (saline \ninjections at both time intervals). Patient-reported outcome measures and \nsynovial biomarkers were collected at approximately 4 days, 11 days, and 5 weeks \nafter injury.

However, it is encouraging that early intervention \nwith an anti-inflammatory agent was able to affect biomarkers of chondral \ndegeneration. Should early intervention lead to meaningful changes in either the \nonset or severity of symptomatic PTOA, the current treatment paradigm for \npatients with ACL injury may have to be restructured to include early aspiration \nand intra-articular intervention.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bronchiolitis is the most common lung infection in infants and \ntreatment focuses on management of respiratory distress and hypoxia. High-flow \nwarm humidified oxygen (HFWHO) is increasingly used, but has not been rigorously \nstudied in randomised trials. We aimed to examine whether HFWHO provided \nenhanced respiratory support, thereby shortening time to weaning off oxygen.\nMETHODS: In this open, phase 4, randomised controlled trial, we recruited \nchildren aged less than 24 months with moderate bronchiolitis attending the \nemergency department of the John Hunter Hospital or the medical unit of the John \nHunter Children's Hospital in New South Wales, Australia. Patients were randomly \nallocated (1:1) via opaque sealed envelopes to HFWHO (maximum flow of 1 L/kg per \nmin to a limit of 20 L/min using 1:1 air-oxygen ratio, resulting in a maximum \nFiO2 of 0\u0412\u00b76) or standard therapy (cold wall oxygen 100% via infant nasal \ncannulae at low flow to a maximum of 2 L/min) using a block size of four and \nstratifying for gestational age at birth. The primary outcome was time from \nrandomisation to last use of oxygen therapy. All randomised children were \nincluded in the primary and secondary safety analyses. This trial is registered \nwith the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number \nACTRN12612000685819.\nFINDINGS: From July 16, 2012, to May 1, 2015, we randomly assigned 202 children \nto either HFWHO (101 children) or standard therapy (101 children). Median time \nto weaning was 24 h (95% CI 18-28) for standard therapy and 20 h (95% CI 17-34) \nfor HFWHO (hazard ratio [HR] for difference in survival distributions 0\u0412\u00b79 [95% \nCI 0\u0412\u00b77-1\u0412\u00b72]; log rank p=0\u0412\u00b761). Fewer children experienced treatment failure on \nHFWHO (14 [14%]) compared with standard therapy (33 [33%]; p=0\u0412\u00b70016); of these \nchildren, those on HFWHO were supported for longer than were those on standard \ntherapy before treatment failure (HR 0\u0412\u00b73; 95% CI 0\u0412\u00b72-0\u0412\u00b76; p<0\u0412\u00b70001). 20 (61%) of \n33 children who experienced treatment failure on standard therapy were rescued \nwith HFWHO. 12 (12%) of children on standard therapy required transfer to the \nintensive care unit compared with 14 (14%) of those on HFWHO (difference -1%; \n95% CI -7 to 16; p=0\u0412\u00b741). Four adverse events occurred (oxygen desaturation and \ncondensation inhalation in the HFWHO group, and two incidences of oxygen tubing \ndisconnection in the standard therapy group); none resulted in withdrawal from \nthe trial. No oxygen-related serious adverse events occurred. Secondary \neffectiveness outcomes are reported in the Results section.\nINTERPRETATION: HFWHO did not significantly reduce time on oxygen compared with \nstandard therapy, suggesting that early use of HFWHO does not modify the \nunderlying disease process in moderately severe bronchiolitis. HFWHO might have \na role as a rescue therapy to reduce the proportion of children requiring \nhigh-cost intensive care.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bronchiolitis is the most common lung infection in infants and \ntreatment focuses on management of respiratory distress and hypoxia. High-flow \nwarm humidified oxygen (HFWHO) is increasingly used, but has not been rigorously \nstudied in randomised trials. We aimed to examine whether HFWHO provided \nenhanced respiratory support, thereby shortening time to weaning off oxygen.\nMETHODS: In this open, phase 4, randomised controlled trial, we recruited \nchildren aged less than 24 months with moderate bronchiolitis attending the \nemergency department of the John Hunter Hospital or the medical unit of the John \nHunter Children's Hospital in New South Wales, Australia. Patients were randomly \nallocated (1:1) via opaque sealed envelopes to HFWHO (maximum flow of 1 L/kg per \nmin to a limit of 20 L/min using 1:1 air-oxygen ratio, resulting in a maximum \nFiO2 of 0\u00b76) or standard therapy (cold wall oxygen 100% via infant nasal \ncannulae at low flow to a maximum of 2 L/min) using a block size of four and \nstratifying for gestational age at birth. The primary outcome was time from \nrandomisation to last use of oxygen therapy. Secondary outcomes included treatment \nfailure, time to treatment failure, intensive care unit transfer, and adverse \nevents. All randomised children were included in the primary and secondary safety \nanalyses. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical \nTrials Registry, number ACTRN12612000685819.\nFINDINGS: From July 16, 2012, to May 1, 2015, we randomly assigned 202 children \nto either HFWHO (101 children) or standard therapy (101 children). Median time \nto weaning was 24 h (95% CI 18-28) for standard therapy and 20 h (95% CI 17-34) \nfor HFWHO (hazard ratio [HR] for difference in survival distributions 0\u00b79 [95% \nCI 0\u00b77-1\u00b72]; log rank p=0\u00b761). Treatment failure occurred in 14 (14%) children \non HFWHO compared with 33 (33%) children on standard therapy (p=0\u00b70016). 12 (12%) \nof children on standard therapy required transfer to the intensive care unit \ncompared with 14 (14%) of those on HFWHO (difference -1%; 95% CI -7 to 16; \np=0\u00b741). Four adverse events occurred (oxygen desaturation and condensation \ninhalation in the HFWHO group, and two incidences of oxygen tubing disconnection \nin the standard therapy group); none resulted in withdrawal from the trial. No \noxygen-related serious adverse events occurred.\nINTERPRETATION: HFWHO was not more effective than standard therapy on time to \nweaning off oxygen in children with moderate bronchiolitis.",

Insulin sensitivity was assessed by hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamps and cardiovascular variables were measured.\n\nResults: Uric acid decreased in both groups, but significantly more in the AP than the PP group. There were no significant differences in other variables, although glycated haemoglobin levels, diastolic blood pressure and fasting non-esterified fatty acid levels improved significantly in the PP but not in the AP group. Insulin sensitivity (M-value), C-reactive protein and fasting glucose improved significantly in the AP but not in the PP group. Total and LDL cholesterol levels and systolic blood pressure decreased significantly in both groups, and the urinary albumin excretion rate decreased from baseline in participants with microalbuminuria.\n\nConclusions: Isocaloric diets high in AP or PP allow similar improvements in metabolism and cardiovascular risk factors in people with T2DM, indicating that the differences in amino acid composition do not affect the metabolic responses to the interventions.",

Controversy has arisen as each \nconceptually differs in how the knee is balanced through bone and soft tissue \nmanagement. The objective of the present study was to compare both the frequency \nof condylar liftoff and the location of femorotibial contact from extension \nthrough midflexion between patients undergoing GB or MR TKA.\nMETHODS: A total of 24 knees (23 patients) were randomly assigned at referral to \neither a surgeon performing MR or GB TKA with the same single radius, \nposterior-stabilized implant (12 per cohort). At 1-year postoperation, patients \nunderwent biplanar radiographic imaging at 0\u0412\u00b0, 20\u0412\u00b0, 40\u0412\u00b0, and 60\u0412\u00b0 of flexion. \nCondylar liftoff, contact location, and magnitude of excursion on each condyle \nwere measured. Preoperative and postoperative clinical outcome scores were also \ncollected.\nRESULTS: There was no difference (P\u0412\u00a0= .41) in the frequency of liftoff between \ncohorts. The MR cohort had more posterior contact on the medial condyle (P < \n.01) and more anterior contact on the lateral condyle (P < .01) throughout \nflexion. Motion patterns were similar between cohorts, with similar medial (P\u0412\u00a0= \n.48) and lateral (P\u0412\u00a0= .44) excursion, which was equal in magnitude between \ncondyles for both MR (P\u0412\u00a0= .48) and GB (P\u0412\u00a0= .73). There was no difference in \nclinical outcome scores between groups.\nCONCLUSION: For this particular implant system, GB and MR appear to produce \nsimilar kinematic and patient-reported outcome results.",

Two groups were \ncreated: V-group (Vicryl\u0412\u00ae 2/0-Ethicon) and S-group (Stratafix\u0432\u201e\u045e 2/0-Ethicon). \nTime spent on closing the enterotomies was measured from first needle in until \nknot and cut (V-group) or last stitch and cut (S-group). If needed, a \nnonabsorbable \"correction\" (\"c\"; in order to close a small hiatus at the \nanastomosis) or hemostatic (\"h\") stitch was made (using a single Prolene\u0412\u00ae \n2/0-Ethicon).\nRESULTS: Average total procedure time was similar (S-group 1:01:22, V-group \n1:00:44, P\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a00.340). Closure of the enterotomy (GJA) was significantly shorter \nin the S-group (07:41\u0412\u00a0min versus 08:13\u0412\u00a0min in the V-group, P\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a00.005). Extra \nstitches (GJA) were performed in 33 patients (16.5%): 3 (h) and 20 (c) in the \nV-group and 1 (h) and 9 (c) in the S-group. Four patients in the V-group \nsuffered from postoperative intraluminal bleeding (3 self-limiting, 1 underwent \nendoscopic clipping). In the S-group, 1 patient suffered from leakage at the \nvertical transected staple line of the stomach.\nCONCLUSIONS: The use of unidirectional barbed sutures for running enterotomy \nclosure after linear stapled RYGB is feasible and safe. Significant time benefit \nwas seen regarding the closure of the GJA. Fewer additional stitches were \nnecessary and postoperative intraluminal bleeding was less encountered.",

To overcome the shortcomings of the microfracture technique, \nvarious augmentation techniques have been developed. However, their efficacies \nremain unclear.\nHYPOTHESIS: The quality of cartilage repair and clinical outcomes would be \nsuperior in patients undergoing high tibial osteotomy (HTO) with microfracture \nand collagen augmentation compared to those undergoing HTO with microfracture \nalone without collagen augmentation for the treatment of medial compartment \nosteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.\nMETHODS: Twenty-eight patients undergoing HTO were randomized into 2 groups: \nmicrofracture alone (group 1, n = 14) or microfracture with collagen \naugmentation (group 2, n = 14). At 1 year postoperatively, second-look \narthroscopic surgery and biopsy of repaired cartilage were performed at the time \nof HTO plate removal. Biopsy specimens were graded using the International \nCartilage Repair Society Visual Assessment Scale II (ICRS II). In addition, \nimaging outcomes in terms of the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage \nrepair tissue (MOCART) score were assessed based on magnetic resonance imaging \n(MRI). Finally, clinical outcomes in terms of the visual analog scale (VAS) for \npain score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International \nKnee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and Tegner activity scale score were \nevaluated.\nRESULTS: The mean ICRS II score in group 2 was significantly higher than that in \ngroup 1 (1053.2 vs 885.4, respectively; P = .002). Group 2 showed greater \nimprovement in tissue morphology, cell morphology, surface architecture, \nmiddle/deep zone assessment, and overall assessment compared with group 1 ( P < \n.050 for all comparisons). Imaging outcomes based on the MOCART score were \nsuperior in group 2 compared to those in group 1 on MRI at 1 year \npostoperatively (64.6 vs 45.4, respectively; P = .001). The degree of defect \nrepair was better in group 2 than in group 1 ( P = .040). Clinical outcomes in \nterms of the VAS for pain score, KOOS, IKDC score, and Tegner activity scale \nscore were improved in both groups without between-group differences ( P > .100 \nfor all comparisons).\nCONCLUSION: The quality of cartilage repair after microfracture with collagen \naugmentation was superior to that after microfracture alone in patients \nundergoing HTO. Clinical results after 1 year did not reflect this difference in \ntissue repair. Therefore, a longer follow-up of the cohort is needed to answer \nthis question.",

        "abstract": "Background: The use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) has demonstrated mixed clinical outcomes in randomized controlled trials when compared with hyaluronic acid (HA), an accepted nonsurgical treatment for symptomatic OA. Biological analysis of PRP has demonstrated an anti-inflammatory effect on the intra-articular environment.\n\nPurpose: To compare the clinical and biological effects of an intra-articular injection of PRP with those of an intra-articular injection of HA in patients with mild to moderate knee OA.\n\nStudy design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\n\nMethods: A total of 111 patients with symptomatic unilateral knee OA received a series of either leukocyte-poor PRP or HA injections under ultrasound guidance. Clinical data were collected before treatment and at 4 time points across a 1-year period. Synovial fluid was also collected for analysis of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers before treatment and at 12 and 24 weeks after treatment. Several measures were used to assess results: (1) Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale; (2) International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee evaluation, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, and Lysholm knee score; and (3) difference in intra-articular biochemical marker concentrations.\n\nResults: There were 49 patients randomized to treatment with PRP and 50 randomized to treatment with HA. No difference was seen between the groups in the primary outcome measure (WOMAC pain score). In the secondary outcome measure, linear contrasts identified a significantly higher IKDC score in the PRP group compared with the HA group at 24 weeks (mean \u00b1 standard error [SE], 65.5 \u00b1 3.6 vs 55.8 \u00b1 3.8, respectively; P = .013) and at final follow-up (52 weeks) (57.6 \u00b1 3.37 vs 46.6 \u00b1 3.76, respectively; P = .003). Linear contrasts also identified a statistically lower VAS score in the PRP group versus the HA group at 24 weeks (mean \u00b1 SE, 34.6 \u00b1 3.24 vs 48.6 \u00b1 3.7, respectively; P = .0096) and 52 weeks (44 \u00b1 4.6 vs 57.3 \u00b1 3.8, respectively; P = .0039). An examination of fixed effects showed that patients with mild OA and a lower body mass index had a statistically significant improvement in outcomes. In the biochemical analysis, differences between groups approached significance for interleukin-1_ (mean \u00b1 SE, 0.14 \u00b1 0.05 pg/mL [PRP] vs 0.34 \u00b1 0.16 pg/mL [HA]; P = .06) and tumor necrosis factor _ (0.08 \u00b1 0.01 pg/mL [PRP] vs 0.2 \u00b1 0.18 pg/mL [HA]; P = .068) at 12-week follow-up.\n\nConclusion: We found no difference between HA and PRP at any time point in the primary outcome measure: the patient-reported WOMAC pain score. Significant improvements were seen in other patient-reported outcome measures, with results favoring PRP over HA. Preceding a significant difference in subjective outcomes favoring PRP, there was a trend toward a decrease in 2 proinflammatory cytokines, which suggest that the anti-inflammatory properties of PRP may contribute to an improvement of symptoms.",

Participants were followed by community health workers at set intervals (weekly in months 1-3; biweekly in months 4-9; once monthly in months 10-12).\n\nResults: There was no difference in weight loss at 12 months between participants in the small change approach alone (1.1%) versus the small change PA/SA intervention (1.2%). During treatment, 9% of participants lost at least 7% of their initial body weight. Participants who reported more interval life events had a lower likelihood of losing weight (P < 0.0001). However, those randomized to the small change PA/SA intervention gained less weight (+0.3% vs. 2.3% gain; P < 0.0001).\n\nConclusions: The small change PA/SA intervention did not lead to a significant difference in weight loss in comparison to the small change approach alone. It did, however, decrease the negative impact of psychosocial stressors on weight gain among participants with more interval life events.",

A total of 101 patients received arthroscopic \nrelease (n\u0412\u00a0= 50) or US-guided PRP injections (n\u0412\u00a0= 51). Outcomes were assessed \nusing a visual analog scale for pain, the Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation \n(PRTEE), and a calibrated hand dynamometer for grip strength.\nRESULTS: Both patient groups experienced significant improvement in all \nmeasures. Between-group comparisons showed a significantly higher value in the \nPRP group only for grip strength at week 8 (P\u0412\u00a0= .0073); all other significant \ndifferences were in favor of arthroscopy: overall pain (P\u0412\u00a0= .0021), night pain \n(P\u0412\u00a0= .0013), and PRTEE score (P\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a0.0013) at week 104 and grip strength at weeks \n24, 52, and 104 (all P < .0001). Consumption of rescue pain medication was not \nsignificantly different between the groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that (1) PRP injections and \narthroscopic extensor carpi radialis brevis release are both effective in the \nshort and medium term; (2) PRP patients experienced a significant worsening of \npain at 2\u0412\u00a0years; (3) arthroscopic release ensured better long-term outcomes in \nterms of pain relief and grip strength recovery; and (4) both procedures were \nsafe and well accepted by patients.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Bariatric surgery is the only treatment option that achieves sustained weight loss in obese patients and that also has positive effects on obesity-related comorbidities. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) seems to achieve equal weight loss as laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), but there is still much debate about the quality of life (QOL) after LSG, mainly concerning the association with gastroesophageal reflux. Our hypothesis is that QOL after LSG is comparable with QOL after LRYGB.\n\nMaterials and methods: Between February 2013 and February 2014, 150 patients were randomized to undergo either LSG or LRYGB in our clinic. Differences in QOL were compared between groups by using multiple QOL questionnaires at follow-up moments preoperatively and 2 and 12 months after surgery.\n\nResults: After 12 months of follow-up, 128 patients had returned the questionnaires. Most QOL questionnaires showed significant improvement in scores between the preoperative moment and after 12 months of follow-up. The Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Questionnaire (GerdQ) score deteriorated in the LSG group after 2 months, but recovered again after 12 months. After 2 months of follow-up, the mean GerdQ score was 6.95 \u00b1 2.14 in the LSG group versus 5.50 \u00b1 1.49 in the LRYGB group (p < 0.001). After 1 year, the mean GerdQ score was 6.63 \u00b1 2.26 in the LSG group and 5.60 \u00b1 1.07 in the LRYGB group (p = 0.001).\n\nConclusion: This randomized controlled trial shows that patients who underwent LSG have significantly higher GerdQ scores at both 2 and 12 months postoperatively than patients who underwent LRYGB, whereas overall QOL did not differ significantly.",

Participants were divided into three groups: aerobic (A), aerobic-strength (AS), and control (C) group. Aerobic capacity was assessed with 12-min walk-run test (12MWRT). One-repetition maximum (1RM) test was performed to evaluation upper limb muscle strength. Lower extremity functional capacity was assessed by sit-to-stand test.\n\nResults: Weight, percent body fat (PBF), and fat mass (FM) reduced greater in the trial groups in comparison to the C group (P < 0.05). In the AS group, the reduction of fat-free mass (FFM) was significantly lower than that in the other groups. Mean changes in 12MWRT increased significantly in the intervention groups. The mean change in the sit-to-stand scores was not statistically significant between the three groups. Comparing the intervention groups showed that mean changes in 1RM variables increased in AS group (P = 0.03).\n\nConclusions: The data suggests a positive effect of exercise on weight and PBF decrease after surgery, and it leads to significant improvement on aerobic capacity. Moreover, doing resisted exercise caused greater preserving of lean mass.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Emergency department visits for skin infections in the United States \nhave increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus \n(MRSA). For cellulitis without purulent drainage, \u041e\u0406-hemolytic streptococci are \npresumed to be the predominant pathogens. It is unknown if antimicrobial \nregimens possessing in vitro MRSA activity provide improved outcomes compared \nwith treatments lacking MRSA activity.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine whether cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole \nyields a higher clinical cure rate of uncomplicated cellulitis than cephalexin \nalone.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized \nsuperiority trial in 5 US emergency departments among outpatients older than 12 \nyears with cellulitis and no wound, purulent drainage, or abscess enrolled from \nApril 2009 through June 2012. All participants had soft tissue ultrasound \nperformed at the time of enrollment to exclude abscess. Final follow-up was \nAugust 2012.\nINTERVENTIONS: Cephalexin, 500 mg 4 times daily, plus \ntrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily, for 7 days (n\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030248 \nparticipants) or cephalexin plus placebo for 7 days (n\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030248 participants).\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome determined a priori in the \nper-protocol group was clinical cure, defined as absence of these clinical \nfailure criteria at follow-up visits: fever; increase in erythema (>25%), \nswelling, or tenderness (days 3-4); no decrease in erythema, swelling, or \ntenderness (days 8-10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness \n(days 14-21). A clinically significant difference was defined as greater than \n10%.\nRESULTS: Among 500 randomized participants, 496 (99%) were included in the \nmodified intention-to-treat analysis and 411 (82.2%) in the per-protocol \nanalysis (median age, 40 years [range, 15-78 years]; 58.4% male; 10.9% had \ndiabetes). Median length and width of erythema were 13.0 cm and 10.0 cm. In the \nper-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 182 (83.5%) of 218 \nparticipants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 165 \n(85.5%) of 193 in the cephalexin group (difference, -2.0%; 95% CI, -9.7% to \n5.7%; P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030.50). In the modified intention-to-treat population, clinical cure \noccurred in 189 (76.2%) of 248 participants in the cephalexin plus \ntrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 171 (69.0%) of 248 in the cephalexin \ngroup (difference, 7.3%; 95% CI, -1.0% to 15.5%; P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030.07). Between-group adverse \nevent rates and secondary outcomes through 7 to 9 weeks, including overnight \nhospitalization, recurrent skin infections, and similar infection in household \ncontacts, did not differ significantly.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with uncomplicated cellulitis, the use \nof cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared to cephalexin alone \ndid not result in higher rates of clinical resolution of cellulitis in the \nper-protocol analysis. However, because imprecision around the findings in the \nmodified intention-to-treat analysis included a clinically important difference \nfavoring cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, further research may be \nneeded.",

For cellulitis without purulent drainage, \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci are \npresumed to be the predominant pathogens. It is unknown if antimicrobial \nregimens possessing in vitro MRSA activity provide improved outcomes compared \nwith treatments lacking MRSA activity.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine whether cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole \nyields a higher clinical cure rate of uncomplicated cellulitis than cephalexin \nalone.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized \nsuperiority trial in 5 US emergency departments among outpatients older than 12 \nyears with cellulitis and no wound, purulent drainage, or abscess enrolled from \nApril 2009 through June 2012. All participants had soft tissue ultrasound \nperformed at the time of enrollment to exclude abscess. Final follow-up was \nAugust 2012.\nINTERVENTIONS: Cephalexin, 500 mg 4 times daily, plus \ntrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily, for 7 days (n = 248 \nparticipants) or cephalexin plus placebo for 7 days (n = 248 participants).\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome determined a priori in the \nper-protocol group was clinical cure, defined as absence of these clinical \nfailure criteria at follow-up visits: fever; increase in erythema (>25%), \nswelling, or tenderness (days 3-4); no decrease in erythema, swelling, or \ntenderness (days 8-10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness \n(days 14-21). A clinically significant difference was defined as greater than \n10%.\nRESULTS: Among 500 randomized participants, 496 (99%) were included in the \nmodified intention-to-treat analysis and 411 (82.2%) in the per-protocol \nanalysis (median age, 40 years [range, 15-78 years]; 58.4% male; 10.9% had \ndiabetes). Median length and width of erythema were 13.0 cm and 10.0 cm. In the \nper-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 182 (83.5%) of 218 \nparticipants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 165 \n(85.5%) of 193 in the cephalexin group (difference, -2.0%; 95% CI, -9.7% to \n5.7%; P = .50). Between-group adverse event rates and secondary outcomes through \n7 to 9 weeks, including overnight hospitalization, recurrent skin infections, \nand similar infection in household contacts, did not differ significantly.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was not \nmore effective than cephalexin alone in patients with uncomplicated cellulitis.",

Primary (BMI value at the 95th percentile [%BMIp95 \n]) and secondary outcomes were measured at baseline, 3 months (Intensive Phase), \nand 12 months (Transition Phase).\nRESULTS: For age group 6-8, MEND/CATCH6-12 resulted in greater improvement in \n%BMIp95 than Next Steps during the Intensive Phase. Effect size (95% CI) was \n-1.94 (-3.88, -0.01) percentage points (P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u20300.05). For age group 9-12, effect \nsize was -1.38 (-2.87, 0.16) percentage points for %BMIp95 (P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u20300.07). MEND2-5 \ndid not differentially affect %BMIp95 . Attendance averaged 52% and 22% during \nthe Intensive and Transition Phases. Intervention compliance was inversely \ncorrelated to change in %BMIp95 during the Intensive Phase (P\u0432\u0402\u2030<\u0432\u0402\u20300.05). In the \nTransition Phase, %BMIp95 was maintained or rebounded in both programs \n(P\u0432\u0402\u2030<\u0432\u0402\u20300.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: MEND/CATCH6-12 was more efficacious for BMI reduction at 3 months \nbut not 12 months compared to Next Steps in underserved children.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial was conducted to determine \ncomparative efficacy of a 12-month community-centered weight management program \n(MEND2-5 for ages 2-5 or MEND/CATCH6-12 for ages 6-12) against a primary \ncare-centered program (Next Steps) in low-income children.METHODS: Five hundred forty-nine Hispanic and black children (BMI \u2265 85th \npercentile), stratified by age groups (2-5, 6-8, and 9-12 years), were randomly \nassigned to MEND2-5 (27 contact hours)/MEND/CATCH6-12 (121.5 contact hours) or \nNext Steps (8 contact hours). The primary outcome was BMI value at the 95th percentile \n(%BMIp95) at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were measured at baseline, 3 months \n(Intensive Phase), and 12 months (Transition Phase).\nRESULTS: At 12 months, there was no significant difference in %BMIp95 between \nMEND/CATCH6-12 and Next Steps for any age group. For the primary outcome at 12 months, \neffect sizes were not statistically significant across all age groups. MEND2-5 \ndid not differentially affect %BMIp95. Attendance averaged 52% and 22% during \nthe Intensive and Transition Phases. Intervention compliance was inversely \ncorrelated to change in %BMIp95 during the Intensive Phase (P < 0.05). In the \nTransition Phase, %BMIp95 was maintained or rebounded in both programs \n(P < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: MEND/CATCH6-12 was not more effective than Next Steps on the primary \noutcome of %BMIp95 at 12 months in underserved children.",

Three hundred \nfifty-five adult, unconscious patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were \nenrolled from February 16, 2013, to June 1, 2016, with final follow-up on \nDecember 27, 2016.\nINTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to TTM (33\u0432\u0402\u2030\u0412\u00b1\u0432\u0402\u20301\u0412\u00b0C) for 48 hours (n\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030176) \nor 24 hours (n\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030179), followed by gradual rewarming of 0.5\u0412\u00b0C per hour until \nreaching 37\u0412\u00b0C.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was 6-month neurologic outcome, \nwith a Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) score of 1 or 2 used to define \nfavorable outcome. Secondary outcomes included 6-month mortality, including time \nto death, the occurrence of adverse events, and intensive care unit resource \nuse.\nRESULTS: In 355 patients who were randomized (mean age, 60 years; 295 [83%] \nmen), 351 (99%) completed the trial. Of these patients, 69% (120/175) in the \n48-hour group had a favorable outcome at 6 months compared with 64% (112/176) in \nthe 24-hour group (difference, 4.9%; 95% CI, -5% to 14.8%; relative risk [RR], \n1.08; 95% CI, 0.93-1.25; P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030.33).

Patient-reported outcome \nmeasures for pain, satisfaction, and functional outcomes were recorded \npostoperatively.\nRESULTS: A total of 70 of 74 consecutive patients who underwent shoulder \narthroplasty were included in the study. The LB group had equivalent narcotic \nuse, pain scores, and time to first narcotic rescue compared with the CISB group \nwithin the first 24 hours (P\u0432\u0402\u2030>\u0432\u0402\u2030.05). The LB group had higher American Shoulder \nand Elbow Surgeons score and Penn Shoulder Score at final follow-up.

Randomization was by minimization (age and \nethnicity), with participants assigned to an intense intervention group \n(home-based assessments at 6-month intervals and a 12-month multidisciplinary \nprogram with weekly group sessions) or to a minimal-intensity control group with \nhome-based assessments and advice at each 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome \nwas the change in BMI standard deviation score (SDS) at 12 months from baseline. \nA mixed model analysis was undertaken, incorporating all 6- and 12-month data.\nRESULTS: Two hundred and three children were randomly assigned (47% M\u0414\u0403ori, 43% \nNew Zealand European, 53% female, 28% from the most deprived quintile, mean age \n10.7 years, mean BMI SDS 3.12).

Participants completed a 4-week smartphone headache diary at baseline, posttreatment (16-20 wk), and follow-up (32-36 wk). The primary outcome was posttreatment change in migraine days per month, analyzed via linear mixed effects models.\n\nResults: Of 110 participants randomly assigned, 85 (78%) and 80 (73%) completed posttreatment and follow-up. The BWL group achieved greater weight loss (mean [95% CI] in kilograms) than the ME group at posttreatment (-3.8 [-2.5 to -5.0] vs. + 0.9 [-0.4 to 2.2], P < 0.001) and follow-up (-3.2 [-2.0 to -4.5] vs. + 1.1 [-0.2 to 2.4], P < 0.001).

        "abstract": "Objective: The objective of this study was to test whether behavioral weight loss (BWL) intervention decreases headaches in women with comorbid migraine and overweight or obesity.\n\nMethods: This randomized, single-blind trial allocated women 18 to 50 years old with 4 to 20 migraine days per month and a BMI = 25.0-49.9 kg/m2 to 16 weeks of BWL (n = 54), which targeted exercise and eating behaviors for weight loss, or to migraine education control (ME, n = 56), which delivered didactic instruction on migraine and treatments. Participants completed a 4-week smartphone headache diary at baseline, posttreatment (16-20 wk), and follow-up (32-36 wk). The primary outcome was posttreatment change in migraine days per month, analyzed via linear mixed effects models.\n\nResults: Of 110 participants randomly assigned, 85 (78%) and 80 (73%) completed posttreatment and follow-up. Although the BWL group achieved greater weight loss (mean [95% CI] in kilograms) than the ME group at posttreatment (-3.8 [-2.5 to -5.0] vs. + 0.9 [-0.4 to 2.2], P < 0.001) and follow-up (-3.2 [-2.0 to -4.5] vs. + 1.1 [-0.2 to 2.4], P < 0.001), there were no significant group (BWL vs. ME) differences (mean [95% CI]) in migraine days per month at posttreatment (-3.0 [-2.0 to -4.0] vs. -4.0 [-2.9 to -5.0], P = 0.185) or follow-up (-3.8 [-2.7 to -4.8] vs. -4.4 [-3.4 to -5.5], P = 0.378).\n\nConclusions: Contrary to hypotheses, BWL and ME yielded similar, sustained reductions in migraine headaches. Future research should evaluate whether adding BWL to standard pharmacological and/or nonpharmacological migraine treatment approaches yields greater benefits.",

Liposomal bupivacaine may provide prolonged analgesic \nduration when injected into the surrounding tissues. The purpose of this study \nwas to compare the analgesic efficacy and serum bupivacaine levels of a \ncontinuous femoral nerve block (CFNB) with bupivacaine to PAI with liposomal \nbupivacaine.\nMETHODS: Sixty-five patients undergoing primary unilateral total knee \narthroplasty were randomized into 2 groups: (1) CFNB and PAI with bupivacaine \n(CFNB group) or (2) PAI with bupivacaine:liposomal bupivacaine mixture at the \nend of surgery (LB group). The primary outcome was pain intensity at maximum \nknee flexion 24 hours following surgery. Secondary outcomes included pain \nintensities at rest and movement at timed intervals and serum bupivacaine \nlevels.\nRESULTS: Patients in the CFNB group experienced lower pain scores at maximum \nknee flexion at 24 hours (7.91; 95% confidence interval, 7.19-8.61) compared to \nthe LB group (8.95; 95% confidence interval, 8.42-9.48; P = .02).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Local periarticular infiltration (PAI) analgesia has emerged as an \nimportant component of multimodal approaches to treat total knee arthroplasty \npostoperative pain. Liposomal bupivacaine may provide prolonged analgesic \nduration when injected into the surrounding tissues. The purpose of this study \nwas to compare the analgesic efficacy and serum bupivacaine levels of a \ncontinuous femoral nerve block (CFNB) with bupivacaine to PAI with liposomal \nbupivacaine.\nMETHODS: Sixty-five patients undergoing primary unilateral total knee \narthroplasty were randomized into 2 groups: (1) CFNB and PAI with bupivacaine \n(CFNB group) or (2) PAI with bupivacaine:liposomal bupivacaine mixture at the \nend of surgery (LB group). The primary outcome was pain intensity at maximum \nknee flexion 24\u0412\u00a0hours following surgery. Secondary outcomes included pain \nintensities at rest and movement at timed intervals and serum bupivacaine \nlevels.\nRESULTS: Patients in the CFNB group experienced lower pain scores at maximum \nknee flexion at 24\u0412\u00a0hours (7.91; 95% confidence interval, 7.19-8.61) compared to \nthe LB group (8.95; 95% confidence interval, 8.42-9.48; P\u0412\u00a0= .02). The mean peak \nserum bupivacaine level in the LB group up to 72\u0412\u00a0hours was 0.55 \u041e\u0458g/mL versus 1.4 \n\u041e\u0458g/mL for CFNB group (P\u0412\u00a0= .0008) with one patient in the CFNB group exceeding \nthe reported minimum serum bupivacaine threshold for toxicity.\nCONCLUSION: While similar pain control was observed on the day of surgery for \nboth groups, patients with a CFNB experienced lower pain intensities during \nmaximum knee flexion at 24\u0412\u00a0hours. Total serum concentrations in LB group \nremained below the toxicity threshold over the study period.",

Severe obesity is considered a state of meta-inflammation \nassociated with obesity that influences the development of chronic-degenerative \ndiseases.\nOBJECTIVE: We aimed to establish the immunometabolic differences in bariatric \npatients and to determine whether cellular immunity is associated with metabolic \nchanges.\nMETHODOLOGY: We conducted an observational study in patients who underwent \nlaparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass \n(LRYGB). We explored the differences in the immunometabolic profile before and \nafter surgery in the study group, by surgical technique, and we evaluated the \nchanges in immunological variables as a function of metabolic variables with \ncorrelation analysis.\nRESULTS: The follow-up rate was 88.7%.

Severe obesity is considered a state of meta-inflammation \nassociated with obesity that influences the development of chronic-degenerative \ndiseases.\nOBJECTIVE: We aimed to establish the immunometabolic differences in bariatric \npatients and to determine whether cellular immunity is associated with metabolic \nchanges.\nMETHODOLOGY: We conducted an observational study in patients who underwent \nlaparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass \n(LRYGB). We explored the differences in the immunometabolic profile before and \nafter surgery in the study group, by surgical technique, and we evaluated the \nchanges in immunological variables as a function of metabolic variables with \ncorrelation analysis.\nRESULTS: The follow-up rate was 88.7%. After the intervention, there were \nchanges in cellular immunity, with a decrease in effector T lymphocytes \n(CD8+CD28-) and an increase in B lymphocytes, memory helper T cells, and \ncytotoxic T lymphocytes. LSG resulted in a greater decrease in (CD4+CD62-)\u0432\u0402\u2030T \nlymphocytes compared with LRYGB. Patients who underwent surgery with LRYGB \npresented greater clinical and metabolic improvements, as well as improvement of \nobesity-associated medical problems. Women who underwent LRYGB showed a greater \nreduction in fat-free mass compared with women who underwent LSG.\nCONCLUSION: Bariatric surgery, mainly LRYGB, leads to immunometabolic changes \nand improves associated medical problems.",
