        "abstract": "Purpose\nTo determine if anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is superior to anatomic single-bundle reconstruction in restoring the stabilities and functions of the knee joint.\nMethods\nA prospective randomized clinical study was done to compare the results of 32 cases of anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction and 34 cases of anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction with average follow-up of 16.3 \u0412\u00b1 3.1\u0412\u00a0months. Tunnel placements of all the cases were measured on 3D CT. Clinical results were collected after reconstruction; graft's appearance, meniscus status and cartilage state under arthroscopy were compared and analysed too.\nResults\nTunnel placements, confirmed with 3D CT, were in the anatomic positions as described in literature both in SB and DB group. No differences were found between SB and DB groups in clinical outcome scores, pivot shift test and KT 1000\u0412\u00a0measurements (average side-to-side difference for anterior tibial translation was 0.7\u0412\u00a0mm in SB group and 1.0\u0412\u00a0mm in DB group). More than 70 % of the single-bundle graft and AM bundle graft in DB group appeared excellent, but only 44.1 % of PL bundle grafts in DB group were excellent and 11.8 % were in poor state. No new menisci tear was found either in SB or DB group, however, in DB group cartilage damages in medial patella-femoral joint occurred in 38.2 % cases. This rate was significantly higher than in the SB group which is only 9.3 %.\nConclusion\nBoth single- and double-bundle anatomic ACL reconstruction can restore the knee's stability and functions very well. However, more incidences of poor PL status and medial patellar-femoral cartilage damage may occur in double-bundle ACL reconstruction.",

Among all patients, median intubation duration in seconds was significantly higher for the GVL group (median, 56; interquartile range, 40-81) than for the DL group (median, 40; interquartile range, 24-68) (p < 0.001). Among those with severe head injuries, median intubation duration in seconds was also significantly higher for the GVL group (median, 74) than for the DL group (median, 65) (p < 0.003). Correspondingly, this group also experienced a greater incidence of low oxygen saturations of 80% or less (27 [50%] of 54 for the GVL group and 15 [24%] of 63 for the DL group; p = 0.004). There were no significant differences between the two groups in first-pass success (80% for GVL and 81% for DL, p = 0.46).\n\nConclusion: Use of the GlideScope did not influence survival to hospital discharge among all patients and was associated with longer intubation times than direct laryngoscopy. Among the video laryngoscope cohort, a smaller subgroup of severe head injury trauma patients identified retrospectively seemed to be associated with a greater incidence of hypoxia of 80% or less and mortality.",

No significant differences in the clinical results for the constant scores, the forearm supination and elbow flexion strength indices, Popeye sign, cramping pain and satisfaction level were found between the groups. However, tenotomy required a shorter surgical time (40.4 \u00b1 4.0 vs. 50.4 \u00b1 5.9 min, P < 0.001) and resulted in faster pain relief (3.1 \u00b1 1.8 vs. 4.8 \u00b1 1.9, P < 0.001).\n\nConclusion: Both tenotomy and tenodesis are effective and equal for the treatment of long head biceps lesions.

        "abstract": "Background: The infrapatellar fat pad is one of the structures that obscures exposure in minimally invasive total knee arthroplasty (MIS TKA). Most MIS TKA surgeons (and many surgeons who use other approaches as well) excise the fat pad for better exposure of the knee. There is still controversy about the result of fat pad excision on patella baja, pain, and function.\n\nQuestions/purposes: In the setting of a randomized controlled trial, we sought to determine whether infrapatellar fat pad excision during MIS TKA causes (1) patellar tendon shortening (as measured by patella baja); (2) increased anterior knee pain; (3) decreases in the Knee Society Score or functional subscore; or (4) more patella-related complications.\n\nMethods: We randomized 90 patients undergoing MIS TKA at one institution into two groups. In one group, 45 patients underwent MIS TKA with complete infrapatellar fat pad excision and in the other group, 45 patients received MIS TKA without infrapatellar fat pad excision. The patella was selectively resurfaced in these patients; there was no difference between the groups in terms of the percentage of patients whose patellae were resurfaced. We measured patellar tendon shortening, knee flexion, anterior knee pain, Knee Society Score (KSS), functional subscore, and patellar complications at preoperative and postoperative periods of 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year; complete followup data were available on 86% of patients (77 of 90) who were enrolled.\n\nResults: At the final followup, no significant differences were observed in patellar tendon shortening, KSS, functional subscore, or knee flexion in either group. However, patients with their infrapatellar fat pad excised experienced more anterior knee pain (8.3% versus 0%; p = 0.03; 95% confidence interval, -0.007 to 0.174) at the end of the study. No patellar complications were found in either group.\n\nConclusions: Infrapatellar fat pad excision in MIS TKA resulted in an increasing small percentage of patients with anterior knee pain after surgery. Surgeons should keep the fat pad if excellent exposure can be achieved but resect it if needed to improve exposure during TKA.",

        "abstract": "Background: The infrapatellar fat pad is one of the structures that obscures exposure in minimally invasive total knee arthroplasty (MIS TKA). Most MIS TKA surgeons (and many surgeons who use other approaches as well) excise the fat pad for better exposure of the knee. There is still controversy about the result of fat pad excision on patella baja, pain, and function.\n\nQuestions/purposes: In the setting of a randomized controlled trial, we sought to determine whether infrapatellar fat pad excision during MIS TKA causes (1) patellar tendon shortening (as measured by patella baja); (2) increased anterior knee pain; (3) decreases in the Knee Society Score or functional subscore; or (4) more patella-related complications.\n\nMethods: We randomized 90 patients undergoing MIS TKA at one institution into two groups. In one group, 45 patients underwent MIS TKA with complete infrapatellar fat pad excision and in the other group, 45 patients received MIS TKA without infrapatellar fat pad excision. The primary outcome was patellar tendon shortening. Secondary outcomes included knee flexion, anterior knee pain, Knee Society Score (KSS), functional subscore, and patellar complications. The patella was selectively resurfaced in these patients; there was no difference between the groups in terms of the percentage of patients whose patellae were resurfaced. We measured outcomes at preoperative and postoperative periods of 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year; complete followup data were available on 86% of patients (77 of 90) who were enrolled.\n\nResults: At the final followup, no significant differences were observed in patellar tendon shortening between groups. No significant differences were observed in KSS, functional subscore, or knee flexion in either group. Patients with their infrapatellar fat pad excised experienced more anterior knee pain (8.3% versus 0%; p = 0.03; 95% confidence interval, -0.007 to 0.174) at the end of the study. No patellar complications were found in either group.\n\nConclusions: Infrapatellar fat pad excision was not more effective than fat pad preservation on patellar tendon shortening in patients undergoing MIS TKA.",

We seek to \ndetermine whether a scalable, low-cost, unidirectional, text message-based \nmobile health intervention (TExT-MED) improves clinical outcomes, increases \nhealthy behaviors, and decreases ED utilization in a safety net population.\nMETHODS: We conducted an randomized controlled trial of 128 adult patients with \npoorly controlled diabetes (glycosylated hemoglobin [Hb A1C] level \u0432\u2030\u04908%) in an \nurban, public ED. The TExT-MED group received 2 daily text messages for 6 months \nin English or Spanish. The primary outcome was change in Hb A1C level. Secondary \noutcomes included changes in medication adherence, self-efficacy, performance of \nself-care tasks, quality of life, diabetes-specific knowledge, ED utilization, \nand patient satisfaction.\nRESULTS: Hb A1C level decreased by 1.05% in the TExT-MED group compared with \n0.60% in the controls (\u041e\u201d0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.27 to 1.17) at 6 \nmonths. Secondary outcomes favored the TExT-MED group, with the most sizable \nchange observed in self-reported medication adherence (as measured by the \nMorisky Medication Adherence Scale, an 8-point validated scale with higher \nscores representing better adherence), which improved from 4.5 to 5.4 in the \nTExT-MED group compared with a net decrease of -0.1 in the controls (\u041e\u201d1.1 [95% \nCI 0.1 to 2.1]). Effects were larger among Spanish speakers for both medication \nadherence (1.1 versus -0.3; \u041e\u201d1.4; 95% CI 0.2 to 2.7) and Hb A1C (-1.2% versus \n-0.4%) in the TExT-MED group. The proportion of patients who used emergency \nservices trended lower in the TExT-MED group (35.9% versus 51.6%; \u041e\u201d15.7%; 95% CI \n9.4% to 22%). Overall, 93.6% of respondents enjoyed TExT-MED and 100% would \nrecommend it to family/friends.\nCONCLUSION: The TExT-MED program did not result in a statistically significant \nimprovement in Hb A1C. However, trends toward improvement in the primary outcome \nof Hb A1C and other secondary outcomes, including quality of life, were \nobserved, the most pronounced being improved medication adherence. TExT-MED also \ndecreased ED utilization. These findings were magnified in the Spanish-speaking \nsubgroup. Technologies such as TExT-MED represent highly scalable, low-cost, and \nwidely accessible solutions for safety-net ED populations.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Posterior-cruciate-ligament-retaining (PCR) and \nposterior-cruciate-ligament-stabilized (PS) arthroplasties are two major common \npractices in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The hypothesis of the present study \nwas that compared with the PCR technique, the PS technique is associated with a \nhigher amount of postoperative blood loss and greater need for blood transfusion \nin cemented TKA.\nMETHODS: In this prospective, randomized study, 100 patients diagnosed with \nprimary knee osteoarthritis were randomly assigned to either the PCR group \n(Group I) or the PS group (Group II). The exclusion criteria were \nrheumatological joint disease, previous knee surgery, anticoagulant therapy and \nhypertension. There were no significant differences in age, body mass index and \ngender, between the groups. The haemoglobin and haematocrit levels of each \npatient were recorded preoperatively and on postoperative days 1, 3 and 5. The \npostoperative suction drainage and blood transfusion volumes were also recorded.\nRESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in haemoglobin or \nhaematocrit levels between the groups on postoperative days 1, 3 and 5. There \nwere also no statistically significant differences in the total measured blood \nloss volume, postoperative drainage amounts or transfusion rates between the \ngroups.\nCONCLUSION: Use of the PS technique during cemented TKA does not appear to \ninfluence the amount of perioperative blood loss or the need for postoperative \nblood transfusion in general. The clinical relevance of this study is that the \ndifference in blood loss between the PCR and PS techniques does not need to be \nconsidered by surgeons when performing TKA.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Posterior-cruciate-ligament-retaining (PCR) and \nposterior-cruciate-ligament-stabilized (PS) arthroplasties are two major common \npractices in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The hypothesis of the present study \nwas that compared with the PCR technique, the PS technique is associated with a \nhigher amount of postoperative blood loss and greater need for blood transfusion \nin cemented TKA.\nMETHODS: In this prospective, randomized study, 100 patients diagnosed with \nprimary knee osteoarthritis were randomly assigned to either the PCR group \n(Group I) or the PS group (Group II). The exclusion criteria were \nrheumatological joint disease, previous knee surgery, anticoagulant therapy and \nhypertension. There were no significant differences in age, body mass index and \ngender, between the groups. The haemoglobin and haematocrit levels of each \npatient were recorded preoperatively and on postoperative days 1, 3 and 5. The \npostoperative suction drainage and blood transfusion volumes were also recorded.\nRESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in haemoglobin or \nhaematocrit levels between the groups on postoperative days 1, 3 and 5. There \nwere also no statistically significant differences in the total measured blood \nloss volume, postoperative drainage amounts or transfusion rates between the \ngroups.\nCONCLUSION: The PS technique was not more effective than the PCR technique in \nreducing postoperative blood loss or blood transfusion requirements in patients \nwith primary knee osteoarthritis undergoing cemented TKA.",

Patients were assigned to either group, with odd-numbered patients going to the knot-tying suture arm and even-numbered patients assigned to the knotless arm. Outcomes included the Constant score, the visual analog scale (VAS) score, patient satisfaction score, and range of motion in forward flexion and external rotation with the arm in adduction. Redislocations or subluxations with the 2 techniques was also studied.\n\nResults: Both groups showed a statistically significant improvement between the preoperative and postoperative VAS scores and Constant scores. In the knot-tying suture group, the VAS score improved from 2.5 \u00b1 2.3 to 0.7 \u00b1 0.5 (P < .05) and the Constant score improved from 64 \u00b1 7 to 92 \u00b1 10 (P < .05). In the knotless group, the VAS score improved from 2.8 \u00b1 2.5 to 0.9 \u00b1 0.6 (P < .05), and the Constant score improved from 62 \u00b1 6 to 89 \u00b1 9 (P < .05). The patient satisfaction scores were 6.9 and 7.1 for the knot tying and knotless groups, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found when comparing the outcomes between the 2 groups. The change in the range of forward flexion and external rotation was also similar in the 2 groups. There was also no difference in recurrence or redislocation rates.\n\nConclusions: Both the knot-tying and knotless suture anchors groups showed statistically significant and similar improvement in VAS and Constant scores. Both anchors provided reasonable outcomes. The knotless suture anchor is a good alternative to knot-tying suture anchors so that arthroscopic Bankart repairs can be performed without knot tying.",

Intraoperative data \nincluding tear size, repair configuration, and concomitant procedures were \nrecorded. Follow-up examination was performed at regular intervals up to 2 \nyears. Preoperative imaging was reviewed to classify the acromial morphologic \ntype, acromial angle, and lateral acromial angulation.\nRESULTS: A total of 114 patients were initially enrolled in the study, and 95 \n(83%; 43 nonacromioplasty, 52 acromioplasty) were available for a minimum 2-year \nfollow-up. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics, \nincluding number of tendons torn, repair configuration, concomitant procedures, \nand acromion type and angles. Within groups, there was a significant (P < .001) \nimprovement in all functional outcome scores from preoperatively to all \nfollow-up time points, including 2 years, for the nonacromioplasty and \nacromioplasty groups (ASES score: 55.1-91.5, 48.8-89.0; Constant score: \n48.3-75.0, 51.9-78.7, respectively). There were no significant differences in \nfunctional outcomes between nonacromioplasty and acromioplasty groups or between \nsubjects with different acromial features at any time point.\nCONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrate no difference in clinical \noutcomes after rotator cuff repair with or without acromioplasty at 2 years \npostoperatively.",

Eligible patients with \nED nausea and vomiting were randomized to receive 4 mg intravenous ondansetron, \n20 mg intravenous metoclopramide, or saline solution placebo. Primary outcome \nwas mean change in visual analog scale (VAS) rating of nausea severity from \nenrollment to 30 minutes after study drug administration.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of different loads of knee extensor open \nkinetic chain resistance training on anterior knee laxity and function in the \nACL-injured (ACLI) knee.\nMETHODS: Fifty-eight ACLI subjects were randomised to one of three (12-week \nduration) training groups. The STAND group trained according to a standardised \nrehabilitation protocol. Subjects in the LOW and HIGH group trained as did the \nSTAND group but with the addition of seated knee extensor open kinetic chain \nresistance training at loads of 2 sets of 20 repetition maximum (RM) and 20 sets \nof 2RM, respectively. Anterior knee laxity and measurements of physical and \nsubjective function were performed at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks. Thirty-six \nsubjects were tested at both baseline and 12 weeks (STAND n = 13, LOW n = 11, \nHIGH n = 12).\nRESULTS: The LOW group demonstrated a reduction in 133 N anterior knee laxity \nbetween baseline and 12 weeks testing when compared to the HIGH and the STAND \ngroups (p = 0.009). Specifically, the trained-untrained knee laxity decreased an \naverage of approximately 5 mm in the LOW group while remaining the same in the \nother two groups.\nCONCLUSION: Twelve weeks of knee extensor open kinetic chain resistance training \nat loads of 2 sets of 20RM led to a reduction in anterior knee laxity in the \nACLI knee. This reduction in laxity does not appear to offer any significant \nshort-term functional advantages when compared to a standard rehabilitation \nprotocol. These results indicate that knee laxity can be decreased with \nresistance training of the thigh muscles.",

Postoperatively, residual leg length and global and \nfemoral offset discrepancies were analyzed on magnification-corrected \nradiographs of the pelvis by an independent and blinded examiner using digital \nplanning software. Accuracy was defined as the relative postoperative difference \nbetween the surgically treated and the unaffected contralateral side for leg \nlength and offset, respectively; precision was defined as the absolute \npostoperative deviation of leg length and global and femoral offset regardless \nof lengthening or shortening of leg length and offset throughout the THA. All \nanalyses were performed per intention-to-treat.\nRESULTS: For the primary outcome of relative accuracy of leg length restoration, \nthere was a mean difference of 0.2 mm (95% CI, -1.0 to +1.4 mm; p = 0.729) \nbetween fluoroscopy and navigation. For secondary outcomes, global offset showed \na mean difference of 0.2 mm (95% CI, -0.9 to +1.3 mm; p = 0.740) and femoral \noffset showed a mean difference of 1.7 mm (95% CI, +0.4 to +2.9 mm; p = 0.008). \nFor the absolute precision of leg length and global and femoral offset \nequalization, there was a mean difference of 1.7 \u00b1 0.3 mm (p < 0.001) between \nfluoroscopy and navigation. The biomechanical reconstruction with a residual leg \nlength and global and femoral offset discrepancy less than 5 mm and less than 8 \nmm, respectively, succeeded in 93% and 98%, respectively, in the navigation \ngroup and in 54% and 95%, respectively, in the fluoroscopy group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Imageless navigation was not more effective than intraoperative \nfluoroscopy for leg length restoration in patients undergoing MIS THA with the \npatient in the lateral decubitus position.",

The primary end point was the time to \nrecovery of normal painless walking without requirement for analgesic drug. \nSecondary end points were time to return to sport activity, pain, analgesic \nconsumption, and ankle edema (bimalleolar and midfoot circumferences).\nRESULTS: We randomized 126 patients and analyzed 117 patients (60 in the placebo \ngroup and 57 in the compression group). The median time to normal painless \nwalking was not significantly decreased (P = .16). No significant differences \nwere observed in pain, analgesic consumption, and bimalleolar and midfoot \ncircumferences. No safety issue was reported.\nCONCLUSIONS: Compression stockings were not more effective than placebo in \nreducing time to recovery of normal painless walking in patients with ankle \nsprain.",

The primary \nendpoint was defined as meeting predetermined discharge eligibility criteria \nwithin 6 hours of study drug administration.

A comparison of \nTT at the last follow-up (revision or 2 years) found no difference between the \nHHRIs (P = .12). Periprosthetic BMD decreased initially but increased \ncontinuously after 6 months for both HHRIs. At 2 years, BMD was 48% higher \naround the Copeland HHRI (P = .005).

(DePuy Int, Warsaw, IN, USA) \nhumeral head resurfacing implants (HHRIs).\nMETHODS: The study randomly allocated 32 patients (13 women), mean age 63 years \n(range, 39-82 years), with shoulder osteoarthritis to a Copeland (n = 14) or \nGlobal C.A.P. (n = 18) HHRI. The primary outcome was implant migration measured \nby total translation (TT). Secondary outcomes included bone mineral density, \nlength of glenohumeral offset, Constant Shoulder Score (CSS), and the Western \nOntario Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder Index (WOOS). Patients were monitored for \n2 years with radiostereometry, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, CSS, and WOOS. \nLGHO was measured preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively.\nRESULTS: At 2 years, total translation (TT) was 0.48 mm (standard deviation \n[SD], 0.21 mm) for the Copeland and 0.82 mm (SD, 0.46 mm) for the Global C.A.P. \n(P = .06). Five HHRI were revised. Periprosthetic BMD decreased initially but \nincreased continuously after 6 months for both HHRIs. At 2 years, BMD was 48% \nhigher around the Copeland HHRI (P = .005). The mean difference in LGHO was \nsignificantly higher for the Copeland than for the Global C.A.P. HHRI (P = .02). \nClinical results evaluated with CSS and WOOS improved over time for both implant \ngroups (P < .01), with no differences between the groups.\nCONCLUSION: The Copeland HHRI was not more effective than the Global C.A.P. HHRI \non implant migration in patients with shoulder osteoarthritis.",

We \nexamined the ability of 1 dose of benralizumab, an investigational \nantiinterleukin 5 receptor \u041e\u00b1 monoclonal antibody, to reduce recurrence after \nacute asthma exacerbations.\nMETHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, eligible \nsubjects presented to the ED with an asthma exacerbation, had partial response \nto treatment, and greater than or equal to 1 additional exacerbation within the \nprevious year. Subjects received 1 intravenous infusion of placebo (n = 38) or \nbenralizumab (0.3 mg/kg, n = 36 or 1.0 mg/kg, n = 36) added to outpatient \nmanagement. The primary outcome was the proportion of subjects with greater than \nor equal to 1 exacerbation at 12 weeks in placebo vs the combined benralizumab \ngroups. Other outcomes included the time-weighted rate of exacerbations at week \n12, adverse events, blood eosinophil counts, asthma symptom changes, and health \ncare resource utilization.\nRESULTS: The proportion of subjects with greater than or equal to 1 asthma \nexacerbation at 12 weeks was not different between placebo and the combined \nbenralizumab groups (38.9% vs 33.3%; P = .67). However, compared with placebo, \nbenralizumab reduced asthma exacerbation rates by 49% (3.59 vs 1.82; P = .01) \nand exacerbations resulting in hospitalization by 60% (1.62 vs 0.65; P = .02) in \nthe combined groups. Benralizumab reduced blood eosinophil counts but did not \naffect other outcomes, while demonstrating an acceptable safety profile.\nCONCLUSIONS: When added to usual care, 1 dose of benralizumab reduced the rate \nand severity of exacerbations experienced over 12 weeks by subjects who \npresented to the ED with acute asthma.",

We \nexamined the ability of 1 dose of benralizumab, an investigational \nantiinterleukin 5 receptor \u041e\u00b1 monoclonal antibody, to reduce recurrence after \nacute asthma exacerbations.\nMETHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, eligible \nsubjects presented to the ED with an asthma exacerbation, had partial response \nto treatment, and greater than or equal to 1 additional exacerbation within the \nprevious year. Subjects received 1 intravenous infusion of placebo (n = 38) or \nbenralizumab (0.3 mg/kg, n = 36 or 1.0 mg/kg, n = 36) added to outpatient \nmanagement. The primary outcome was the proportion of subjects with greater than \nor equal to 1 exacerbation at 12 weeks in placebo vs the combined benralizumab \ngroups. Secondary outcomes included the time-weighted rate of exacerbations at week \n12, adverse events, blood eosinophil counts, asthma symptom changes, and health \ncare resource utilization.\nRESULTS: The proportion of subjects with greater than or equal to 1 asthma \nexacerbation at 12 weeks was not different between placebo and the combined \nbenralizumab groups (38.9% vs 33.3%; P = .67). The time-weighted rate of \nexacerbations was 3.59 in the placebo group vs 1.82 in the combined benralizumab \ngroups (P = .01). Exacerbations resulting in hospitalization were 1.62 in the \nplacebo group vs 0.65 in the combined benralizumab groups (P = .02). Benralizumab \nreduced blood eosinophil counts but did not affect other outcomes, while \ndemonstrating an acceptable safety profile.\nCONCLUSIONS: Benralizumab was not more effective than placebo on the primary \noutcome in patients who presented to the ED with acute asthma.",

A convenience sample of patients aged 18 to 59 years with acute abdominal, flank, low back, or extremity pain were enrolled. Subjects were consented and randomized to intravenous LDK (0.3mg/kg) or intravenous MOR (0.1mg/kg). Our primary outcome was the maximum change in NRS scores. Secondary outcomes included time to achieve maximum reduction in NRS pain scores, vital signs, adverse events, and provider and nurse satisfaction scores. A sample size of 20 subjects per group was calculated based on an 80% power to detect a 2-point change in NRS scores between treatment groups with estimated SDs of 2 and an \u03b1 of .05, using a repeated-measures linear model.\n\nResults: Forty-five subjects were enrolled (MOR 21, LDK 24). Demographic variables and baseline NRS scores (7.1 vs 7.1) were similar. Ketamine was not superior to MOR in the maximum change of NRS pain scores, MOR=5 (confidence interval, 6.6-3.5) and LDK=4.9 (confidence interval, 5.8-4). The time to achieve maximum reduction in NRS pain scores was at 5 minutes for LDK and 100 minutes for MOR. Vital signs, adverse events, provider, and nurse satisfaction scores were similar between groups.\n\nConclusion: Low-dose ketamine was not more effective on maximum change in NRS pain scores than morphine in patients with acute pain in the emergency department.",

To increase the likelihood that good alignment will be achieved during surgery, smart tools such as robotics or patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) have been introduced.\nQuestions/purposes:\u0412\u00a0We hypothesized that UKA performed with PSI would result in improved level gait as ascertained with three-dimensional analysis, implant positioning, and patient-reported outcomes measured by a validated scoring system when compared with conventional instrumentation 3 months and 1 year after surgery.\nMethods:\u0412\u00a0We randomized 60 patients into two groups using either the PSI technique or a conventional technique. All patients were operated on using the same technique and the same cemented metal-backed implant. Mean age of the patients was 63 \u0412\u00b1 4 years (range, 54-72 years) and mean body mass index was 28 \u0412\u00b1 3 kg/m(2). Patients were evaluated preoperatively, at 3 months, and 1 year after surgery by an independent observer blind to the type of technique. Gait parameters were assessed with three-dimensional analysis during level walking preoperatively and at 1 year, frontal and sagittal position of the implant was evaluated on full-length radiographs at 3 months, and subjective functional outcome and quality of life using routine questionnaires (SF-12, new Knee Society Score [KSS], Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) at 3 months and 1 year. This study had 80% power to detect a 15% difference in walking speed at the p < 0.05 level.\nResults:\u0412\u00a0One year after surgery, there were no differences between the two groups in the analyzed gait spatiotemporal parameters, respectively, for PSI UKA and conventional UKA : double limb support 31% (25%-54%) versus 30% (23%-56%; p = 0.67) and walking speed (1.59 m/s [0.86-1.87 m/s] versus 1.57 m/s [0.71-1.96 m/s]; p = 0.41). No difference was observed between the two groups in terms of lower limb alignment (PSI group 178\u0412\u00b0 \u0412\u00b1 3\u0412\u00b0, conventional group 178\u0412\u00b0 \u0412\u00b1 4\u0412\u00b0; p = 0.24) or implant positioning on mediolateral and anteroposterior radiographs.

        "abstract": "Background: Component alignment can influence implant longevity as well as perhaps pain and function after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), but correct alignment is not consistently achieved. To increase the likelihood that good alignment will be achieved during surgery, smart tools such as robotics or patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) have been introduced.\nQuestions/purposes: We hypothesized that UKA performed with PSI would result in improved level gait as ascertained with three-dimensional analysis, implant positioning, and patient-reported outcomes measured by a validated scoring system when compared with conventional instrumentation 3 months and 1 year after surgery.\nMethods: We randomized 60 patients into two groups using either the PSI technique or a conventional technique. All patients were operated on using the same technique and the same cemented metal-backed implant. Mean age of the patients was 63 \u00b1 4 years (range, 54-72 years) and mean body mass index was 28 \u00b1 3 kg/m(2). Patients were evaluated preoperatively, at 3 months, and 1 year after surgery by an independent observer blind to the type of technique. Gait parameters were assessed with three-dimensional analysis during level walking preoperatively and at 1 year, frontal and sagittal position of the implant was evaluated on full-length radiographs at 3 months, and subjective functional outcome and quality of life using routine questionnaires (SF-12, new Knee Society Score [KSS], Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) at 3 months and 1 year. This study had 80% power to detect a 15% difference in walking speed at the p < 0.05 level.\nResults: One year after surgery, there were no differences between the two groups in the analyzed gait spatiotemporal parameters, respectively, for PSI UKA and conventional UKA: double limb support 31% (25%-54%) versus 30% (23%-56%; p = 0.67) and walking speed (1.59 m/s [0.86-1.87 m/s] versus 1.57 m/s [0.71-1.96 m/s]; p = 0.41).

There is \nno standardised protocol for post-operative rehabilitation available. The \npurpose of this study was to compare two post-operative rehabilitation protocols \nafter open wedge HTO.\nMETHODS: One hundred and twenty consecutive patients with varus malalignment and \nmedial compartment osteoarthritis received an open wedge HTO using an angular \nlocking plate fixation between December 2008 and December 2011. All patients \nwere assigned randomly into one of two groups with different post-operative \nrehabilitation protocols (11-day vs. 6-week 20-kg partial weight-bearing). \nClinical outcome was evaluated using established instruments (Lequesne, Lysholm, \nHSS and IKDC scores) preoperatively, 6, 12 and 18 months post-operatively. \nDeformity analysis was performed preoperatively and during follow-up.\nRESULTS: All clinical scores showed a significant pre- to post-operative \nimprovement. After 6 months, there was a higher improvement in the group of \nearly full weight-bearing. The difference between preoperative and 6-month \nfollow-up for the group with early full weight-bearing and for the group with \n20-kg PWB for 6 weeks was 28 \u00b1 26 and 18 \u00b1 22, respectively, for the Lysholm \nscore and -5.0 \u00b1 5.1 and -3.0 \u00b1 3.6, respectively, for the Lequesne score.\nCONCLUSIONS: The study did not establish a clear primary outcome measure to \ndefinitively determine whether early full weight-bearing was more effective than \n6-week partial weight-bearing in patients with varus malalignment and medial \ncompartment osteoarthritis undergoing open wedge HTO.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Open wedge high tibial osteotomy is a widespread treatment option in \npatients with varus malalignment and medial compartment osteoarthritis. There is \nno standardised protocol for post-operative rehabilitation available. The \npurpose of this study was to compare two post-operative rehabilitation protocols \nand to evaluate the clinical outcome of early full weight-bearing after open \nwedge HTO.\nMETHODS: One hundred and twenty consecutive patients with varus malalignment and \nmedial compartment osteoarthritis received an open wedge HTO using an angular \nlocking plate fixation between December 2008 and December 2011. All patients \nwere assigned randomly into one of two groups with different post-operative \nrehabilitation protocols (11-day vs. 6-week 20-kg partial weight-bearing). \nClinical outcome was evaluated using established instruments (Lequesne, Lysholm, \nHSS and IKDC scores) preoperatively, 6, 12 and 18\u0412\u00a0months post-operatively. \nDeformity analysis was performed preoperatively and during follow-up.\nRESULTS: All clinical scores showed a significant pre- to post-operative \nimprovement. After 6\u0412\u00a0months, there was a higher improvement in the group of \nearly full weight-bearing. The difference between preoperative and 6-month \nfollow-up for the group with early full weight-bearing and for the group with \n20-kg PWB for 6\u0412\u00a0weeks was 28\u0412\u00a0\u0412\u00b1\u0412\u00a026 and 18\u0412\u00a0\u0412\u00b1\u0412\u00a022, respectively, for the Lysholm \nscore and -5.0\u0412\u00a0\u0412\u00b1\u0412\u00a05.1 and -3.0\u0412\u00a0\u0412\u00b1\u0412\u00a03.6, respectively, for the Lequesne score.\nCONCLUSIONS: Early full weight-bearing (11-day 20-kg partial weight-bearing) \nafter open wedge HTO without bone graft leads to earlier improvement of the \nclinical results and can be recommended for post-operative rehabilitation after \nopen wedge HTO and fixation with an angular locking plate.",

A prospective single blinded randomised controlled clinical trial was performed to evaluate 2 types of MB-TKA inserts and 2 types of FB-TKA inserts of the Genesis II prosthesis (Smith & Nephew) in 146 patients with 5-years follow-up. A difference (P=.042) between the MB-TKA inserts was found in KSS function scores. Goniometry, temporal gait parameters and QoL were similar in all groups. Survival was different (P=.047) for FB-TKA with higher revision rate in MB-TKA. The study found differences between insert types in KSS function scores and survival rates, with higher revision rates observed in MB-TKA compared to FB-TKA for the Genesis II implant system.",

        "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: We assess the efficacy and safety of tamsulosin compared with \nplacebo as medical expulsive therapy in patients with distal ureteric stones \nless than or equal to 10 mm in diameter.\nMETHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter \ntrial of adult participants with calculus on computed tomography (CT). Patients \nwere allocated to 0.4 mg of tamsulosin or placebo daily for 28 days. The primary \noutcomes were stone expulsion on CT at 28 days and time to stone expulsion.\nRESULTS: There were 403 patients randomized, 81.4% were men, and the median age \nwas 46 years. The median stone size was 4.0 mm in the tamsulosin group and 3.7 \nmm in the placebo group. Of 316 patients who received CT at 28 days, stone \npassage occurred in 140 of 161 (87.0%) in the tamsulosin group and 127 of 155 \n(81.9%) with placebo, a difference of 5.0% (95% confidence interval -3.0% to \n13.0%). In a prespecified subgroup analysis of large stones (5 to 10 mm), 30 of \n36 (83.3%) tamsulosin participants had stone passage compared with 25 of 41 \n(61.0%) with placebo, a difference of 22.4% (95% confidence interval 3.1% to \n41.6%) and number needed to treat of 4.5. There was no difference in urologic \ninterventions, time to self-reported stone passage, pain, or analgesia \nrequirements. Adverse events were generally mild and did not differ between \ngroups.\nCONCLUSION: We found no benefit overall of 0.4 mg of tamsulosin daily for \npatients with distal ureteric calculi less than or equal to 10 mm in terms of \nspontaneous passage, time to stone passage, pain, or analgesia requirements. In \nthe subgroup with large stones (5 to 10 mm), tamsulosin did increase passage and \nshould be considered.",

While most arthroscopic hip procedures are \nperformed as outpatient surgeries, patients can still experience significant \npostoperative pain and opioid-associated side effects.\nPURPOSE: The potential benefits of a preoperative femoral nerve block (FNB) in \nhip arthroscopy were explored in a previous retrospective review. The study \nobjective was to confirm these findings in a prospective randomized study.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\nMETHODS: Fifty patients undergoing hip arthroscopy were included in this \nprospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial that was patient-, \noperator-, and assessor-blinded. Patients received either a preoperative \nultrasound-guided FNB with 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine (FNB group) or normal \nsaline (control group). Nerve blockade was confirmed via standardized sensory \ntesting before the induction of general anesthesia.

Most patient characteristics were statistically similar \nbetween groups except for operative time, which was longer in the control group. \nCumulative oral morphine consumption was lower in the FNB group at 48 hours; \nthere was no difference at 24 hours or 7 days postoperatively. Pain scores were \nsignificantly lower up to 6 hours postoperatively in the FNB group compared with \ncontrol; however, rebound pain was observed at 24 hours after discharge in \npatients who received FNB. There was no difference in most secondary outcomes. \nImportantly, a total of 6 patients in the FNB group reported falls (without \ninjury) within the first 24 hours postoperatively compared with none in the \ncontrol group. Patient satisfaction with pain control was high in both groups at \nall time points.\nCONCLUSION: Preoperative FNB may improve early pain control after hip \narthroscopy. However, given the observed risk of falls, the routine use of FNB \nfor outpatient hip arthroscopy cannot be recommended.",

        "abstract": "Background: Olecranon bursitis might be a minor problem in the outpatient clinic but relatively be common to occur. However, there are few well-designed studies comparing approaches to treatment.\n\nQuestions/purposes: (1) Which treatment (compression bandaging with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], aspiration, or aspiration with steroid injections) is associated with the highest likelihood of resolution of nonseptic olecranon bursitis? (2) Which treatment is associated with earliest resolution of symptoms? (3) What factors are associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks?\n\nMethods: We enrolled 133 patients from two centers; after applying prespecified exclusions (septic bursitis or concomitant inflammatory arthritis, intraarticular elbow pathology, recent aspiration or steroid injection done elsewhere, and refusal to participate), 90 patients were randomly allocated to receive compression bandaging with NSAIDs (C), aspiration (A), or aspiration with steroid injection (AS) groups (30 patients in each). The groups were similar at baseline in terms of age and gender. Seven patients (four from Group A and three from Group AS) were lost to followup. All patients were followed up weekly for 4 weeks, and the same treatment procedure was repeated if the bursitis recurred with any substantial fluid collection. At 4 weeks, the state of resolution and pain visual analog scale (VAS) were evaluated. Failed resolution was defined as presence of persistent olecranon bursal fluid collection at Week 4 after the initiation of the treatment; on the contrary, if bursal fluid collection was clinically reduced or completely disappeared by the end of Week 4, the treatment was considered successful. We compared the proportion of resolution by Week 4 and the median times to resolution among the treatment groups. In addition, we evaluated whether the resolution affected pain VAS and what factors were associated with the resolution.\n\nResults: There were no differences in the proportion of patients whose bursitis resolved by Week 4 among the three treatment groups (Group C: 25 of 30 [83%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.27-1.72], p = 0.580; Group A: 17 of 26 [65%], relative risk of resolution failure: 2.19 [95% CI, 0.98-4.87], p = 0.083; Group AS: 23 of 27 [85%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.59 [95% CI, 0.22-1.63], p = 0.398) (p = 0.073). Steroid injection after aspiration (Group AS) was associated with the earliest resolution (2.3 weeks [range, 1-4 weeks]) when compared with aspiration alone (Group A; 3.1 weeks [range, 2-4 weeks]) and compression bandaging with NSAIDs (Group C; 3.2 weeks [range, 2-4 weeks]), p = 0.015). Longer duration of symptoms before treatment was the only factor associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks (failed resolution: 6 weeks [range, 2-9 weeks]; successful resolution: 4 weeks [range, 0.4-6 weeks]; p = 0.008).\n\nConclusions: With the numbers available, there were no differences in efficacy when compression bandaging with NSAIDs, aspiration, and aspiration with steroid injection were compared. However, we were powered only to detect a 30% difference, meaning that if there were a smaller difference in efficacy among the groups, we might not have detected it in a study of this size. Our data can be used as pilot data to power future prospective (and likely multicenter) trials. Because olecranon bursitis can recur, and because treatments like aspiration and aspiration with steroid injection can cause complications, unless future trials demonstrate clear efficacy advantages of aspiration and/or injection both at short and longer terms, we suggest that compression bandaging and a short course of NSAIDs may offer the most appropriate balance of safety and efficacy.",

Secondary outcomes included time to resolution, pain visual analog scale (VAS), and factors associated with treatment failure. The groups were similar at baseline in terms of age and gender. Seven patients (four from Group A and three from Group AS) were lost to followup. All patients were followed up weekly for 4 weeks, and the same treatment procedure was repeated if the bursitis recurred with any substantial fluid collection. At 4 weeks, the state of resolution and pain visual analog scale (VAS) were evaluated. Failed resolution was defined as presence of persistent olecranon bursal fluid collection at Week 4 after the initiation of the treatment; on the contrary, if bursal fluid collection was clinically reduced or completely disappeared by the end of Week 4, the treatment was considered successful. We compared the proportion of resolution by Week 4 and the median times to resolution among the treatment groups. In addition, we evaluated whether the resolution affected pain VAS and what factors were associated with the resolution.\n\nResults: There were no differences in the proportion of patients whose bursitis resolved by Week 4 among the three treatment groups (Group C: 25 of 30 [83%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.27-1.72], p = 0.580; Group A: 17 of 26 [65%], relative risk of resolution failure: 2.19 [95% CI, 0.98-4.87], p = 0.083; Group AS: 23 of 27 [85%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.59 [95% CI, 0.22-1.63], p = 0.398) (p = 0.073). Time to resolution was 2.3 weeks (range, 1-4 weeks) for Group AS, 3.1 weeks (range, 2-4 weeks) for Group A, and 3.2 weeks (range, 2-4 weeks) for Group C (p = 0.015). Longer duration of symptoms before treatment was associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks (failed resolution: 6 weeks [range, 2-9 weeks]; successful resolution: 4 weeks [range, 0.4-6 weeks]; p = 0.008).\n\nConclusions: Compression bandaging with NSAIDs was not more effective than aspiration or aspiration with steroid injection in patients with nonseptic olecranon bursitis for the primary outcome of resolution by 4 weeks.",

Our hypothesis was that there would be no differences in joint line angles or correction accuracy between the two groups, that patellar height would increase after CW HTO and decrease after OW HTO, and that leg length and posterior tibial slope would decrease after CW HTO and increase after OW HTO.\n\nMethods: Radiological data were collected from 70 patients participating in an ongoing prospective randomized clinical trial comparing OW and CW HTOs. Digital standing hip-knee-ankle (HKA) radiographs as well as lateral radiographs in 30\u040e of flexion were obtained preoperatively and at 6 months for each patient. Joint line angles, HKA angle, leg length, Insall-Salvati index, Miura-Kawamura index and posterior tibial slope were measured using medical planning software. The complete preoperative radiological examinations of the first 50 patients were used in a study of intra- and inter-rater reliability of the measurements.\n\nResults: The mean posterior slope was reduced by 2.5\u040e in CW HTO, whereas it remained unchanged in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Mean leg length decreased 5.7 mm in CW HTO and increased 3.1 mm in OW HTO (p < 0.001). Changes in joint line angles, patellar height indexes and the correction accuracy showed no significant differences comparing the two techniques. Frontal plane reliability measurement intra- and inter-rater intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) varied from 0.81 to 0.99. Sagittal plane intra- and inter-rater ICC varied from 0.60 to 0.87. Posterior tibial slope intra- and inter-rater ICC showed the lowest values (0.70 and 0.60, respectively) corresponding to a smallest real difference of 4.5\u040e and 5.5\u040e, respectively.\n\nConclusions: Posterior tibial slope and leg length changes were significantly different in CW compared to OW HTOs. We recommend that possible alterations in tibial slope and leg length are considered when the technique of HTO is to be chosen. Landmark-based medical planning software shows good reliability and can be used in preoperative planning and postoperative evaluations of HTOs.",

There were 2 (0.7%) deep incisional SSIs in the control group, and 2 \n(0.7%) organ-space SSIs in the intervention group (P = 1.00). Skin blistering \noccurred in 10 of 283 patients (3.5%) in the intervention group versus 19 of 294 \npatients (6.5%) in the control group (P = .13).\nCONCLUSION: The SPS reapplication was not more effective than single SPS \napplication in reducing overall SSI in patients undergoing elective TJA.",

Pain visual analog scale scores were reported higher in post operative day 1 in the LB group (P = .033).\n\nConclusions: Liposomal bupivacaine was not more effective than standard periarticular injection in opioid-dependent patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.",

Although mobile TKAs may have better short-term results, at medium- and long-term follow-up they do not present important clinical differences compared with fixed-platform TKAs.

Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 1.5, \n3, 6, and 12 months after ACI and was evaluated by the magnetic resonance \nobservation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score and the Knee injury and \nOsteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS).\nRESULTS: MOCART scores showed improvements after 3 months, with slight dose \ndependence, and further improvement after 12 months, although without \nsignificant dose dependence.

At 18 months, a 14% difference in the peak \ntorque of the affected leg favored the surgical group versus the nonsurgical \ngroup (mean peak torque, 110.3 vs 96.5 N\u0412\u00b7m, respectively; mean difference, 13.6 \nN\u0412\u00b7m; 95% CI, 2.0-25.1 N\u0412\u00b7m; P = .022). The RAND 36-Item Health Survey indicated \nbetter results in the domains of physical functioning (P = .006) and bodily pain \n(P = .037) for surgically treated patients.\nCONCLUSION: Surgical and nonsurgical treatments of acute Achilles tendon \nruptures have similar results in terms of the Achilles tendon performance score, \nbut surgery restores calf muscle strength earlier over the entire range of \nmotion of the ankle joint, with a 10% to 18% strength difference favoring \nsurgery at 18 months. Surgery may also result in better health-related quality \nof life in the domains of physical functioning and bodily pain compared with \nnonsurgical treatment.\nREGISTRATION: NCT02012803 (ClinicalTrials.gov).",

There is still a need for a method of anesthesia that can deliver effective long-term postoperative pain relief without incurring the high cost and health burden of opioids and nerve blocks.\n\nQuestions/purposes: (1) Is liposomal bupivacaine-based periarticular injection (PAI) more effective than morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA? (2) Do patients treated with liposomal bupivacaine-based PAI experience fewer opioid-related adverse events compared with patients treated with morphine-based spinal anesthesia or ropivacaine-based PAI in controlling postoperative pain after TKA?\n\nMethods: This multicenter, blind trial randomized 119 patients undergoing TKA with spinal anesthesia to receive spinal anesthesia plus periarticular injection with liposomal bupivacaine (40 patients), spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine plus intrathecal morphine (41 patients) but no liposomal bupivacaine injection, or spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine (38 patients) and no liposomal bupivacaine injection. The two groups that did not receive periarticular liposomal bupivacaine did receive periarticular injection with ropivacaine, and all three groups had ketorolac (30 mg) plus epinephrine (1:1000) in the periarticular injections. Patients in all three groups received identical perioperative multimodal analgesic and antiemetic drugs. All patients were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized and no patients were lost to followup. The primary study endpoints were visual analog score (VAS) for pain and narcotic use during postoperative day 1. Secondary endpoints included side effects associated with narcotic administration during the hospital stay.\n\nResults: Mean VAS pain in the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group was lower than that for the ropivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (1.8 \u00b1 2.1 versus 3.3 \u00b1 2.3, p = 0.005, mean difference: 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-2.5) and 12 hours (1.5 \u00b1 2.0 versus 3.3 \u00b1 2.4, p < 0.001, mean difference: 1.8, 95% CI, 0.8-2.8) after surgery. The morphine spinal group had lower pain compared with the liposomal bupivacaine PAI group at 6 hours (0.9 \u00b1 1.8 versus 1.8 \u00b1 2.1, p = 0.035, mean difference: 1.0, 95% CI, 0.1-1.8), but there was no difference at 12 hours (0.8 \u00b1 1.5 versus 1.5 \u00b1 2.0, p = 0.086, mean difference: 0.7, 95% CI, -0.1 to 1.5). The magnitude of the differences at 6 and 12 hours are near the lower end of minimal clinically important differences reported in the literature, and thus the improvement shown in this study may only represent a small clinical improvement. Both the liposomal bupivacaine group (13% [five of 40]) and the ropivacaine group (5% [two of 38]) had fewer incidents of itching (pruritus) than the spinal morphine group (38% [15 of 41]) (p = 0.001).\n\nConclusions: Liposomal bupivacaine-based periarticular injection was not more effective than morphine-based spinal anesthesia on visual analog score for pain and narcotic use during postoperative day 1 in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.",

All the \nsurgical procedures were performed by the same senior surgeon using the DB \nreconstruction technique. All irradiated hamstring tendon allografts were \nsterilized with 2.5 Mrad of irradiation before distribution and were obtained \nfrom a single certified tissue bank. Graft fixation on the femoral side was by \nan Endobutton, and on the tibial side by a bioabsorbable interference screw \naugmented with a staple. The same rehabilitation protocol was applied to all \npatients. Before surgery and at a mean of 6.9 years of follow-up, patients were \nevaluated by the same observer according to objective and subjective clinical \nevaluations including detailed history, physical examination, radiography, \nfunctional knee ligament testing, KT-2000 arthrometer testing, Harner vertical \njump and Daniel 1-legged hop tests, Lysholm score, Tegner score, International \nKnee Documentation Committee (IKDC) standard evaluation form, and Cincinnati \nknee score.\nRESULTS: A total of 83 patients (Auto: n = 40 [mean age, 29.2 \u00b1 6.9 years]; \nIr-Allo: n = 43 [mean age, 28.6 \u00b1 7.2 years]) fulfilled follow-up and clinical \nevaluations.

All the \nsurgical procedures were performed by the same senior surgeon using the DB \nreconstruction technique. All irradiated hamstring tendon allografts were \nsterilized with 2.5 Mrad of irradiation before distribution and were obtained \nfrom a single certified tissue bank. Graft fixation on the femoral side was by \nan Endobutton, and on the tibial side by a bioabsorbable interference screw \naugmented with a staple. The same rehabilitation protocol was applied to all \npatients. Before surgery and at a mean of 6.9 years of follow-up, patients were \nevaluated by the same observer according to objective and subjective clinical \nevaluations including detailed history, physical examination, radiography, \nfunctional knee ligament testing, KT-2000 arthrometer testing, Harner vertical \njump and Daniel 1-legged hop tests, Lysholm score, Tegner score, International \nKnee Documentation Committee (IKDC) standard evaluation form, and Cincinnati \nknee score.\nRESULTS: A total of 83 patients (Auto: n = 40 [mean age, 29.2 \u0412\u00b1 6.9 years]; \nIr-Allo: n = 43 [mean age, 28.6 \u0412\u00b1 7.2 years]) fulfilled follow-up and clinical \nevaluations. No significant differences were found between the 2 groups \naccording to the overall IKDC functional and subjective evaluations as well as \ntesting of activity levels. Significant between-group differences were found \nwhen comparing the results at final follow-up according to the Lachman test, \nanterior drawer test, pivot-shift test, and KT-2000 arthrometer measurements (P \n< .001). Most importantly, 87.5% of patients in the Auto group and 34.9% in the \nIr-Allo group had a side-to-side difference <3 mm. The rate of laxity \n(side-to-side difference >5 mm) with an irradiated allograft (30.2%) was higher \nthan that with an autograft (7.5%) (P < .001). The failure rate in the Ir-Allo \ngroup (30.2%) was higher than that in the Auto group (7.5%) (P < .001). Anterior \nand rotational stability decreased significantly in the Ir-Allo group; patients \nin the Ir-Allo group also had a shorter operation time. There were 10.0% (4/40) \nof patients in the Auto group and 32.6% (19/43) of patients in the Ir-Allo group \nwho had arthritic progression (P < .05).\nCONCLUSION: There were no significant differences in postoperative activity \nlevels and functional outcomes between the Auto and Ir-Allo groups. However, a \nsignificant increase in anterior and rotational laxity in the Ir-Allo group was \nfound according to evaluations. We do not advocate an irradiated hamstring \ntendon allograft for DB ACLR.",

Patients recorded \ntheir initial level (t0) of vertigo on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) and \nafter 30\u0412\u00a0min (t30) and 60\u0412\u00a0min (t60). The primary outcome parameter was the mean \nchange in VAS score from t0 to t60. Differences between groups and 95% \nconfidence intervals were calculated. Our a priori power calculation estimated \nthat a sample size of 20 patients in each group was required to have an 80% \npower to detect a difference of 20\u0412\u00a0mm between treatment groups.\nRESULTS: There were 20 patients in the diazepam group and 20 in the meclizine \ngroup. The two groups were similar with respect to patient demographics and \npresenting signs and symptoms. At t60, the mean improvements in the diazepam and \nmeclizine groups were 36 and 40, respectively (difference -4; 95% confidence \ninterval -20 to 12; p\u0412\u00a0=\u0412\u00a00.60).\nCONCLUSION: We found no difference between oral diazepam and oral meclizine for \nthe treatment of ED patients with acute peripheral vertigo.",

Preoperative dose, an additional postoperative dose, and 2 postoperative additional doses of TA were infused intravenously in groups A (30 mg/kg), B (15 mg/kg), and C (10 mg/kg), respectively, and TA was not infused in group D. Blood loss (intraoperative, postoperative, and total blood loss), blood transfusion rate and volume, hemoglobin level, and incidence of deep vein thrombosis were analyzed.\n\nResults: The total blood loss and postoperative blood loss were significantly lower in groups B and C compared to group D. There was no significant difference between groups B and C. For intraoperative blood loss, there was no significant difference between groups A and B and between groups B and C. Groups A, B, and C had lower intraoperative blood loss compared to group D.\n\nConclusion: The preoperative dose and an additional dose of TA was not more effective than 2 additional doses of TA in reducing blood loss in patients undergoing TKA.",

The Activity intervention included a 45-minute, 3-day per week supervised training program, while the Diet & Activity intervention included a supplementary 15 minutes of group-based sessions attended by the parents. The intervention lasted 3 months and the participants were followed for another 3 months after the intervention. The participants were assessed for anthropometric measures and activity and fulfilled the modified version of the questionnaire \"Family Eating and Activity Habits Questionnaire\" (FEAHQ).\n\nResults: Both \"Activity\" only and \"Diet & Activity\" groups reduced significantly (p < 0.001) their mean body mass index (BMI) (-1.1, 95% CI -1.3, -0.8, and -1.4, 95% CI -1.7, -1.2, respectively), waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulses per minute, and 50 m sprint run test at 3 months, while greater reductions in BMI were observed at 6 months (-2.3, 95% CI -2.6, -2.0, and -3.1, 95% CI -3.3, -2.8).

The Activity intervention included a 45-minute, 3-day per week supervised training program, while the Diet & Activity intervention included a supplementary 15 minutes of group-based sessions attended by the parents. The intervention lasted 3 months and the participants were followed for another 3 months after the intervention. The primary outcome was body mass index (BMI). The participants were assessed for anthropometric measures and activity and fulfilled the modified version of the questionnaire \"Family Eating and Activity Habits Questionnaire\" (FEAHQ).\n\nResults: Both \"Activity\" only and \"Diet & Activity\" groups reduced their mean body mass index (BMI) (-1.1, 95% CI -1.3, -0.8, and -1.4, 95% CI -1.7, -1.2, respectively) compared to control at 3 months, with greater reductions at 6 months (-2.3, 95% CI -2.6, -2.0, and -3.1, 95% CI -3.3, -2.8). Changes in waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulses per minute, and 50 m sprint run test were observed at 3 months. Changes in the total FEAHQ score were achieved in the \"Diet & Activity\" group both at 3 months and at 6 months.\n\nConclusions: The combined physical activity and nutritional education program was more effective than control in reducing BMI in overweight and obese adolescents.",

A growing body of evidence strongly suggests that the \nprogression from anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury to PTOA is \nmultifactorial, involving the interplay between biomechanical disturbances and \nbiochemical homeostasis of articular cartilage.\nPURPOSE: The purposes of this randomized study using an acute ACL injury model \nwere to (1) evaluate the natural progression of inflammatory and \nchondrodegenerative biomarkers, (2) evaluate the relationship between subjective \nreports of pain and inflammatory and chondrodegenerative biomarkers, and (3) \ndetermine if postinjury arthrocentesis and corticosteroid injection offer the \nability to alter this biochemical cascade.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.\nMETHODS: A total of 49 patients were randomized to 4 groups: group 1 \n(corticosteroid at 4 days after ACL injury, placebo injection of saline at 2 \nweeks), group 2 (placebo at 4 days after ACL injury, corticosteroid at 2 weeks), \ngroup 3 (corticosteroid at both time intervals), or a placebo group (saline \ninjections at both time intervals). Patient-reported outcome measures and \nsynovial biomarkers were collected at approximately 4 days, 11 days, and 5 weeks \nafter injury. The change between the time points was assessed for all variables \nusing Wilcoxon tests, and the relationship between changes in outcome scores and \nbiomarkers were assessed by calculating Spearman \u041f\u0403.

Patient-reported outcomes did not differ between \npatients receiving corticosteroid injections and the placebo group. However, \nincreases in C-telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II), associated with \ncollagen type II breakdown, were significantly greater in the placebo group \n(1.32 \u0412\u00b1 1.10 ng/mL) than in either of the groups that received the \ncorticosteroid injection within the first several days after injury (group 1: \n0.23 \u0412\u00b1 0.27 ng/mL [ P = .01]; group 3: 0.19 \u0412\u00b1 0.34 ng/mL [ P = .01]).\nCONCLUSION: PTOA begins at the time of injury and results early on in dramatic \nmatrix changes in the knee. However, it is encouraging that early intervention \nwith an anti-inflammatory agent was able to affect biomarkers of chondral \ndegeneration. Should early intervention lead to meaningful changes in either the \nonset or severity of symptomatic PTOA, the current treatment paradigm for \npatients with ACL injury may have to be restructured to include early aspiration \nand intra-articular intervention.",

High-flow \nwarm humidified oxygen (HFWHO) is increasingly used, but has not been rigorously \nstudied in randomised trials. We aimed to examine whether HFWHO provided \nenhanced respiratory support, thereby shortening time to weaning off oxygen.\nMETHODS: In this open, phase 4, randomised controlled trial, we recruited \nchildren aged less than 24 months with moderate bronchiolitis attending the \nemergency department of the John Hunter Hospital or the medical unit of the John \nHunter Children's Hospital in New South Wales, Australia. Patients were randomly \nallocated (1:1) via opaque sealed envelopes to HFWHO (maximum flow of 1 L/kg per \nmin to a limit of 20 L/min using 1:1 air-oxygen ratio, resulting in a maximum \nFiO2 of 0\u0412\u00b76) or standard therapy (cold wall oxygen 100% via infant nasal \ncannulae at low flow to a maximum of 2 L/min) using a block size of four and \nstratifying for gestational age at birth. The primary outcome was time from \nrandomisation to last use of oxygen therapy. All randomised children were \nincluded in the primary and secondary safety analyses. This trial is registered \nwith the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number \nACTRN12612000685819.\nFINDINGS: From July 16, 2012, to May 1, 2015, we randomly assigned 202 children \nto either HFWHO (101 children) or standard therapy (101 children). Median time \nto weaning was 24 h (95% CI 18-28) for standard therapy and 20 h (95% CI 17-34) \nfor HFWHO (hazard ratio [HR] for difference in survival distributions 0\u0412\u00b79 [95% \nCI 0\u0412\u00b77-1\u0412\u00b72]; log rank p=0\u0412\u00b761). Fewer children experienced treatment failure on \nHFWHO (14 [14%]) compared with standard therapy (33 [33%]; p=0\u0412\u00b70016); of these \nchildren, those on HFWHO were supported for longer than were those on standard \ntherapy before treatment failure (HR 0\u0412\u00b73; 95% CI 0\u0412\u00b72-0\u0412\u00b76; p<0\u0412\u00b70001). 20 (61%) of \n33 children who experienced treatment failure on standard therapy were rescued \nwith HFWHO. 12 (12%) of children on standard therapy required transfer to the \nintensive care unit compared with 14 (14%) of those on HFWHO (difference -1%; \n95% CI -7 to 16; p=0\u0412\u00b741). Four adverse events occurred (oxygen desaturation and \ncondensation inhalation in the HFWHO group, and two incidences of oxygen tubing \ndisconnection in the standard therapy group); none resulted in withdrawal from \nthe trial. No oxygen-related serious adverse events occurred. Secondary \neffectiveness outcomes are reported in the Results section.\nINTERPRETATION: HFWHO did not significantly reduce time on oxygen compared with \nstandard therapy, suggesting that early use of HFWHO does not modify the \nunderlying disease process in moderately severe bronchiolitis. HFWHO might have \na role as a rescue therapy to reduce the proportion of children requiring \nhigh-cost intensive care.",

Biological analysis of PRP has demonstrated an anti-inflammatory effect on the intra-articular environment.\n\nPurpose: To compare the clinical and biological effects of an intra-articular injection of PRP with those of an intra-articular injection of HA in patients with mild to moderate knee OA.\n\nStudy design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.\n\nMethods: A total of 111 patients with symptomatic unilateral knee OA received a series of either leukocyte-poor PRP or HA injections under ultrasound guidance. Clinical data were collected before treatment and at 4 time points across a 1-year period. Synovial fluid was also collected for analysis of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers before treatment and at 12 and 24 weeks after treatment. Several measures were used to assess results: (1) Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale; (2) International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee evaluation, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, and Lysholm knee score; and (3) difference in intra-articular biochemical marker concentrations.\n\nResults: There were 49 patients randomized to treatment with PRP and 50 randomized to treatment with HA. No difference was seen between the groups in the primary outcome measure (WOMAC pain score). In the secondary outcome measure, linear contrasts identified a significantly higher IKDC score in the PRP group compared with the HA group at 24 weeks (mean \u00b1 standard error [SE], 65.5 \u00b1 3.6 vs 55.8 \u00b1 3.8, respectively; P = .013) and at final follow-up (52 weeks) (57.6 \u00b1 3.37 vs 46.6 \u00b1 3.76, respectively; P = .003). Linear contrasts also identified a statistically lower VAS score in the PRP group versus the HA group at 24 weeks (mean \u00b1 SE, 34.6 \u00b1 3.24 vs 48.6 \u00b1 3.7, respectively; P = .0096) and 52 weeks (44 \u00b1 4.6 vs 57.3 \u00b1 3.8, respectively; P = .0039). An examination of fixed effects showed that patients with mild OA and a lower body mass index had a statistically significant improvement in outcomes. In the biochemical analysis, differences between groups approached significance for interleukin-1_ (mean \u00b1 SE, 0.14 \u00b1 0.05 pg/mL [PRP] vs 0.34 \u00b1 0.16 pg/mL [HA]; P = .06) and tumor necrosis factor _ (0.08 \u00b1 0.01 pg/mL [PRP] vs 0.2 \u00b1 0.18 pg/mL [HA]; P = .068) at 12-week follow-up.\n\nConclusion: We found no difference between HA and PRP at any time point in the primary outcome measure: the patient-reported WOMAC pain score. Significant improvements were seen in other patient-reported outcome measures, with results favoring PRP over HA. Preceding a significant difference in subjective outcomes favoring PRP, there was a trend toward a decrease in 2 proinflammatory cytokines, which suggest that the anti-inflammatory properties of PRP may contribute to an improvement of symptoms.",

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) seems to achieve equal weight loss as laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), but there is still much debate about the quality of life (QOL) after LSG, mainly concerning the association with gastroesophageal reflux. Our hypothesis is that QOL after LSG is comparable with QOL after LRYGB.\n\nMaterials and methods: Between February 2013 and February 2014, 150 patients were randomized to undergo either LSG or LRYGB in our clinic. Differences in QOL were compared between groups by using multiple QOL questionnaires at follow-up moments preoperatively and 2 and 12 months after surgery.\n\nResults: After 12 months of follow-up, 128 patients had returned the questionnaires. Most QOL questionnaires showed significant improvement in scores between the preoperative moment and after 12 months of follow-up. The Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Questionnaire (GerdQ) score deteriorated in the LSG group after 2 months, but recovered again after 12 months. After 2 months of follow-up, the mean GerdQ score was 6.95 \u00b1 2.14 in the LSG group versus 5.50 \u00b1 1.49 in the LRYGB group (p < 0.001).

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Emergency department visits for skin infections in the United States \nhave increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus \n(MRSA). For cellulitis without purulent drainage, \u041e\u0406-hemolytic streptococci are \npresumed to be the predominant pathogens. It is unknown if antimicrobial \nregimens possessing in vitro MRSA activity provide improved outcomes compared \nwith treatments lacking MRSA activity.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine whether cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole \nyields a higher clinical cure rate of uncomplicated cellulitis than cephalexin \nalone.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized \nsuperiority trial in 5 US emergency departments among outpatients older than 12 \nyears with cellulitis and no wound, purulent drainage, or abscess enrolled from \nApril 2009 through June 2012. All participants had soft tissue ultrasound \nperformed at the time of enrollment to exclude abscess. Final follow-up was \nAugust 2012.\nINTERVENTIONS: Cephalexin, 500 mg 4 times daily, plus \ntrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily, for 7 days (n\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030248 \nparticipants) or cephalexin plus placebo for 7 days (n\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030248 participants).\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome determined a priori in the \nper-protocol group was clinical cure, defined as absence of these clinical \nfailure criteria at follow-up visits: fever; increase in erythema (>25%), \nswelling, or tenderness (days 3-4); no decrease in erythema, swelling, or \ntenderness (days 8-10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness \n(days 14-21). A clinically significant difference was defined as greater than \n10%.\nRESULTS: Among 500 randomized participants, 496 (99%) were included in the \nmodified intention-to-treat analysis and 411 (82.2%) in the per-protocol \nanalysis (median age, 40 years [range, 15-78 years]; 58.4% male; 10.9% had \ndiabetes). Median length and width of erythema were 13.0 cm and 10.0 cm. In the \nper-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 182 (83.5%) of 218 \nparticipants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 165 \n(85.5%) of 193 in the cephalexin group (difference, -2.0%; 95% CI, -9.7% to \n5.7%; P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030.50). In the modified intention-to-treat population, clinical cure \noccurred in 189 (76.2%) of 248 participants in the cephalexin plus \ntrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 171 (69.0%) of 248 in the cephalexin \ngroup (difference, 7.3%; 95% CI, -1.0% to 15.5%; P\u0432\u0402\u2030=\u0432\u0402\u2030.07). Between-group adverse \nevent rates and secondary outcomes through 7 to 9 weeks, including overnight \nhospitalization, recurrent skin infections, and similar infection in household \ncontacts, did not differ significantly.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with uncomplicated cellulitis, the use \nof cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared to cephalexin alone \ndid not result in higher rates of clinical resolution of cellulitis in the \nper-protocol analysis. However, because imprecision around the findings in the \nmodified intention-to-treat analysis included a clinically important difference \nfavoring cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, further research may be \nneeded.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Emergency department visits for skin infections in the United States \nhave increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus \n(MRSA). For cellulitis without purulent drainage, \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci are \npresumed to be the predominant pathogens. It is unknown if antimicrobial \nregimens possessing in vitro MRSA activity provide improved outcomes compared \nwith treatments lacking MRSA activity.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine whether cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole \nyields a higher clinical cure rate of uncomplicated cellulitis than cephalexin \nalone.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized \nsuperiority trial in 5 US emergency departments among outpatients older than 12 \nyears with cellulitis and no wound, purulent drainage, or abscess enrolled from \nApril 2009 through June 2012. All participants had soft tissue ultrasound \nperformed at the time of enrollment to exclude abscess. Final follow-up was \nAugust 2012.\nINTERVENTIONS: Cephalexin, 500 mg 4 times daily, plus \ntrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily, for 7 days (n = 248 \nparticipants) or cephalexin plus placebo for 7 days (n = 248 participants).\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome determined a priori in the \nper-protocol group was clinical cure, defined as absence of these clinical \nfailure criteria at follow-up visits: fever; increase in erythema (>25%), \nswelling, or tenderness (days 3-4); no decrease in erythema, swelling, or \ntenderness (days 8-10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness \n(days 14-21). A clinically significant difference was defined as greater than \n10%.\nRESULTS: Among 500 randomized participants, 496 (99%) were included in the \nmodified intention-to-treat analysis and 411 (82.2%) in the per-protocol \nanalysis (median age, 40 years [range, 15-78 years]; 58.4% male; 10.9% had \ndiabetes). Median length and width of erythema were 13.0 cm and 10.0 cm. In the \nper-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 182 (83.5%) of 218 \nparticipants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 165 \n(85.5%) of 193 in the cephalexin group (difference, -2.0%; 95% CI, -9.7% to \n5.7%; P = .50). Between-group adverse event rates and secondary outcomes through \n7 to 9 weeks, including overnight hospitalization, recurrent skin infections, \nand similar infection in household contacts, did not differ significantly.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was not \nmore effective than cephalexin alone in patients with uncomplicated cellulitis.",

We hypothesized that \nthe addition of acetaminophen to a multimodal analgesia regimen would provide \nimproved pain management in patients after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and \nthat the effect of acetaminophen would be variable based on the route of \ndelivery.\nMETHODS: The study was a single-center, randomized, double-blinded, \nplacebo-controlled clinical trial on the efficacy of IV vs oral acetaminophen in \npatients undergoing unilateral TKA. One hundred seventy-four subjects were \nrandomized to one of the 3 groups: IV acetaminophen group (IV group, n = 57) \nreceived 1 g IV acetaminophen and oral placebo before postanesthesia care unit \n(PACU) admission; oral acetaminophen group (PO group, n = 58) received 1 g oral \nacetaminophen and volume-matched IV normal saline; placebo group (Placebo group, \nn = 59) received oral placebo and volume-matched IV normal saline. The primary \noutcome was average PACU pain scores. Secondary outcomes included maximum pain \nscore, pain scores before physical therapy, total opiate consumption, time to \nPACU discharge, time to rescue analgesia, and time to breakthrough pain.\nRESULTS: The average PACU pain score was 0.56 \u00b1 0.99 (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) \nin the IV group compared with 0.67 \u00b1 1.20 in the PO group (P = .84) and 0.58 \u00b1 \n0.99 in the Placebo group (P = .71).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The efficacy of intravenous (IV) acetaminophen compared with its \noral formulation for postoperative analgesia is unknown. We hypothesized that \nthe addition of acetaminophen to a multimodal analgesia regimen would provide \nimproved pain management in patients after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and \nthat the effect of acetaminophen would be variable based on the route of \ndelivery.\nMETHODS: The study was a single-center, randomized, double-blinded, \nplacebo-controlled clinical trial on the efficacy of IV vs oral acetaminophen in \npatients undergoing unilateral TKA. One hundred seventy-four subjects were \nrandomized to one of the 3 groups: IV acetaminophen group (IV group, n\u0412\u00a0= 57) \nreceived 1 g IV acetaminophen and oral placebo before postanesthesia care unit \n(PACU) admission; oral acetaminophen group (PO group, n\u0412\u00a0= 58) received 1 g oral \nacetaminophen and volume-matched IV normal saline; placebo group (Placebo group, \nn\u0412\u00a0= 59) received oral placebo and volume-matched IV normal saline. Pain scores \nwere obtained every 15\u0412\u00a0minutes during PACU stay. Average pain scores, maximum \npain score, and pain scores before physical therapy were compared among the 3 \ngroups. Secondary outcomes included total opiate consumption, time to PACU \ndischarge, time to rescue analgesia, and time to breakthrough pain.\nRESULTS: The average PACU pain score was similar in the IV group (0.56 \u0412\u00b1 0.99 \n[mean \u0412\u00b1 standard deviation]) compared with the PO group (0.67 \u0412\u00b1 1.20; P\u0412\u00a0= .84) \nand Placebo group (0.58 \u0412\u00b1 0.99; P\u0412\u00a0= .71). Total opiate consumption at 6\u0412\u00a0hours \n(0.47 mg hydromorphone equivalents \u0412\u00b1 0.56 vs 0.54 \u0412\u00b1 0.53 vs 0.54 \u0412\u00b1 0.61; P\u0412\u00a0= \n.69) and at 24\u0412\u00a0hours (1.25 \u0412\u00b1 1.30 vs 1.49 \u0412\u00b1 1.34 vs 1.36 \u0412\u00b1 1.31; P\u0412\u00a0= .46) were \nalso similar between the IV, PO, and Placebo groups. No significant differences \nwere found between all groups for any other outcome.\nCONCLUSION: Neither IV nor oral acetaminophen provides additional analgesia in \nthe immediate postoperative period when administered as an adjunct to multimodal \nanalgesia in patients undergoing TKA in the setting of a spinal anesthetic.",

Three hundred \nfifty-five adult, unconscious patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were \nenrolled from February 16, 2013, to June 1, 2016, with final follow-up on \nDecember 27, 2016.\nINTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to TTM (33 \u00b1 1\u00b0C) for 48 hours (n = 176) \nor 24 hours (n = 179), followed by gradual rewarming of 0.5\u00b0C per hour until \nreaching 37\u00b0C.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was 6-month neurologic outcome, \nwith a Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) score of 1 or 2 used to define \nfavorable outcome. Secondary outcomes included 6-month mortality, including time \nto death, the occurrence of adverse events, and intensive care unit resource \nuse.\nRESULTS: In 355 patients who were randomized (mean age, 60 years; 295 [83%] \nmen), 351 (99%) completed the trial. Of these patients, 120/175 (69%) in the \n48-hour group had a favorable outcome at 6 months compared with 112/176 (64%) in \nthe 24-hour group (difference, 4.9%; 95% CI, -5% to 14.8%; relative risk [RR], \n1.08; 95% CI, 0.93-1.25; P = .33). Six-month mortality was 48/175 (27%) in the \n48-hour group and 60/177 (34%) in the 24-hour group (difference, -6.5%; 95% CI, \n-16.1% to 3.1%; RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.59-1.11; P = .19). Time to mortality \nbetween the 48-hour group and the 24-hour group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, \n0.54-1.15; P = .22). Adverse events occurred in 97% of the 48-hour group and 91% \nof the 24-hour group (difference, 5.6%; 95% CI, 0.6%-10.6%; RR, 1.06; 95% CI, \n1.01-1.12; P = .04). The median length of intensive care unit stay was 151 hours \nin the 48-hour group versus 117 hours in the 24-hour group (P < .001), and \nhospital stay was 11 versus 12 days (P = .50).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Targeted temperature management at 33\u00b0C for 48 hours \nwas not more effective on 6-month neurologic outcome than targeted temperature \nmanagement at 33\u00b0C for 24 hours in unconscious survivors from out-of-hospital \ncardiac arrest admitted to the ICU.",

Severe obesity is considered a state of meta-inflammation \nassociated with obesity that influences the development of chronic-degenerative \ndiseases.\nOBJECTIVE: We aimed to establish the immunometabolic differences in bariatric \npatients and to determine whether cellular immunity is associated with metabolic \nchanges.\nMETHODOLOGY: We conducted an observational study in patients who underwent \nlaparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass \n(LRYGB). We explored the differences in the immunometabolic profile before and \nafter surgery in the study group, by surgical technique, and we evaluated the \nchanges in immunological variables as a function of metabolic variables with \ncorrelation analysis.\nRESULTS: The follow-up rate was 88.7%. After the intervention, there were \nchanges in cellular immunity, with a decrease in effector T lymphocytes \n(CD8+CD28-) and an increase in B lymphocytes, memory helper T cells, and \ncytotoxic T lymphocytes. LSG resulted in a greater decrease in (CD4+CD62-)\u0432\u0402\u2030T \nlymphocytes compared with LRYGB. Patients who underwent surgery with LRYGB \npresented greater clinical and metabolic improvements, as well as improvement of \nobesity-associated medical problems. Women who underwent LRYGB showed a greater \nreduction in fat-free mass compared with women who underwent LSG.\nCONCLUSION: Bariatric surgery, mainly LRYGB, leads to immunometabolic changes \nand improves associated medical problems.",
