        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: We hypothesize that limited transthoracic echocardiogram (LTTE) is a \nuseful tool to guide therapy during the initial phase of resuscitation in trauma \npatients.\nMETHODS: All highest-level alert patients with at least one measurement of \nsystolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg, a mean arterial pressure less than \n60 mm Hg, and/or a heart rate greater than 120 beats per minute who arrived to \nthe trauma bay (TB) were randomized to have either LTTE performed (LTTEp) or not \nperformed (non-LTTE) as part of their initial evaluation. Images were stored, \nand results were reported regarding contractility (good vs. poor), fluid status \n(empty inferior vena cava [hypovolemic] vs. full inferior vena cava [not \nhypovolemic]), and pericardial effusion (present vs. absent). Time from TB to \noperating room, intravenous fluid administration, blood product requirement, \nintensive care unit admission, and mortality were examined in both groups.\nRESULTS: A total of 240 patients were randomized. Twenty-five patients were \nexcluded since they died upon arrival to the TB, leaving 215 patients in the \nstudy. Ninety-two patients were in the LTTEp group with 123 patients in the \nnon-LTTE group. The LTTEp and non-LTTE groups were similar in age (38 years vs. \n38.8 years, p = 0.75), Injury Severity Score (ISS) (19.2 vs. 19.0, p = 0.94), \nRevised Trauma Score (RTS) (5.5 vs. 6.0, p = 0.09), lactate (4.2 vs. 3.6, p = \n0.14), and mechanism of injury (p = 0.44). Strikingly, LTTEp had significantly \nless intravenous fluid than non-LTTE patients (1.5 L vs. 2.5 L, p < 0.0001), \nless time from TB to operating room (35.6 minutes vs. 79.1 min, p = 0.0006), \nhigher rate of intensive care unit admission (80.4% vs. 67.2%, p = 0.04), and a \nlower mortality rate (11% vs. 19.5%, p = 0.09). Mortality differences were \nparticularly evident in the traumatic brain injury patients (14.7% in LTTEp vs. \n39.5% in non-LTTE, p = 0.03).\nCONCLUSION: LTTE is a useful guide for therapy in hypotensive trauma patients \nduring the early phase of resuscitation.",

        "Abstract": "Objectives: To compare the maximum change in numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores, in patients receiving low-dose ketamine (LDK) or morphine (MOR) for acute pain in the emergency department.\n\nMethods: We performed an institutional review board-approved, randomized, prospective, double-blinded trial at a tertiary, level 1 trauma center. A convenience sample of patients aged 18 to 59 years with acute abdominal, flank, low back, or extremity pain were enrolled. Subjects were consented and randomized to intravenous LDK (0.3mg/kg) or intravenous MOR (0.1mg/kg). Our primary outcome was the maximum change in NRS scores. A sample size of 20 subjects per group was calculated based on an 80% power to detect a 2-point change in NRS scores between treatment groups with estimated SDs of 2 and an _ of .05, using a repeated-measures linear model.\n\nResults: Forty-five subjects were enrolled (MOR 21, LDK 24). Demographic variables and baseline NRS scores (7.1 vs 7.1) were similar. Ketamine was not superior to MOR in the maximum change of NRS pain scores, MOR=5 (confidence interval, 6.6-3.5) and LDK=4.9 (confidence interval, 5.8-4). The time to achieve maximum reduction in NRS pain scores was at 5 minutes for LDK and 100 minutes for MOR. Vital signs, adverse events, provider, and nurse satisfaction scores were similar between groups.\n\nConclusion: Low-dose ketamine did not produce a greater reduction in NRS pain scores compared with MOR for acute pain in the emergency department. However, LDK induced a significant analgesic effect within 5 minutes and provided a moderate reduction in pain for 2 hours.",
