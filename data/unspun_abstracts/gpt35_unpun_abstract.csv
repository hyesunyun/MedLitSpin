24368354,Findings of a randomized controlled trial using limited transthoracic echocardiogram (LTTE) as a hemodynamic monitoring tool in the trauma bay.,Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery,"RESULTS: Focus on (+) modified treatment population (e.g., report per-protocol rather than intention to treat)",,Emergency Medicine,"BACKGROUND: We hypothesize that limited transthoracic echocardiogram (LTTE) is a 
useful tool to guide therapy during the initial phase of resuscitation in trauma 
patients.
METHODS: All highest-level alert patients with at least one measurement of 
systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg, a mean arterial pressure less than 
60 mm Hg, and/or a heart rate greater than 120 beats per minute who arrived to 
the trauma bay (TB) were randomized to have either LTTE performed (LTTEp) or not 
performed (non-LTTE) as part of their initial evaluation. Images were stored, 
and results were reported regarding contractility (good vs. poor), fluid status 
(empty inferior vena cava [hypovolemic] vs. full inferior vena cava [not 
hypovolemic]), and pericardial effusion (present vs. absent). Time from TB to 
operating room, intravenous fluid administration, blood product requirement, 
intensive care unit admission, and mortality were examined in both groups.
RESULTS: A total of 240 patients were randomized. Twenty-five patients were 
excluded since they died upon arrival to the TB, leaving 215 patients in the 
study. Ninety-two patients were in the LTTEp group with 123 patients in the 
non-LTTE group. The LTTEp and non-LTTE groups were similar in age (38 years vs. 
38.8 years, p = 0.75), Injury Severity Score (ISS) (19.2 vs. 19.0, p = 0.94), 
Revised Trauma Score (RTS) (5.5 vs. 6.0, p = 0.09), lactate (4.2 vs. 3.6, p = 
0.14), and mechanism of injury (p = 0.44). Strikingly, LTTEp had significantly 
less intravenous fluid than non-LTTE patients (1.5 L vs. 2.5 L, p < 0.0001), 
less time from TB to operating room (35.6 minutes vs. 79.1 min, p = 0.0006), 
higher rate of intensive care unit admission (80.4% vs. 67.2%, p = 0.04), and a 
lower mortality rate (11% vs. 19.5%, p = 0.09). Mortality differences were 
particularly evident in the traumatic brain injury patients (14.7% in LTTEp vs. 
39.5% in non-LTTE, p = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: LTTE is a useful guide for therapy in hypotensive trauma patients 
during the early phase of resuscitation.","Abstract: BACKGROUND: Limited transthoracic echocardiogram (LTTE) is proposed as a tool to guide therapy during the initial phase of resuscitation in trauma patients.
METHODS: Highest-level alert trauma patients with specific vital sign criteria were randomized to receive LTTE as part of their initial evaluation or not. Various parameters were assessed, including contractility, fluid status, and pericardial effusion. Outcomes such as time to operating room, fluid administration, blood product requirement, ICU admission, and mortality were compared between the groups.
RESULTS: Of the 240 patients initially randomized, 215 were included in the study. Patients in the LTTE group (n=92) and non-LTTE group (n=123) were similar in baseline characteristics. LTTE patients received less intravenous fluid, had shorter time to the operating room, higher ICU admission rates, and lower mortality rates. Mortality differences were notable in traumatic brain injury patients.
CONCLUSION: LTTE may be a valuable tool for guiding therapy in hypotensive trauma patients during early resuscitation."

25624076,Low-dose ketamine vs morphine for acute pain in the ED: a randomized controlled trial.,The American Journal of Emergency Medicine,"RESULTS: Focus on (+) secondary endpoint, RESULTS: Focus on (+) subgroup analysis",Claim benefit based on (+) secondary endpoint,Emergency Medicine,"Objectives: To compare the maximum change in numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores, in patients receiving low-dose ketamine (LDK) or morphine (MOR) for acute pain in the emergency department.

Methods: We performed an institutional review board-approved, randomized, prospective, double-blinded trial at a tertiary, level 1 trauma center. A convenience sample of patients aged 18 to 59 years with acute abdominal, flank, low back, or extremity pain were enrolled. Subjects were consented and randomized to intravenous LDK (0.3mg/kg) or intravenous MOR (0.1mg/kg). Our primary outcome was the maximum change in NRS scores. A sample size of 20 subjects per group was calculated based on an 80% power to detect a 2-point change in NRS scores between treatment groups with estimated SDs of 2 and an _ of .05, using a repeated-measures linear model.

Results: Forty-five subjects were enrolled (MOR 21, LDK 24). Demographic variables and baseline NRS scores (7.1 vs 7.1) were similar. Ketamine was not superior to MOR in the maximum change of NRS pain scores, MOR=5 (confidence interval, 6.6-3.5) and LDK=4.9 (confidence interval, 5.8-4). The time to achieve maximum reduction in NRS pain scores was at 5 minutes for LDK and 100 minutes for MOR. Vital signs, adverse events, provider, and nurse satisfaction scores were similar between groups.

Conclusion: Low-dose ketamine did not produce a greater reduction in NRS pain scores compared with MOR for acute pain in the emergency department. However, LDK induced a significant analgesic effect within 5 minutes and provided a moderate reduction in pain for 2 hours.","Abstract: Objectives: To compare the maximum change in numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores, in patients receiving low-dose ketamine (LDK) or morphine (MOR) for acute pain in the emergency department.

25909422,"An open, parallel, randomized, comparative, multicenter investigation evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of Mepilex Ag versus silver sulfadiazine in the treatment of deep partial-thickness burn injuries.",Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery,,Claim equivalence/non-inferiority versus control for a (-) endpoint,Emergency Medicine,"BACKGROUND: Partial-thickness burns are among the most frequently encountered 
types of burns, and numerous dressing materials are available for their 
treatment. A multicenter, open, randomized, and parallel study was undertaken to 
determine the efficacy and tolerability of silver sulfadiazine (SSD) compared 
with an absorbent foam silver dressing, Mepilex Ag, on patients aged between 5 
years and 65 years with deep partial-thickness thermal burn injuries (2.5-25% 
total body surface area).
METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to either SSD (n = 82) applied daily or 
a Mepilex Ag dressing (n = 71) applied every 5 days to 7 days. The treatment 
period was up to 4 weeks.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups 
with respect to the primary end point of time to healing, which occurred in 56 
(79%) of 71 patients after a median follow-up time of 15 days in the Mepilex Ag 
group compared with 65 (79%) of 82 patients after a median follow-up time of 16 
days in the SSD group (p = 0.74). There was also no significant difference in 
the percentage of study burn healed. Patients in the Mepilex Ag group had 87.1% 
of their study burn healed (out of the total burn area) compared with 85.2% of 
patients in the SSD group. However, the mean total number of dressings used was 
significantly more in the SSD group (14.0) compared with the Mepilex Ag group 
(3.06, p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in the time until skin 
graft was performed between the two study groups.
CONCLUSION: There was no difference in healing rates between Mepilex Ag and SSD, 
with both products well tolerated. The longer wear time of Mepilex Ag promotes 
undisturbed healing and makes it easier for patients to continue with their 
normal lives sooner.","Abstract: BACKGROUND: Partial-thickness burns are among the most frequently encountered types of burns, and numerous dressing materials are available for their treatment.

26024532,Impact of a clinical decision model for febrile children at risk for serious bacterial infections at the emergency department: a randomized controlled trial.,PLOS ONE,,"Focus on another objective (e.g., trial is (-) but they say they accomplish some goal that they did not prespecify)",Emergency Medicine,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of a clinical decision model for febrile 
children at risk for serious bacterial infections (SBI) attending the emergency 
department (ED).
METHODS: Randomized controlled trial with 439 febrile children, aged 1 month-16 
years, attending the pediatric ED of a Dutch university hospital during 
2010-2012. Febrile children were randomly assigned to the intervention (clinical 
decision model; n = 219) or the control group (usual care; n = 220). The 
clinical decision model included clinical symptoms, vital signs, and C-reactive 
protein and provided high/low-risks for ""pneumonia"" and ""other SBI"". Nurses were 
guided by the intervention to initiate additional tests for high-risk children. 
The clinical decision model was evaluated by 1) 
area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic-curve (AUC) to indicate 
discriminative ability and 2) feasibility, to measure nurses' compliance to 
model recommendations. Primary patient outcome was defined as correct SBI 
diagnoses. Secondary process outcomes were defined as length of stay; diagnostic 
tests; antibiotic treatment; hospital admission; revisits and medical costs.
RESULTS: The decision model had good discriminative ability for both pneumonia 
(n = 33; AUC 0.83 (95% CI 0.75-0.90)) and other SBI (n = 22; AUC 0.81 (95% CI 
0.72-0.90)). Compliance to model recommendations was high (86%). No differences 
in correct SBI determination were observed. Application of the clinical decision 
model resulted in less full-blood-counts (14% vs. 22%, p-value < 0.05) and more 
urine-dipstick testing (71% vs. 61%, p-value < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to our expectations no substantial impact on patient 
outcome was perceived. The clinical decision model preserved, however, good 
discriminatory ability to detect SBI, achieved good compliance among nurses and 
resulted in a more standardized diagnostic approach towards febrile children, 
with less full blood-counts and more rightfully urine-dipstick testing.","Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of a clinical decision model for febrile children at risk for serious bacterial infections (SBI) attending the emergency department (ED).
