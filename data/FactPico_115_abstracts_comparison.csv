BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of common cardiovascular risk 
factors that includes hypertension and insulin resistance. Hypertension and 
diabetes mellitus are frequent comorbidities and, like metabolic syndrome, 
increase the risk of cardiovascular events. Telmisartan, an antihypertensive 
agent with evidence of partial peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 
activity-gamma (PPARgamma) activity, may improve insulin sensitivity and lipid 
profile in patients with metabolic syndrome.
METHODS: In a double-blind, parallel-group, randomized study, patients with 
World Health Organization criteria for metabolic syndrome received once-daily 
doses of telmisartan (80 mg, n = 20) or losartan (50 mg, n = 20) for 3 months. 
At baseline and end of treatment, fasting and postprandial plasma glucose, 
insulin sensitivity, glycosylated haemoglobin (HBA1c) and 24-hour mean systolic 
and diastolic blood pressures were determined.
RESULTS: Telmisartan, but not losartan, significantly (p < 0.05) reduced free 
plasma glucose, free plasma insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin 
resistance and HbAic. Following treatment, plasma glucose and insulin were 
reduced during the oral glucose tolerance test by telmisartan, but not by 
losartan. Telmisartan also significantly reduced 24-hour mean systolic blood 
pressure (p < 0.05) and diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.05) compared with 
losartan.
CONCLUSION: As well as providing superior 24-hour blood pressure control, 
telmisartan, unlike losartan, displayed insulin-sensitizing activity, which may 
be explained by its partial PPARgamma activity.

Thalassemia is the commonest single gene disorder in India. About 10,000 infants 
with Thalassemia major are born every year. The present study was under taken 
with a hope to prevail better quality of life to the Thalassemic patients. 
Pallor being the chief complaint, a randomized controlled trial was undertaken 
with Dhatri Avaleha as it is specially mentioned for Pandu, Kamala & Haleemaka 
Roga. Children between age group of 1 to 15 years were randomly divided in two 
groups: Drug treated group (Group A) and Control group (Group B). Assessment was 
done on subjective and objective parameters after 30 and 60 days of treatment 
with follow up of two month. Statistically significant (P<0.01) result was 
obtained in Blood transfusion interval in group 'A' in comparison to group 'B'. 
Dhatri Avaleha may have a potential to increase blood transfusion interval and 
decrease secondary infection and thus it can be used as supportive therapy with 
modern medical management.

BACKGROUND: Nasal insufflation of CO2 has been shown to exert antinociceptive 
respectively antihyperalgesic effects in animal pain models using topical 
capsaicin with activation of TRPV1-receptor positive nociceptive neurons. 
Clinical benefit from CO2 inhalation in patients with craniofacial pain caused 
by a putative activation of TRPV1 receptor positive trigeminal neurons has also 
been reported. These effects are probably mediated via an activation of TRPV1 
receptor - positive neurons in the nasal mucosa with subsequent central 
inhibitory effects (such as conditioned pain modulation). In this study, we 
aimed to examine the effects of intranasal CO2 on a human model of craniofacial 
pain elicited by nasal application of capsaicin.
METHODS: In a first experiment, 48 healthy volunteers without previous 
craniofacial pain received intranasal capsaicin to provoke trigeminal pain 
elicited by activation of TRVP1 positive nociceptive neurons. Then, CO2 or air 
was insufflated alternatingly into the nasal cavity at a flow rate of 1 l/min 
for 60 sec each. In the subsequent experiment, all participants were randomized 
into 2 groups of 24 each and received either continuous nasal insufflation of 
CO2 or placebo for 18:40 min after nociceptive stimulation with intranasal 
capsaicin. In both experiments, pain was rated on a numerical rating scale every 
60 sec.
RESULTS: Contrary to previous animal studies, the effects of CO2 on experimental 
trigeminal pain were only marginal. In the first experiment, CO2 reduced pain 
ratings only minimally by 5.3% compared to air if given alternatingly with 
significant results for the main factor GROUP (F1,47=4.438; p=0.041) and the 
interaction term TIME*GROUP (F2.6,121.2=3.3; p=0.029) in the repeated-measures 
ANOVA. However, these effects were abrogated after continuous insufflation of 
CO2 or placebo with no significant changes for the main factors or the 
interaction term.
CONCLUSIONS: Although mild modulatory effects of low-flow intranasal CO2 could 
be seen in this human model of TRPV-1 mediated activation of nociceptive 
trigeminal neurons, utility is limited as observed changes in pain ratings are 
clinically non-significant.

OBJECTIVE: There are controversial findings in the literature on the effects of 
chest physiotherapy on postextubation lung collapse in pediatric age group. 
Therefore, we aimed to investigate the efficacy of chest physiotherapy in 
prevention of postextubation atelectasis in pediatric patients.
MATERIALS & METHODS: In a case-control study from March 2007 to March 2011, two 
groups of patients (35 patients in each group) susceptible to lung collapse were 
enrolled in the study. The studied patients had neuromuscular diseases such as 
spinal muscular atrophy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, critical illness 
polyneuropathy/myopathy, and cerebral palsy. The patients were randomly divided 
into two groups (case and control); The case group underwent daily chest 
physiotherapy through vibrator and chest percussion and the control group was 
under supervision. In the latter group, the underlying disease was treated and 
the lung collapse was managed, if occurred.
RESULTS: The frequency of atelectasis was lower in the case group who received 
prophylactic chest physiotherapy compared to the control group (16.6% vs. 40%).
CONCLUSION: Chest physiotherapy as well as appropriate and regular change of 
position can considerably reduce the rate of pulmonary collapse in pediatric 
patients.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the analgesic effect, efficacy and safety of aceclofenac 
controlled release (CR) in patients with chronic knee osteoarthritis (OA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 125 subjects with chronic knee OA were 
randomly divided into two groups: one group (n=62) was administered aceclofenac 
CR once daily and the other (n=63), aceclofenac immediate release (IR) twice a 
day for 4 weeks. A 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS), Knee injury and 
Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and range of motoin (ROM) were evaluated as 
the outcome measures. To evaluate the safety of the drug, adverse events, vital 
signs, physical examination findings, clinical laboratory values and 
electrocardiographic findings were evaluated.
RESULTS: The VAS, KOOS and ROM were improved after 4 weeks of administration in 
both groups, but the differences between the two groups were not statistically 
significant. Significant differences between the two groups were not shown in 
the evaluation of the adverse events, vital sign, physical examination results, 
clinical laboratory values, and electrocardiography.
CONCLUSIONS: The aceclofenac CR and aceclofenac IR were equally effective in 
patients with chronic knee OA and the clinical trial results didn't show any 
significant difference in safety. The new aceclofenac CR formulation was found 
to be effective and safe with the practical advantage of once daily 
administration.

PURPOSE: A link between poor sleep quality and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has 
recently been suggested. Since endogenous melatonin levels are already reduced 
at preclinical AD stages, it is important to ask whether replenishing the 
missing hormone would be beneficial in AD and whether any such effects would be 
related to the presence of sleep disorder in patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The effects of add-on prolonged-release melatonin (PRM) (2 
mg) to standard therapy on cognitive functioning and sleep were investigated in 
80 patients (men [50.7%], women [49.3%], average age 75.3 years [range, 52-85 
years]) diagnosed with mild to moderate AD, with and without insomnia 
comorbidity, and receiving standard therapy (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors 
with or without memantine). In this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group 
study, patients were treated for 2 weeks with placebo and then randomized (1:1) 
to receive 2 mg of PRM or placebo nightly for 24 weeks, followed by 2 weeks 
placebo. The AD Assessment Scale-Cognition (ADAS-Cog), Instrumental Activities 
of Daily Living (IADL), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), sleep, as assessed 
by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and a daily sleep diary, and safety 
parameters were measured.
RESULTS: Patients treated with PRM (24 weeks) had significantly better cognitive 
performance than those treated with placebo, as measured by the IADL (P=0.004) 
and MMSE (P=0.044). Mean ADAS-Cog did not differ between the groups. Sleep 
efficiency, as measured by the PSQI, component 4, was also better with PRM 
(P=0.017). In the comorbid insomnia (PSQI ≥6) subgroup, PRM treatment resulted 
in significant and clinically meaningful effects versus the placebo, in mean 
IADL (P=0.032), MMSE score (+1.5 versus -3 points) (P=0.0177), and sleep 
efficiency (P=0.04). Median ADAS-Cog values (-3.5 versus +3 points) (P=0.045) 
were significantly better with PRM. Differences were more significant at longer 
treatment duration. PRM was well tolerated, with an adverse event profile 
similar to that of placebo.
CONCLUSION: Add-on PRM has positive effects on cognitive functioning and sleep 
maintenance in AD patients compared with placebo, particularly in those with 
insomnia comorbidity. The results suggest a possible causal link between poor 
sleep and cognitive decline.

Comparative evaluation of envelope type of advanced flap with and without type I 
collagen membrane (NEOMEM™) in the treatment of multiple buccal gingival 
recession defects: A clinical study.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to compare and evaluate the clinical 
outcome of the envelope-type of coronally advanced flap (CAF) alone versus 
envelope type of coronally advanced flap plus type I collagen membrane (NEOMEM) 
in the treatment of multiple buccal gingival recessions, using the split mouth 
study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten patients in the age group of 20-50 years showing 
bilateral gingival recessions were treated. The defects in each patient were 
randomly assigned as Group A, which were treated with the envelope type of CAF, 
and those in Group B were treated with envelope type of CAF along with the Type 
I collagen membrane (NEOMEM). The recession depth (RD), probing depth (PD), 
clinical attachment level (CAL), and width of the keratinized tissue (KT) were 
measured at baseline, at three and six month intervals.
RESULTS: Forty-six Miller's class I and II gingival recessions were treated. In 
the CAF + Type I collagen membrane (NEOMEM)-treated (Group B) sites the baseline 
gingival recession was 2.34 ± 0.48 mm, while in the CAFtreated (Group A) sites 
it was 2.52 ± 0.84 mm. Both the treatments resulted in significant recession 
depth reduction (P < 0.001), but the reduction was significantly greater (P < 
0.01) for Group B than Group A. The probing depth changes were significant (P < 
0.01) for both groups, but the difference was nonsignificant. Similarly, a 
significant gain of CAL was seen in Group B (2.23 ± 0.75 mm, P < 0.001) as well 
as in group A (1.60 ± 0.86 mm, P < 0.001) showing a significant difference (P < 
0.01) between the two groups. The width of keratinized tissue was also 
significantly (P < 0.001) increased in both groups, but the increase was 
significantly greater (P < 0.001) in group B (2.30 ± 1.06 mm) than in group A 
(1.21 ± 0.67 mm).
CONCLUSION: The envelope type of CAF along with Type I collagen membrane 
(NEOMEM) was more effective than envelope type of CAF alone, in producing root 
coverage in multiple gingival recession defects, associated with gain in CAL as 
also in the width of KT.

trial. 409 patients with active PsA were randomised 1:1:1 to placebo, CZP 200 mg 
every 2 weeks (Q2W) or CZP 400 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W). The arthritis-specific 
Work Productivity Survey (WPS) assessed the impact of PsA on paid work and 
household productivity, and participation in social activities during the 
preceding month. WPS responses were compared between treatment arms using a 
non-parametric bootstrap-t method.
RESULTS: At baseline, 56.6%, 60.1% and 61.5% of placebo, CZP 200 mg Q2W and CZP 
400 mg Q4W patients were employed. By week 24, employed CZP patients reported an 
average of 1.0-1.8 and 3.0-3.9 fewer days of absenteeism and presenteeism, 
respectively, per month compared with 1.0 and 0.3 fewer days for placebo 
patients (p<0.05). Within the home, by week 24, CZP patients reported an average 
of 3.0-3.5 household work days gained per month versus 1.0 day for placebo 
(p<0.05). CZP patients also reported fewer days with reduced household 
productivity or days lost for participation in family, social and leisure 
activities. Improvements with CZP were seen as early as week 4 and continued to 
week 24.
CONCLUSIONS: CZP treatment significantly improved productivity at paid work and 
within the home, and resulted in greater participation in social activities for 
PsA patients.

Reinforcement signals in the striatum are known to be crucial for mediating the 
subjective rewarding effects of acute drug intake. It is proposed that these 
effects may be more involved in early phases of drug addiction, whereas negative 
reinforcement effects may occur more in later stages of the illness. This study 
used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore whether 
acute heroin substitution also induced positive reinforcement effects in 
striatal brain regions of protracted heroin-maintained patients. Using 
independent component analysis and a dual regression approach, we compared 
resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) strengths within the basal 
ganglia/limbic network across a group of heroin-dependent patients receiving 
both an acute infusion of heroin and placebo and 20 healthy subjects who 
received placebo only. Subsequent correlation analyses were performed to test 
whether the rsFC strength under heroin exposure correlated with the subjective 
rewarding effect and with plasma concentrations of heroin and its main 
metabolites morphine. Relative to the placebo treatment in patients, heroin 
significantly increased rsFC of the left putamen within the basal ganglia/limbic 
network, the extent of which correlated positively with patients' feelings of 
rush and with the plasma level of morphine. Furthermore, healthy controls 
revealed increased rsFC of the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus in this 
network relative to the placebo treatment in patients. Our results indicate that 
acute heroin substitution induces a subjective rewarding effect via increased 
striatal connectivity in heroin-dependent patients, suggesting that positive 
reinforcement effects in the striatum still occur after protracted maintenance 
therapy.

PURPOSE: To prospectively compare SIRT and DEB-TACE for treating hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC).
METHODS: From 04/2010-07/2012, 24 patients with histologically proven 
unresectable N0, M0 HCCs were randomized 1:1 to receive SIRT or DEB-TACE. SIRT 
could be repeated once in case of recurrence; while, TACE was repeated every 6 
weeks until no viable tumor tissue was detected by MRI or contraindications 
prohibited further treatment. Patients were followed-up by MRI every 3 months; 
the final evaluation was 05/2013.
RESULTS: Both groups were comparable in demographics (SIRT: 8males/4females, 
mean age 72 ± 7 years; TACE: 10males/2females, mean age 71 ± 9 years), initial 
tumor load (1 patient ≥25 % in each group), and BCLC (Barcelona Clinic Liver 
Cancer) stage (SIRT: 12×B; TACE 1×A, 11×B). Median progression-free survival 
(PFS) was 180 days for SIRT versus 216 days for TACE patients (p = 0.6193) with 
a median TTP of 371 days versus 336 days, respectively (p = 0.5764). Median OS 
was 592 days for SIRT versus 788 days for TACE patients (p = 0.9271). Seven 
patients died in each group. Causes of death were liver failure (n = 4 SIRT 
group), tumor progression (n = 4 TACE group), cardiovascular events, and 
inconclusive (n = 1 in each group).
CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences were found in median PFS, OS, and TTP. 
The lower rate of tumor progression in the SIRT group was nullified by a greater 
incidence of liver failure. This pilot study is the first prospective randomized 
trial comparing SIRT and TACE for treating HCC, and results can be used for 
sample size calculations of future studies.

OBJECTIVES: Neck pain in chronic whiplash syndrome is a major burden for 
patients, healthcare providers and insurance companies. Randomized data on 
treatment of botulinum toxin in chronic whiplash syndrome are scarce. We 
conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to prove efficacy of 
botulinum toxin for neck pain in chronic whiplash syndrome.
METHODS: 40 patients with chronic whiplash syndrome (whiplash associated 
disorders grade 1 and 2) were randomly assigned to receive botulinum toxin 
(maximum 100 units) or placebo (saline) in muscles with increased tenderness.
RESULTS: After 12 weeks there was no significant difference between the two 
treatment groups in decrease of neck pain intensity on VAS (-7.0 mm, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) [-20.7 to +6.7]), mean number of neck pain days (-1%; 
95% CI [-15% to +13%]), neck pain hours per day (-0.14; 95% CI [-3.0 to +2.7]), 
days on which symptomatic treatment was taken (-0.7%; 95% CI [-15% to +13%]) 
number of analgesics taken per day (-0.14; 95% CI [-0.6 to +0.4]) and total 
cervical range of motion (-11 degrees; 95% CI [-40 to +17]). There also was no 
significant difference in patient's assessment of improvement after week 4, 8 
and 12.
CONCLUSIONS: Botulinum toxin was not proven effective in treatment of neck pain 
in chronic whiplash syndrome. Increased muscle tenderness alone might not be the 
major cause of neck pain in whiplash syndrome.

BACKGROUND: Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) causes hydronephrosis and 
progressive renal impairment may ensue if left uncorrected. Open pyeloplasty 
remains the standard against which new technique must be compared. We compared 
laparoscopic (LP) and open pyeloplasty (OP) in a randomized prospective trial.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective randomized study was done from January 2004 
to January 2007 in which a total of 28 laparoscopic and 34 open pyeloplasty were 
done. All laparoscopic pyeloplasties were performed transperitoneally. Standard 
open Anderson Hynes pyeloplasty, spiral flap or VY plasty was done depending on 
anatomic consideration. Patients were followed with DTPA scan at three months 
and IVP at six months. Perioperative parameters including operative time, 
analgesic use, hospital stay, and complication and success rates were compared.
RESULTS: Mean total operative time with stent placement in LP group was 244.2 
min (188-300 min) compared to 122 min (100-140 min) in OP group. Compared to OP 
group, the post operative diclofenac requirement was significantly less in LP 
group (mean 107.14 mg) and OP group required mean of (682.35 mg). The duration 
of analgesic requirement was also significantly less in LP group. The 
postoperative hospital stay in LP was mean 3.14 Days (2-7 days) significantly 
less than the open group mean of 8.29 days (7-11 days).
CONCLUSION: LP has a minimal level of morbidity and short hospital stay compared 
to open approach. Although, laparoscopic pyeloplasty has the disadvantages of 
longer operative time and requires significant skill of intracorporeal knotting 
but it is here to stay and represents an emerging standard of care.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of flapless implant surgery on 
soft-tissue profile and to compare the clinical outcomes of flapless implant 
therapy on immediate loading (IL) implants to delayed loading (DL) implants.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study sample consisted of 20 patients who were 
partially edentulous in the anterior maxillary region. They were divided into 
two groups. In group I (IL) 10 implants were placed and immediately 
provisionalized and restored with a metal ceramic crown on the 14th day. In 
group II (DL) 10 implants were placed and loaded after 4 months. Single-piece 
implants were used for the IL group and two-piece implants were used for the DL 
group. All soft tissue parameters i.e., modified plaque index (mPI), modified 
bleeding index (mBI), papillary index (PPI), marginal level of soft tissue (ML) 
and width of keratinized mucosa (WKM) were recorded at baseline, Day 60, Day 120 
and Day 180.
RESULTS: The success rate in group I was found to be 80%, which was lower than 
the success rate in group II which was found to be 90%. On comparison, there is 
no statistically significant difference in success rate between the two study 
groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups 
over time in parameters like mPI, mBI, ML and WKM. The mean PPI score in group 
II showed a significant increase from when compared to group I.

OBJECTIVES: Using the fluid filtration method, an in vitro study was conducted 
to evaluate the effects of medication with calcium hydroxide on the sealing 
ability of the New Endodontic Cement (NEC) apical barrier in the short and long 
terms.
METHODS: Fifty extracted single rooted teeth were prepared and apical resorption 
produced using acid sulfuric for four days. The teeth were randomly divided into 
two experimental groups (n=20) and two control groups. In group 1, calcium 
hydroxide was placed into all canals for one week and in group 2, no medication 
was used. In both groups, a 4 mm NEC apical plug was placed in the canals and 
the remaining portion of the canals was filled with gutta-percha. The amount of 
microleakage of all samples was evaluated after one week and three months. The 
data were statistically analyzed using two-way ANOVA.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the two groups in either 
time period (P>.05). In both group 1 and group 2, microleakage increased after 
three months but this increase was not statistically significant (P>.05).
CONCLUSIONS: According to the result of this study, medication with calcium 
hydroxide had no adverse effect on the short- and long-term sealing properties 
of an NEC apical plug.

BACKGROUND: Amygdala hemodynamic responses to positive stimuli are attenuated in 
major depressive disorder (MDD), and normalize with remission. Real-time 
functional MRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) offers a non-invasive method to 
modulate this regional activity. We examined whether depressed participants can 
use rtfMRI-nf to enhance amygdala responses to positive autobiographical 
memories, and whether this ability alters symptom severity.
METHODS: Unmedicated MDD subjects were assigned to receive rtfMRI-nf from either 
left amygdala (LA; experimental group, n = 14) or the horizontal segment of the 
intraparietal sulcus (HIPS; control group, n = 7) and instructed to contemplate 
happy autobiographical memories (AMs) to raise the level of a bar representing 
the hemodynamic signal from the target region to a target level. This 40s Happy 
condition alternated with 40s blocks of rest and counting backwards. A final 
Transfer run without neurofeedback information was included.
RESULTS: Participants in the experimental group upregulated their amygdala 
responses during positive AM recall. Significant pre-post scan decreases in 
anxiety ratings and increases in happiness ratings were evident in the 
experimental versus control group. A whole brain analysis showed that during the 
transfer run, participants in the experimental group had increased activity 
compared to the control group in left superior temporal gyrus and temporal polar 
cortex, and right thalamus.
CONCLUSIONS: Using rtfMRI-nf from the left amygdala during recall of positive 
AMs, depressed subjects were able to self-regulate their amygdala response, 
resulting in improved mood. Results from this proof-of-concept study suggest

Amygdala hemodynamic responses to positive stimuli are attenuated in major depressive disorder (MDD), and normalize with remission. Real-time functional MRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) offers a non-invasive method to modulate this regional activity. We examined whether depressed participants can use rtfMRI-nf to enhance amygdala responses to positive autobiographical memories, and whether this ability alters symptom severity.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
Unmedicated MDD subjects were assigned to receive rtfMRI-nf from either left amygdala (LA; experimental group, n = 14) or the horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus (HIPS; control group, n = 7) and instructed to contemplate happy autobiographical memories (AMs) to raise the level of a bar representing the hemodynamic signal from the target region to a target level. This 40s Happy condition alternated with 40s blocks of rest and counting backwards. A final Transfer run without neurofeedback information was included.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
Participants in the experimental group upregulated their amygdala responses during positive AM recall. Significant pre-post scan decreases in anxiety ratings and increases in happiness ratings were evident in the experimental versus control group. A whole brain analysis showed that during the transfer run, participants in the experimental group had increased activity compared to the control group in left superior temporal gyrus and temporal polar cortex, and right thalamus.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
Using rtfMRI-nf from the left amygdala during recall of positive AMs, depressed subjects were able to self-regulate their amygdala response, resulting in improved mood. Results from this proof-of-concept study suggest that rtfMRI-nf training with positive AM recall holds potential as a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of depression.",TRUE,

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is one of the most common causes of cardiovascular 
disease as it causes arterial stiffness changes. The purpose of this study is to 
characterize, in vivo, carotid arterial structural and functional changes by 
applying radio frequency and X-strain ultrasound techniques.
METHODS: Ninety-one subjects were assigned into two groups; a diabetes group and 
a control group. Structural and functional changes in the common carotid 
arterial wall were investigated by quality intima-media thickness (QIMT), 
quality arterial stiffness (QAS), and X-strain analysis with a Mylab Twice 
ultrasound instrument. The relationships among variables between the two groups 
were analyzed in this study.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in carotid IMT (626.5 ± 169.1 μm 
vs. 568.5 ± 122.6 μm, P = 0.1506) between two groups. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) 
and stiffness index (β) were remarkably greater (8.388 ± 3.254 m/s vs. 
7.269 ± 1.332 m/s; 12.51 ± 14.16 vs.9.279 ± 2.871), while compliance coefficient 
(CC) decreased significantly in the diabetes group (0.802 ± 0.3094 mm2/Kpa vs. 
0.968 ± 0.3992 mm2/Kpa) (P < 0.05). The displacement difference of radial 
(RD-D), longitudinal (LD-D) and rotation (ROT-D) directions were significantly 
different between two groups' comparison (P = 0.0212, P = 0.0235 and P = 0.0072, 
respectively). The time of circumferential peak strain difference (CS-DT) and 
the time of radial peak strain rate (RSR-T) were found to be significantly 
different between the two groups (341.9 ± 77.56 ms vs. 369.0 ± 78.26 ms, 
P = 0.0494; 142.7 ± 22.43 ms vs. 136.2 ± 30.70 ms, P = 0.0474). CS-TD and RSR-T 
were also found to be positively correlated with CC value (r = 0.3908, P < 0.005 
and r = 0.3027, P = 0.0326, respectively). Finally, PWV was negatively 
correlated with CC with (r = -0.6177, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In type 2 diabetes, the functional changes in CCA can be identified 
using the methods presented in this article earlier than the structural changes. 
Arterial stiffness values provided by QAS and X-strain analysis can be used as 
indicators of CCA functional lesions in patients with type 2 diabetes.

CONTEXT: Uncertainty exists as to which treatments are most effective for 
bronchiolitis, with considerable practice variation within and across health 
care sites.
OBJECTIVE: A network meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness of common 
treatments for bronchiolitis in children aged ≤2 years.
DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, 
Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, ClinicalTrials.gov, 
and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry 
Platform were searched from inception to September 1, 2019.
STUDY SELECTION: A total 150 randomized controlled trials comparing a placebo or 
active comparator with any bronchodilator, glucocorticoid steroid, hypertonic 
saline solution, antibiotic, helium-oxygen therapy, or high-flow oxygen therapy 
were included.
DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted by 1 reviewer and independently verified. 
Primary outcomes were admission rate on day 1 and by day 7 and hospital length 
of stay. Strength of evidence was assessed by using Confidence in Network 
Meta-Analysis .
RESULTS: Nebulized epinephrine (odds ratio: 0.64, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
0.44 to 0.93, low confidence) and nebulized hypertonic saline plus salbutamol 
(odds ratio: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.84, low confidence) reduced the admission 
rate on day 1. No treatment significantly reduced the admission rate on day 7. 
Nebulized hypertonic saline (mean difference: -0.64 days, 95% CI: -1.01 to 
-0.26, low confidence) and nebulized hypertonic saline plus epinephrine (mean 
difference: -0.91 days, 95% CI: -1.14 to -0.40, low confidence) reduced hospital 
length of stay.
LIMITATIONS: Because we did not report adverse events in this analysis, we 
cannot make inferences about the safety of these treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: Although hypertonic saline alone, or combined with epinephrine, may 
reduce an infant's stay in the hospital, poor strength of evidence necessitates 
additional rigorous trials.

indicated they have no potential conflicts of interest to disclose.","ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND:.
This study investigated the effect of combining oral dexamethasone with either nebulized racemic epinephrine or salbutamol compared to bronchodilators alone for the treatment of infants with bronchiolitis.

ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:.
This was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial on infants (1 to 12 months) who were diagnosed in the emergency department with moderate-to-severe bronchiolitis. The primary outcome was the rate of hospital admission within 7 days of the first dose of treatment, and the secondary outcomes were changes in respiratory distress assessment instrument score, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation (O2 Sat) over a 4-hour observation period. Infants (n = 162) were randomly assigned to four groups: A (dexamethasone + racemic epinephrine) = 45, B (placebo and racemic epinephrine) =39, C (dexamethasone and salbutamol) = 40, or D (placebo and salbutamol) = 38.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.
Patients who had received dexamethasone + epinephrine exhibited similar admission rates compared to placebo + epinephrine or salbutamol (P = 0.64). Similarly, no statistically significant difference was observed in the rate of hospitalization for patients who received dexamethasone + salbutamol compared to those who received placebo + epinephrine or salbutamol (P = 0.51). Clinical parameters were improved at the end of the 4-hour observation period for all treatment groups. Treatment with dexamethasone + epinephrine resulted in a statistically significant change in HR over time (P &lt; 0.005) compared to the other groups.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:.
This study adds to a body of evidence suggesting that corticosteroids have no role in the management of bronchiolitis for young infants who are first time wheezers with no risk of atopy.",FALSE,24982826

The present study was conducted to determine the best level of substitution of 
soybean meal by sunflower cake in diets for kids through the evaluation of 
quantitative carcass traits. Thirty-two Boer kids X 1/2 NDB (no defined breed), 
males, non-castrated, with 4 months of age and initial body weight of 15±3.2 kg, 
were randomly assigned to individual pens. The treatments contained four 
substitution levels of soybean meal by sunflower cake (0, 33, 66 and 100% DM). 
At the end of the experimental period, the animals were slaughtered. There was 
no influence of the treatments on any of the mean values of the evaluated 
measures (p>0.05): 21.78 kg (body weight at slaughter), 8.65 kg (hot carcass 
weight), 8.59 kg (cold carcass weight), 40.27% (hot carcass yield), 39.20% (cold 
carcass yield), 7.73 cm(2)(rib eye area), 46.74 cm (carcass outer length), 45.68 
cm (carcass internal length), 36.92 cm (leg length), 26.04 cm (leg perimeter), 
48.66 cm (hind perimeter), 58.62 cm (thoracic perimeter), 0.20 (carcass 
compactness index), 68.48% (total muscle of the leg), 2.79% (total leg fat), 
55.19% (subcutaneous leg fat), 28.82% (total bone), 81.66 g (femur weight), 
14.88 cm (femur length), 0.38 (leg muscularity index), 2.53 (muscle:bone ratio) 
and 33.42 (muscle:fat ratio). The substitution of soybean meal by sunflower cake 
may be recommended up to a level of 100% without alterations to quantitative 
carcass traits.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of aquatic and land-based physiotherapy in 
reducing musculoskeletal hip and lower back pain and increasing overall physical 
capabilities of sickle cell disease patients.
METHODS: Informed written consent was obtained from all volunteers who were 
submitted to evaluations using different functional scales: Lequesne's 
Algofunctional Questionnaire and Oswestry Disability Index, trunk and hip range 
of motion, goniometry, trunk and hip muscle strength assessment using load cell, 
and surface electromyography of the iliocostalis, long dorsal (longissimus), 
gluteus maximus, gluteus medius and tensor fasciae latae muscles. Ten patients 
were randomized into two groups: aquatic physiotherapy with a mean age of 42 
years (range: 25-67) and conventional physiotherapy with a mean age of 49 years 
(range: 43-59). Both groups were submitted to a twelve-week program of two 
sessions weekly.
RESULTS: After the intervention, significant improvements were observed 
regarding the Lequesne index (p-value=0.0217), Oswestry Disability Index 
(p-value=0.0112), range of motion of trunk extension (p-value=0.0320), trunk 
flexion muscle strength (p-value=0.0459), hip extension and abduction muscle 
strength (p-value=0.0062 and p-value=0.0257, respectively). Range of motion of 
trunk and hip flexion, extension, adduction and abduction, trunk extensor muscle 
strength and all surface electromyography variables showed no significant 
statistical difference.
CONCLUSION: Physical therapy is efficient to treat musculoskeletal dysfunctions 
in sickle cell disease patients, irrespective of the technique; however, aquatic 
therapy showed a trend toward improvement in muscle strength. Further studies 
with a larger patient sample and longer periods of therapy are necessary to 
confirm these results.

BACKGROUND: Supratentorial pneumocephalus after posterior fossa surgery in the 
semisitting position may lead to decreased alertness and other symptoms. We here 
aimed to prove the efficacy of normobaric hyperoxia on the absorption of 
postoperative pneumocephalus according to a standardized treatment protocol.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We enrolled 44 patients with postoperative supratentorial 
pneumocephalus (> 30 ml) after posterior fossa surgery in a semisitting 
position. After randomisation procedure, patients received either normobaric 
hyperoxia at FiO2 100% over an endotracheal tube for 3 hours (treatment arm) or 
room air (control arm). Routine cranial CT scans were performed immediately 
(CT1) and 24 hours (CT2) after completion of surgery and were rated without 
knowledge of the therapy arm. Two co-primary endpoints were assessed: (i) mean 
change of pneumocephalus volume, and (ii) air resorption rate in 24 hours. 
Secondary endpoints were subjective alertness (Stanford Sleepiness Scale) 
postoperatively and attention (Stroop test), which were evaluated preoperatively 
and 24 hours after surgery. The mean change in pneumocephalus volume was higher 
in patients in the treatment arm as compared to patients in the control arm (p = 
0.001). The air resorption rate was higher in patients in the treatment arm as 
compared to patients in the control arm (p = 0.0015). Differences were more 
pronounced in patients aged 52 years and older. No difference between patients 
in treatment arm and control arm was observed for the Stroop test. The 
distribution of scores in the Stanford Sleepiness Scale differed in the 
treatment arm as compared to the control arm, and there was a difference in mean 
values (p = 0.015).
CONCLUSIONS: Administration of normobaric hyperoxia at FiO2 100% via an 
endotracheal tube for 3 hours is safe and efficacious in the treatment of 
pneumocephalus after posterior fossa surgery in the semisitting position. 
Largest benefit was found in elderly patients and particularly in older men.

BACKGROUND: Artesunate+amodiaquine (AS+AQ) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) are 
now the most frequently recommended first line treatments for uncomplicated 
malaria in Africa. Artesunate+chlorproguanil-dapsone (AS+CD) was a potential 
alternative for treatment of uncomplicated malaria. A comparison of the efficacy 
and safety of these three drug combinations was necessary to make evidence based 
drug treatment policies.
METHODS: Five hundred and thirty-four, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) 
normal children were randomised in blocks of 15 to the AS+AQ, AL or AS+CD 
groups. Administration of study drugs was supervised by project staff and the 
children were followed up at r home on days 1,2,3,7,14 and 28 post treatment. 
Parasitological and clinical failures and adverse events were compared between 
the study groups.
MAIN FINDINGS: In a per-protocol analysis, the parasitological and clinical 
failure rate at day 28 post treatment (PCF28) was lower in the AS+AQ group 
compared to the AL or AS+CD groups (corrected for re-infections: 6.6% vs 13.8% 
and 13.8% respectively, p = 0.08; uncorrected: 14.6% vs 27.6% and 28.1% 
respectively, p = 0.005). In the intention to treat analysis, the rate of early 
treatment failure was high in all three groups (AS+AQ 13.3%; AL 15.2%; and AS+CD 
9.3%, p = 0.2) primarily due to vomiting. However, the PCF28 corrected for 
re-infection was lower, though not significantly, in the AS+AQ group compared to 
the AL or the AS+CD groups (AS+AQ 18.3%; AL 24.2%; AS+CD 20.8%, p = 0.4) The 
incidence of adverse events was comparable between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: AS+AQ is an appropriate first line treatment for uncomplicated 
malaria in Ghana and possibly in the neighbouring countries in West Africa. The 
effectiveness of AL in routine programme conditions needs to be studied further 
in West Africa.

Artesunate+amodiaquine (AS+AQ) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) are now the most frequently recommended first line treatments for uncomplicated malaria in Africa. Artesunate+chlorproguanil-dapsone (AS+CD) was a potential alternative for treatment of uncomplicated malaria. A comparison of the efficacy and safety of these three drug combinations was necessary to make evidence based drug treatment policies.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
Five hundred and thirty-four, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) normal children were randomised in blocks of 15 to the AS+AQ, AL or AS+CD groups. Administration of study drugs was supervised by project staff and the children were followed up at r home on days 1,2,3,7,14 and 28 post treatment. Parasitological and clinical failures and adverse events were compared between the study groups.

Arab Emirates. subashnie_d@hotmail.com

BACKGROUND: Emergency department (ED) overcrowding is a ubiquitous problem with 
serious public health implications. The fast track area is a novel method which 
aims to reduce waiting time, patient dissatisfaction and morbidity. |The study 
objective was to determine the impact of a fast track area (FTA) on both 
effectiveness measures (i.e. waiting times [WT] and length of stay [LOS]) and 
quality measures (i.e. LWBS rates and mortality rates) in non-urgent patients. 
The secondary objective was to assess if a FTA negatively impacted on urgent 
patients entering the ED.
METHODS: The study took place in a 500 bed, urban, tertiary care hospital in Abu 
Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. This was a quasi-experimental, which examined the 
impact of a FTA on a pre-intervention control group (January 2005) (n = 4,779) 
versus a post-intervention study group (January 2006) (n = 5,706).
RESULTS: Mean WTs of Canadian Triage Acuity Scale (CTAS) 4 patients decreased by 
22 min (95% CI 21 min to 24 min, P < 0.001). Similarly, mean WTs of CTAS 5 
patients decreased by 28 min (95% CI 19 min to 37 min, P < 0.001) post FTA. The 
mean WTs of urgent patients (CTAS 2/3) were also significantly reduced after the 
FTA was opened (P < 0.001). The LWBS rate was reduced from 4.7% to 0.7% (95% CI 
3.37 to 4.64; P < 0.001). Opening a FTA had no significant impact on mortality 
rates (P = 0.88).
CONCLUSION: The FTA improved ED effectiveness (WTs and LOS) and quality measures 
(LWBS rates) whereas mortality rate remained unchanged.

INTRODUCTION: Primary therapeutic aim in treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee 
is to relieve the pain of osteoarthritis. The aim of this study was to compare 
the efficacy of intra-articular triamcinolone with intra-articular morphine in 
pain relief due to osteoarthritis of the knee in the elderly population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients between 50 and 80 years of age were randomized 
into three groups. Group M received morphine plus bupivacaine intra-articularly, 
Group T received triamcinolone plus bupivacaine intra-articularly, and Group C 
received saline plus bupivacaine intra-articularly. Patients were evaluated 
before injection and in 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 12th weeks after injection. 
First-line supplementary analgesic was oral paracetamol 1500 mg/day. If 
analgesia was insufficient with paracetamol, oral dexketoprofen trometamol 50 
mg/day was recommended to patients.
RESULTS: After the intra-articular injection, there was statistically 
significant decrease in visual analog scale (VAS) scores in Groups M and T, when 
compared to Group C. The decrease of VAS scores seen at the first 2 weeks 
continued steadily up to the end of 12th week. There was a significant decrease 
in Groups M and T in the WOMAC scores, when compared to Group C. There was no 
significant difference in the WOMAC scores between morphine and steroid groups. 
Significantly less supplementary analgesics was used in the morphine and steroid 
groups.
CONCLUSION: Intra-articular morphine was as effective as intra-articular 
triamcinolone for analgesia in patients with osteoarthritis knee. 
Intra-articular morphine is possibly a better option than intra-articular 
steroid as it has lesser side effects.

Málaga, Av/ Martiricos s/n, Málaga 29009, Spain. rovalemas@gmail.com

BACKGROUND: The purpose is to assess cardiopulmonary function outcomes and 
quality of life values in inactive people that participated in the Physical 
Activity Promotion Programme (PAPP) against the control group that did not 
perform this program.
METHOD: A total of 100 subjects of both genders participated in the randomized 
controlled trial with systematic random sampling; all were aged 55 and older, 
from Torremolinos, Spain. Participants either received (n = 50) the PAPP for 
60 minutes, twice a week during three months or (n = 50) they received health 
education. The effectiveness of the intervention was measured by general state 
of health the Short Form 12 health survey questionnaire, and the quality of life 
was determined with the EuroQoL-5D questionnaire. Cardiopulmonary function was 
measured with a spirometry and a walking test according to the Bruce protocol.
RESULTS: This pilot study had a significant impact on the quality of life 
(p = 0.05) in men, which increased. However, the quality of life in women did 
not improve. The average changes in the lung and cardiovascular function was not 
significant between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Changes in the quality of life measured with EQ-5D in the group of 
men who carried out the PAPP were statistically significant when comparing 
between groups. However changes in cardiopulmonary function were not as relevant 
when comparing between groups. There was a significant effect within each group 
in the pulmonary outcomes of values in men, within the experimental group.

randomised controlled trial comparing exercise into hypermobile versus neutral 
knee extension.

BACKGROUND: Knee pain in children with Joint Hypermobility Syndrome (JHS) is 
traditionally managed with exercise, however the supporting evidence for this is 
scarce. No trial has previously examined whether exercising to neutral or into 
the hypermobile range affects outcomes. This study aimed to (i) determine if a 
physiotherapist-prescribed exercise programme focused on knee joint strength and 
control is effective in reducing knee pain in children with JHS compared to no 
treatment, and (ii) whether the range in which these exercises are performed 
affects outcomes.
METHODS: A prospective, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial conducted in 
a tertiary hospital in Sydney, Australia compared an 8 week exercise programme 
performed into either the full hypermobile range or only to neutral knee 
extension, following a minimum 2 week baseline period without treatment. 
Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealed by sequentially 
numbered opaque sealed envelopes. Knee pain was the primary outcome. Quality of 
life, thigh muscle strength, and function were also measured at (i) initial 
assessment, (ii) following the baseline period and (iii) post treatment. 
Assessors were blinded to the participants' treatment allocation and 
participants blinded to the difference in the treatments.
RESULTS: Children with JHS and knee pain (n=26) aged 7-16 years were randomly 
assigned to the hypermobile (n=12) or neutral (n=14) treatment group. 
Significant improvements in child-reported maximal knee pain were found 
following treatment, regardless of group allocation with a mean 14.5 mm 
reduction on the visual analogue scale (95% CI 5.2 - 23.8 mm, p=0.003). 
Significant differences between treatment groups were noted for parent-reported 
overall psychosocial health (p=0.009), specifically self-esteem (p=0.034), 
mental health (p=0.001) and behaviour (p=0.019), in favour of exercising into 
the hypermobile range (n=11) compared to neutral only (n=14). Conversely, 
parent-reported overall physical health significantly favoured exercising only 
to neutral (p=0.037). No other differences were found between groups and no 
adverse events occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: Parents perceive improved child psychosocial health when children 
exercise into the hypermobile range, while exercising to neutral only is 
perceived to favour the child's physical health. A physiotherapist prescribed, 
supervised, individualised and progressed exercise programme effectively reduces 
knee pain in children with JHS.

Artemisinin combination therapies are available in private outlets, but patient 
adherence might be compromised by poor advice from dispensers. In this cluster 
randomized trial in drug shops in Tanzania, 42 of 82 selected shops were 
randomized to receive text message reminders about what advice to provide when 
dispensing artemether-lumefantrine (AL). Eligible patients purchasing AL at 
shops in both arms were followed up at home and questioned about each dose 
taken. Dispensers were interviewed regarding knowledge of AL dispensing 
practices and receipt of the malaria-related text messages. We interviewed 904 
patients and 110 dispensers from 77 shops. Although there was some improvement 
in dispenser knowledge, there was no difference between arms in adherence 
measured as completion of all doses (intervention 68.3%, control 69.8%, p 
[adjusted] = 0.6), or as completion of each dose at the correct time 
(intervention 33.1%, control 32.6%, p [adjusted] = 0.9). Further studies on the 
potential of text messages to improve adherence are needed.

Dietary intake/status of the trace mineral Se may affect the risk of developing 
hypertensive conditions of pregnancy, i.e. pre-eclampsia and pregnancy-induced 
hypertension (PE/PIH). In the present study, we evaluated Se status in U.K. 
pregnant women to establish whether pre-pregnant Se status or Se supplementation 
affected the risk of developing PE/PIH. The samples originated from the SPRINT 
(Selenium in PRegnancy INTervention) study that randomised 230 U.K. primiparous 
women to treatment with Se (60 μg/d) or placebo from 12 weeks of gestation. 
Whole-blood Se concentration was measured at 12 and 35 weeks, toenail Se 
concentration at 16 weeks, plasma selenoprotein P (SEPP1) concentration at 35 
weeks and plasma glutathione peroxidase (GPx3) activity at 12, 20 and 35 weeks. 
Demographic data were collected at baseline. Participants completed a FFQ. U.K. 
pregnant women had whole-blood Se concentration lower than the mid-range of 
other populations, toenail Se concentration considerably lower than U.S. women, 
GPx3 activity considerably lower than U.S. and Australian pregnant women, and 
low baseline SEPP1 concentration (median 3.00, range 0.90-5.80 mg/l). Maternal 
age, education and social class were positively associated with Se status. After 
adjustment, whole-blood Se concentration was higher in women consuming Brazil 
nuts (P= 0.040) and in those consuming more than two seafood portions per week 
(P= 0.054). A stepwise logistic regression model revealed that among the 
Se-related risk factors, only toenail Se (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.17, 0.87, P= 0.021) 
significantly affected the OR for PE/PIH. On excluding non-compliers with Se 
treatment, Se supplementation also significantly reduced the OR for PE/PIH (OR 
0.30, 95% CI 0.09, 1.00, P= 0.049). In conclusion, U.K. women have low Se status 
that increases their risk of developing PE/PIH. Therefore, U.K. women of 
childbearing age need to improve their Se status.

implicating the endocannabinoid system in emotional processing. Another main 
constituent of cannabis, cannabidiol (CBD), has seemingly opposite functional 
effects on the brain. This study aimed to determine the effects of THC and CBD, 
both alone and in combination on emotional facial affect recognition. 48 
volunteers, selected for high and low frequency of cannabis use and schizotypy, 
were administered, THC (8mg), CBD (16mg), THC+CBD (8mg+16mg) and placebo, by 
inhalation, in a 4-way, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. They 
completed an emotional facial affect recognition task including fearful, angry, 
happy, sad, surprise and disgust faces varying in intensity from 20% to 100%. A 
visual analogue scale (VAS) of feeling 'stoned' was also completed. In 
comparison to placebo, CBD improved emotional facial affect recognition at 60% 
emotional intensity; THC was detrimental to the recognition of ambiguous faces 
of 40% intensity. The combination of THC+CBD produced no impairment. Relative to 
placebo, both THC alone and combined THC+CBD equally increased feelings of being 
'stoned'. CBD did not influence feelings of 'stoned'. No effects of frequency of 
use or schizotypy were found. In conclusion, CBD improves recognition of 
emotional facial affect and attenuates the impairment induced by THC. This is 
the first human study examining the effects of different cannabinoids on 
emotional processing. It provides preliminary evidence that different 
pharmacological agents acting upon the endocannabinoid system can both improve 
and impair recognition of emotional faces.

The physiologic stress induced by physical activity is reflected in immune 
system perturbations, oxidative stress, muscle injury, and inflammation. We 
investigated the effect of astaxanthin (Asx) supplementation on salivary IgA 
(sIgA) and oxidative stress status in plasma, along with changes in biochemical 
parameters and total/differential white cell counts. Forty trained male soccer 
players were randomly assigned to Asx and placebo groups. Asx group was 
supplemented with 4 mg of Asx. Saliva and blood samples were collected at the 
baseline and after 90 days of supplementation in preexercise conditions. We 
observed a rise of sIgA levels at rest after 90 days of Asx supplementation, 
which was accompanied with a decrease in prooxidant-antioxidant balance. The 
plasma muscle enzymes levels were reduced significantly by Asx supplementation 
and by regular training. The increase in neutrophil count and hs-CRP level was 
found only in placebo group, indicating a significant blunting of the systemic 
inflammatory response in the subjects taking Asx. This study indicates that Asx 
supplementation improves sIgA response and attenuates muscle damage, thus 
preventing inflammation induced by rigorous physical training. Our findings also 
point that Asx could show significant physiologic modulation in individuals with 
mucosal immunity impairment or under conditions of increased oxidative stress 
and inflammation.

Sciences, Faculty of Medical Sciences, The University of the West Indies, St. 
Augustine, Trinidad and Tobago, West Indies.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: This study aimed to determine whether a separate written 
consent form improved the efficacy of the informed consent process for 
anesthesia in adult patients undergoing elective surgery at a tertiary care 
teaching hospital.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We randomized patients into two groups prospectively. The 
first group (Group A) signed the hospital's standard Consent for Operation form 
only while the second group (Group B) signed a separate Consent for Anesthesia 
form additionally. Patients were interviewed postoperatively with an eight-item 
questionnaire with responses in a 5-point Likert scale. A composite adequacy of 
consent index was generated from the responses and analyzed.
RESULTS: Two hundred patients (100 in each group) were studied. All patients 
indicated that the anesthesiologist(s) had their permission to proceed with 
their anesthesia care. The mean adequacy of consent index score in Group B was 
higher than that of Group A (30.6 ± 4.6 [standard deviation (SD)] vs. 27.9 ± 5.2 
[SD]) (P < 0.001). The separate written consent had a positive impact on the 
patients' understanding of the nature and purpose of the intended anesthesia 
procedures (P = 0.04), satisfaction with the adequacy of information provided 
about common side effects (P < 0.001) and rare but serious complications (P = 
0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: A separate written consent for anesthesia improved the efficacy of 
the informed consent process with respect to better information about the nature 
and purpose of anesthesia, common side effects, and rare but serious 
complications.

Combining imagination and reason in the treatment of depression: a randomized 
controlled trial of internet-based cognitive-bias modification and internet-CBT 
for depression.

OBJECTIVE: Computerized cognitive-bias modification (CBM) protocols are rapidly 
evolving in experimental medicine yet might best be combined with Internet-based 
cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT). No research to date has evaluated the 
combined approach in depression. The current randomized controlled trial aimed 
to evaluate both the independent effects of a CBM protocol targeting imagery and 
interpretation bias (CBM-I) and the combined effects of CBM-I followed by iCBT.
METHOD: Patients diagnosed with a major depressive episode were randomized to an 
11-week intervention (1 week/CBM-I + 10 weeks/iCBT; n = 38) that was delivered 
via the Internet with no face-to-face patient contact or to a wait-list control 
(WLC; n = 31).
RESULTS: Intent-to-treat marginal models using restricted maximum likelihood 
estimation demonstrated significant reductions in primary measures of depressive 
symptoms and distress corresponding to medium-large effect sizes (Cohen's d = 
0.62-2.40) following CBM-I and the combined (CBM-I + iCBT) intervention. 
Analyses demonstrated that the change in interpretation bias at least partially 
mediated the reduction in depression symptoms following CBM-I. Treatment 
superiority over the WLC was also evident on all outcome measures at both time 
points (Hedges gs = .59-.98). Significant reductions were also observed 
following the combined intervention on secondary measures associated with 
depression: disability, anxiety, and repetitive negative thinking (Cohen's d = 
1.51-2.23). Twenty-seven percent of patients evidenced clinically significant 
change following CBM-I, and this proportion increased to 65% following the 
combined intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study provides encouraging results of the integration 
of Internet-based technologies into an efficacious and acceptable form of 
treatment delivery. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights

BACKGROUND: Intra-articular analgesia is a pain reliever that is frequently 
administered following arthroscopic knee surgery.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of 
intra-articular application of morphine and tramadol on postoperative pain after 
arthroscopic knee surgery.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: For this randomized double blinded clinical trial, 132 
patients undergoing minor arthroscopic knee surgery were randomly assigned to 
receive either; 5 mg morphine or 50 mg tramadol intra-articularly. Pain was 
evaluated by means of the verbal pain rating score (VRS) preoperatively (at rest 
and on movement of the knee joint) and postoperatively at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 
and 24 hours. Meanwhile, the time of the first analgesic request and need for 
supplemental analgesic were also recorded.
RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in VRS scoring 
between the two groups during the preoperative period either at rest or on knee 
movement. Meanwhile, VRS scores did not differ significantly between the 
morphine and tramadol treated groups postoperatively, except for in the one-hour 
post-operative scores in which the tramadol-treated group experienced less pain 
(P < 0.007). Post-operative VRS scores at 6, 12, and 24 hours were significantly 
decreased when compared with previous scores in both morphine and tramadol 
prescribed subjects (P < 0.001), hence, both local analgesics can significantly 
reduce pain after minor knee surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: We have found a postoperative analgesic effect of intra-articularly 
administered morphine and tramadol following minor arthroscopic knee surgeries 
with a maximum effect 6 hours post injection.

BACKGROUND: To determine the effects of probiotic yogurt on performance and 
health status of young adultfemale endurance swimmers.
METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, 46 endurance swimmers girls with mean 
age of 13.8 ±1.8 years,weight of 48.6±7.5kg and height of 159±5.6cm, were 
studied. Subjects were randomly assigned into two groups,receiving either 400 ml 
probiotic yogurt (intervention group) or ordinary yogurt (control group) daily 
for 8weeks. At the beginning and at the end of the study, the 400-m free 
swimming record was done and the HarvardStep test was employed to measure 
VO2max. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using SPSS software.This 
trial has been registered with IRCT ID of IRCT2012122311849N1.
RESULTS: Average changes in the records of the intervention and control groups 
were 3.9 and 0.5 seconds, respectively(p= 0.22). The intervention group 
complained of dyspnea for 2.4 days and the value for the controlwas 4.4 days 
(p=0.024). Values for ear pain were 0.5 and 1.6 days (p=0.008) respectively. The 
average numberof episodes of respiratory infection in the intervention group was 
0.9 day, which was statistically fewer than thatin the control group (1.4 days), 
P=0.009.
CONCLUSIONS: A reduction in the number of episodes of respiratory infections and 
duration of some symptomssuch as dyspnea and ear pain was observed. Due to the 
reduction in upper respiratory tract infections of theathletes following intake 
of probiotic yogurt, improvement in VO2max is possible.

BACKGROUND: Aging-related reduced spinal mobility can interfere with the 
execution of important functional skills and activities in elderly women. 
Although several studies have shown positive outcomes in response to spinal 
flexibility training programs, little is known about the management of sets and 
repetitions in training protocols. The purpose of this study was to investigate 
the effects of an 8-week specific and standardized flexibility training program 
on the range of spinal motion in elderly women.
METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED IN A SENIOR CENTER OF PALERMO AND RANDOMLY 
ASSIGNED IN TWO GROUPS: trained group (TG) and control group (CG), which 
included 19 and 18 women, respectively. TG was trained for 8 weeks at two 
sessions/week. In particular, every session included three phases: warm up (~10 
minutes), central period (~50 minutes), and cool down (~10 minutes). CG did not 
perform any physical activity during the experimental period. Spinal ranges of 
motion (ROM) were measured from neutral standing position to maximum bending 
position and from neutral standing position to maximum extension position before 
and after the experimental period, using a SpinalMouse® device (Idiag, 
Volkerswill, Switzerland).
RESULTS: After the training period, TG showed an increase in spinal inclination 
by 16.4% (P<0.05), in sacral/hip ROM by 29.2% (P<0.05), and in thoracic ROM by 
22.5% (P>0.05) compared with CG from maximum extension position to maximum 
bending position. We did not observe any significant difference in TG's lumbar 
ROM compared with CG after the training period (P>0.05).
CONCLUSION: We found that an 8-week flexibility training program improved ROMs 
of the spine in elderly women. The training protocol appeared to be practicable 
for active elderly people with autonomy and the capability for self-care.

Aldo Moro n, 8-44124 Cona, Ferrara, Italy. vlc@unife.it.

BACKGROUND: Administration of normal saline might increase circulating levels of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines and may cause variation of plasmatic electrolytic and 
hyperchloremic acidosis, which in turn can impair renal function. Hence the use 
of balanced solutions could influence the inflammatory cascade triggered by the 
surgical procedures, the plasmatic electrolyte concentration, the acid-base 
equilibrium, and the renal function.
METHODS: This is a double blind randomized trial. Forty patients undergoing 
major abdominal surgery (bowel cancer) were allocated in two groups, the 
balanced solution (BS) group in which the fluids administered were balanced 
solutions (colloids and crystalloids); and the unbalanced solution (UBS) group 
in which the fluids administered were unbalanced solutions (colloids and 
crystalloids). Measurements were performed after anaesthesia induction (T0), at 
the end of surgery (T1), within 2 h after surgery (T2) and 24 h after the 
beginning of surgery (T3). The following data were collected: 1) active matrix 
metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and its tissue inhibitor (TIMP-1), IL-6, IL-8, 
IL-10; 2) blood gases variables; 3) electrolytes, albumin, total serum protein 
and the strong ion difference; 4) neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin 
(NGAL) from urinary sample.
RESULTS: The BS group exhibited higher circulating level of IL-10 and TIMP-1 and 
lower level of active MMP-9. The UBS group experienced hypercloremia, 
hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, worse acid-base equilibrium and higher level of 
NGAL.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of balanced solutions was responsible of less alteration of 
plasmatic electrolytes, acid-base equilibrium, kidney function and it might be 
associated with an early anti-inflammatory mechanisms triggering.

This is a double blind randomized trial. Forty patients undergoing major abdominal surgery (bowel cancer) were allocated in two groups, the balanced solution (BS) group in which the fluids administered were balanced solutions (colloids and crystalloids); and the unbalanced solution (UBS) group in which the fluids administered were unbalanced solutions (colloids and crystalloids). Measurements were performed after anaesthesia induction (T0), at the end of surgery (T1), within 2 h after surgery (T2) and 24 h after the beginning of surgery (T3). The following data were collected: 1) active matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and its tissue inhibitor (TIMP-1), IL-6, IL-8, IL-10; 2) blood gases variables; 3) electrolytes, albumin, total serum protein and the strong ion difference; 4) neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) from urinary sample.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
The BS group exhibited higher circulating level of IL-10 and TIMP-1 and lower level of active MMP-9. The UBS group experienced hypercloremia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, worse acid‚Äìbase equilibrium and higher level of NGAL.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
The use of balanced solutions was responsible of less alteration of plasmatic electrolytes, acid‚Äìbase equilibrium, kidney function and it might be associated with an early anti-inflammatory mechanisms triggering.

BACKGROUND: A population of breast cancer patients exists who, for various 
reasons, never received adjuvant post-operative tamoxifen (TAM). This study was 
aimed to evaluate the role of late TAM in these patients.
METHODS: From 1997 to 2003, patients aged 35 to 75 years, operated more than 2 
years previously for monolateral breast cancer without adjuvant TAM, with no 
signs of metastases and no contraindication to TAM were randomized to TAM 20 
mg/day orally for 2 years or follow-up alone. Events were categorized as 
locoregional relapse, distant metastases, metachronous breast cancer, tumours 
other than breast cancer and death from any causes, whichever occurred first. 
The sample size (197 patients per arm, plus 10% allowance) was based on the 
assumption of a 30% decrease in the number of events occurring at a rate of 5% 
annually in the 10 years following randomization. Four hundred and thirty-three 
patients were randomized in the study (TAM 217, follow-up 216). Patients 
characteristics (TAM/follow-up) included: median age 55/55 years, median time 
from surgery 25/25 months (range, 25-288/25-294), in situ carcinoma 18/24, 
oestrogen receptor (ER) positive in 75/68, negative in 70/57, unknown in 72/91 
patients. Previous adjuvant treatment included chemotherapy in 131/120 and an 
LHRH analogue in 11/13 patients.
RESULTS: Thirty-six patients prematurely discontinued TAM after a median of 1 
month, mostly because of subjective intolerance. Eighty-three events (TAM 39, 
follow-up 44) occurred: locoregional relapse in 10/8, distant metastases in 
14/16, metachronous breast cancer in 4/10, other tumours in 11/10 patients. Less 
ER-positive secondary breast cancers occurred in the TAM treated patients than 
in follow-up patients (1 vs 10, p = 0.005). Event-free survival was similar in 
both groups of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: This 5-year analysis revealed significantly less metachronous 
ER-positive breast cancers in the TAM treated patients. No other statistically 
significant differences have emerged thus far.

BACKGROUND: This study was designed to determine whether small diameter needles 
for oocyte retrieval alter oocyte yields in patients undergoing IVF in 
comparison to standard large diameter needles.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective pilot study of 21 consecutive favorable 
prognosis patients. In each patient one ovary was randomly allocated to 
retrieval with either a 20 G/ 35 mm (thin) or 17 G/ 35 mm (standard) needle, the 
other ovary was then retrieved with the opposite needle.
RESULTS: The standard diameter needle was used to collect a total of 215 oocytes 
from 355 aspirated follicles (60.6%) compared to 203 oocytes from 352 aspirated 
follicles (57.7%) with the thinner needle (p = 0.23). Stratifying outcomes by 
anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), as indicator of ovarian reserve, and by body mass 
index (BMI) the oocyte yields, still, did not differ (AMH, r (17) = -0.20, p = 
0.44; BMI, r (17) =0.02, p = 0.96). Outcomes also did not vary among women with 
diminished ovarian reserve (p = 0.17) and in women with normal ovarian reserve 
(p = 1.00). Operating time was, however, significantly increased by 3.3 minutes 
per ovary (z = -3.08, p = 0.002) with the thinner needle.
CONCLUSIONS: Needle diameter does not affect oocyte yield, including in obese 
patients and patients with diminished ovarian reserve. Thinner needles appear to 
significantly prolong operating time.

Saskatchewan, Canada.

BACKGROUND: The present studies evaluated the effects of cryoprotectants, the 
vitrification procedure and time in the warming solution containing sucrose on 
cleavage and embryo development of immature (GV stage) bovine cumulus-oocyte 
complexes (COCs).
METHODS: Two experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, COCs (n = 420) were 
randomly assigned to four groups: 1) CONTROL GROUP: no treatment; 2) VS1 group: 
COCs were exposed to vitrification solution 1 (VS1) containing 7.5% ethylene 
glycol [EG] + 7.5% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] + 20% calf serum [CS] in TCM-199 at 
37 C for 5 min; 3) VS1 + VS2 group: COCs were exposed to VS1 for 5 min followed 
by VS2 (15% EG + 15% DMSO + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS) at 37 C for 45-60 sec; and 
4) Vitrified group: COCs were exposed to VS1 and VS2, loaded on cryotops, 
vitrified in liquid nitrogen and then warmed in TCM-199 + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS 
at 37 C for 1 min. In Experiment 2, COCs (n = 581) were assigned to the same 
groups, but those in VS1, VS1 + VS2 and Vitrified groups were sub-divided and 
exposed to the warming solution for either 1 or 5 min. After treatment and/or 
warming, all COCs in both experiments underwent in vitro maturation, in vitro 
fertilization and in vitro culture.
RESULTS: Cleavage and blastocyst rates did not differ among Control, VS1 and 
VS1 + VS2 groups in either experiment. In Experiment 2, there was no effect of 
time in the warming solution.However, both cleavage and blastocyst rates were 
lower (P < 0.001) in the Vitrified group than in the Control, VS1 and VS1 + VS2 
groups (40.9 and 1.6% vs 92.2 and 34.4%, 79.4 and 25.2%, and 80.2 and 20.8%, 
respectively in Experiment 1, and 25.0 and 1.7% vs 75.3 and 27.2%, 67.9 and 
19.5%, and 62.7 and 22.5%, respectively in Experiment 2).
CONCLUSIONS: The permeating cryoprotectants (EG and DMSO) present in VS1 and VS2 
solutions and the time in the warming solution containing sucrose had no adverse 
effects on cleavage and blastocyst rates of immature bovine COCs. However, 
cleavage rate and early embryo development were reduced following the 
vitrification and warming.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether droxidopa, an oral norepinephrine precursor, 
improves symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH).
METHODS: Patients with symptomatic nOH due to Parkinson disease, multiple system 
atrophy, pure autonomic failure, or nondiabetic autonomic neuropathy underwent 
open-label droxidopa dose optimization (100-600 mg 3 times daily), followed, in 
responders, by 7-day washout and then a 7-day double-blind trial of droxidopa vs 
placebo. Outcome measures included patient self-ratings on the Orthostatic 
Hypotension Questionnaire (OHQ), a validated, nOH-specific tool that assesses 
symptom severity and symptom impact on daily activities.
RESULTS: From randomization to endpoint (n = 162), improvement in mean OHQ 
composite score favored droxidopa over placebo by 0.90 units (p = 0.003). 
Improvement in OHQ symptom subscore favored droxidopa by 0.73 units (p = 0.010), 
with maximum change in ""dizziness/lightheadedness."" Improvement in 
symptom-impact subscore favored droxidopa by 1.06 units (p = 0.003), with 
maximum change for ""standing a long time."" Mean standing systolic blood pressure 
(BP) increased by 11.2 vs 3.9 mm Hg (p < 0.001), and mean supine systolic BP by 
7.6 vs 0.8 mm Hg (p < 0.001). At endpoint, supine systolic BP >180 mm Hg was 
observed in 4.9% of droxidopa and 2.5% of placebo recipients. Adverse events 
reported in ≥ 3% of double-blind droxidopa recipients were headache (7.4%) and 
dizziness (3.7%). No patients discontinued double-blind treatment because of 
adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with symptomatic nOH, droxidopa improved symptoms and 
symptom impact on daily activities, with an associated increase in standing 
systolic BP, and was generally well tolerated.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class I evidence that in 
patients with symptomatic nOH who respond to open-label droxidopa, droxidopa 
improves subjective and objective manifestation of nOH at 7 days.

BACKGROUND: Dexmedetomidine is a useful sedative drug with various uses. We 
designed this study to investigate the clinical effects and complications of 
different loading doses, 0.5 and 1.0 µg/kg.
METHODS: Forty six patients, of American Society of Anesthesiologists physical 
status I and II, who required elective and emergency operation under spinal 
anesthesia were randomly assigned to group L or group H. Group L received a 
loading dose of 0.5 µg/kg for 10 minutes while group H received 1.0 µg/kg. 
Bispectral index (BIS), systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and Ramsay score 
were recorded at T0 (before loading), TL (just after loading) and T10, 20, 30 
(10, 20, 30 minutes after TL). Complications, drug use, lowest BIS and time to 
reach BIS 80 after termination of dexmedetomidine were recorded during this 
study.
RESULTS: In group H, BIS value decreased significantly after TL compared to the 
baseline (T0), while in group L after T10. Between two groups, BIS values showed 
a significant differences only at T10, BIS of group H was lower than that of 
group L. Ramsay score showed no significant differences except in TL; the score 
of group L was significantly lower than that of group H. Other vital signs and 
complications showed a minimal differences between two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher loading dose (1.0 µg/kg) of dexmedetomidine can lead to 
faster sedation without any severe complications.

BACKGROUND: Sacroiliac (SI) joint pain is a prevalent, underdiagnosed cause of 
lower back pain. SI joint fusion can relieve pain and improve quality of life in 
patients who have failed nonoperative care. To date, no study has concurrently 
compared surgical and non-surgical treatments for chronic SI joint dysfunction.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial of 148 subjects 
with SI joint dysfunction due to degenerative sacroiliitis or sacroiliac joint 
disruptions who were assigned to either minimally invasive SI joint fusion with 
triangular titanium implants (N=102) or non-surgical management (NSM, n=46). SI 
joint pain scores, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Short-Form 36 (SF-36) and 
EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) were collected at baseline and at 1, 3 and 6 months after 
treatment commencement. Six-month success rates, defined as the proportion of 
treated subjects with a 20-mm improvement in SI joint pain in the absence of 
severe device-related or neurologic SI joint-related adverse events or surgical 
revision, were compared using Bayesian methods.
RESULTS: Subjects (mean age 51, 70% women) were highly debilitated at baseline 
(mean SI joint VAS pain score 82, mean ODI score 62). Six-month follow-up was 
obtained in 97.3%. By 6 months, success rates were 81.4% in the surgical group 
vs. 23.9% in the NSM group (difference of 56.6%, 95% posterior credible interval 
41.4-70.0%, posterior probability of superiority >0.999). Clinically important 
(≥15 point) ODI improvement at 6 months occurred in 75% of surgery subjects vs. 
27.3% of NSM subjects. At six months, quality of life improved more in the 
surgery group and satisfaction rates were high. The mean number of adverse 
events in the first six months was slightly higher in the surgical group 
compared to the non-surgical group (1.3 vs. 1.0 events per subject, p=0.1857).
CONCLUSIONS: Six-month follow-up from this level 1 study showed that minimally 
invasive SI joint fusion using triangular titanium implants was more effective 
than non-surgical management in relieving pain, improving function and improving 
quality of life in patients with SI joint dysfunction due to degenerative 
sacroiliitis or SI joint disruptions.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Minimally invasive SI joint fusion is an acceptable option 
for patients with chronic SI joint dysfunction due to degenerative sacroiliitis 
and sacroiliac joint disruptions unresponsive to non-surgical treatments.

SI joint pain scores, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Short-Form 36 (SF-36) and EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) were collected at baseline and at 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment commencement. Six-month success rates, defined as the proportion of treated subjects with a 20-mm improvement in SI joint pain in the absence of severe device-related or neurologic SI joint-related adverse events or surgical revision, were compared using Bayesian methods.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS:
Subjects (mean age 51, 70% women) were highly debilitated at baseline (mean SI joint VAS pain score 82, mean ODI score 62). Six-month follow-up was obtained in 97.3%. By 6 months, success rates were 81.4% in the surgical group vs. 23.9% in the NSM group (difference of 56.6%, 95% posterior credible interval 41.4-70.0%, posterior probability of superiority &gt;0.999). Clinically important (‚â•15 point) ODI improvement at 6 months occurred in 75% of surgery subjects vs. 27.3% of NSM subjects. At six months, quality of life improved more in the surgery group and satisfaction rates were high. The mean number of adverse events in the first six months was slightly higher in the surgical group compared to the non-surgical group (1.3 vs. 1.0 events per subject, p=0.1857).

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:
Six-month follow-up from this level 1 study showed that minimally invasive SI joint fusion using triangular titanium implants was more effective than non-surgical management in relieving pain, improving function and improving quality of life in patients with SI joint dysfunction due to degenerative sacroiliitis or SI joint disruptions.

ABSTRACT.CLINICAL RELEVANCE:
Minimally invasive SI joint fusion is an acceptable option for patients with chronic SI joint dysfunction due to degenerative sacroiliitis and sacroiliac joint disruptions unresponsive to non-surgical treatments.",TRUE,

Step-reduction (SR) in older adults results in muscle atrophy and an attenuated 
rise in postprandial muscle protein synthesis (MPS): anabolic resistance. 
Knowing that resistance exercise (RT) can enhance MPS, we examined whether RT 
could enhance MPS following 2 weeks of SR. In addition, as we postulated that SR 
may impair feeding-induced vasodilation limiting nutrient delivery to muscle, we 
also examined whether citrulline (CIT), as an arginine and nitric oxide 
precursor, could attenuate muscle anabolic resistance accompanying SR. We used a 
unilateral leg model to compare older subjects' who had undergone SR to a loaded 
condition of SR plus RT (SR + RT). Thirty older men (70 ± 1 years) underwent 
14 days of SR (<1500 steps/day) with supplementation of either 5 g/day CIT or 
glycine placebo. Throughout SR, subjects performed unilateral low-load RT thrice 
weekly. We assessed muscle protein synthesis in the postabsorptive and 
postprandial state (20 g whey isolate plus 15 g glycine or as micellar-whey with 
5 g CIT or 15 g glycine, n = 10/group). As MPS was similar after ingestion of 
either whey isolate, micellar-whey, or micellar-whey + CIT data related to 
different dietary groups were collapsed to compare SR and SR + RT legs. 
Subjects' daily steps were reduced by 80 ± 2% during SR (P < 0.001) compared 
with baseline. Leg fat-free mass decreased with SR (-124 ± 61 g) and increased 
in the SR + RT (+126 ± 68 g; P = 0.003). Myofibrillar FSR was lower (P < 0.0001) 
in the SR as compared with the SR + RT leg in the postabsorptive 
(0.026 ± 0.001%/h vs. 0.045 ± 0.001%/h) and postprandial states 
(0.055 ± 0.002%/h vs. 0.115 ± 0.003%/h). We conclude that low-load RT, but not 
supplementation with CIT, can attenuate the deleterious effects of SR in aging 
muscle.

OBJECTIVES: The optimal treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 6 is 
unclear owing to its limited geographic distribution. Because of a high 
predictive value of rapid virological response (RVR) for sustained virological 
response (SVR), we conducted an open-label randomized controlled trial to 
compare 24- and 48-week peginterferon/ribavirin combination therapy for patients 
with HCV genotype 6 in Southern China who achieved an RVR.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Treatment-naive, non-cirrhotic patients with chronic 
hepatitis C genotype 6 were treated with pegylated interferon α-2a (180 μg/week) 
and ribavirin (800-1,200 mg, according to weight) for 4 weeks. Patients who 
achieved an RVR, which was defined as HCV RNA negativity at week 4 (<50 IU), 
were randomized to receive either an additional 20 or 44 weeks of treatment (24- 
and 48-week treatment groups, respectively). The primary outcome measure was 
SVR. From January 2011 to June 2014, 152(152/210, 72.4%) patients with HCV 
genotype 6a and RVR were randomized 1:1 to the 24- or 48-week treatment group. 
The SVR rates in the 24- and 48-week groups in the intention-to-treat analysis 
were 90.8% (69/76) and 88.2% (67/76), respectively; those in the per-protocol 
analysis were 95.7% (67/70) and 97.0% (64/66), respectively. More patients in 
the 48-week group had anemia (46.1% vs. 28.9%, P = 0.03), but other adverse 
events were comparable between the groups. The limitation of the present study 
was that only patients from Southern China were enrolled which may inhibit the 
extensive application of the findings.
CONCLUSION: Twenty-four weeks of peginterferon/ribavirin combination therapy was 
non-inferior to 48 weeks in patients with HCV genotype 6a in Southern China who 
achieved an RVR.

BACKGROUND: Despite the growing evidence in the literature there is still a lack 
of consensus regarding the use of minimally invasive surgical technique (MIS) in 
total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
METHODS: A prospective, randomized, international multicentre trial including 69 
patients was performed to compare computer-assisted TKA (CAS-TKA) using either 
mini-midvastus (MIS group) or standard medial parapatellar approach 
(conventional group). Patients from 3 centers (Maastricht, Zwickau, Adelaide) 
with end-stage osteoarthritis of the knee were randomized to either an MIS group 
with dedicated instrumentation or a conventional group to receive cruciate 
retaining CAS-TKA without patella resurfacing. The primary outcome was to 
compare post operative pain and range of motion (ROM). The secondary outcome was 
to measure the duration of surgery, blood loss, chair rise test, quadriceps 
strength, anterior knee pain, Knee Society Score (KSS),WOMAC scores, mechanical 
leg axis and component alignment.
RESULTS: Patients in the MIS group (3.97 ± 2.16) had significant more pain at 2 
weeks than patients in the conventional group (2.77 ± 1.43) p = 0.003. There was 
no significant difference in any of the other primary outcome parameters. 
Surgery time was significantly longer (p < 0.001) and there were significantly 
higher blood loss (p = 0.002) in the MIS group as compared to the conventional 
group. The difference of the mean mechanical leg alignment between the groups 
was not statistically significant (-0.43° (95% CI -1.50-0.64); p = 0.43). There 
was no significant difference of component alignment between the two surgical 
groups with respect to flexion/extension (p = 0.269), varus/valgus (p = 0.653) 
or rotational alignment (p = 0.485) of the femur component and varus valgus 
alignment (p = 0.778) or posterior slope (p = 0.164) of the tibial component.
CONCLUSION: There was no advantage of the MIS approach compared to a 
conventional approach CAS-TKA in any of the primary outcome measurements 
assessed, however the MIS approach was associated with longer surgical time and 
greater blood loss. MIS-TKA in combination with computer navigation is safe in 
terms of implant positioning.

INTRODUCTION: There is debate on renal graft stenting during 
ureteroneocystostomy, patients with ureteral stents may encounter several 
complications such as encrustation, stent crustation which can lead to loss of 
kidney, and complications related to stent extraction: pain and UTI increasing 
related to cystoscopy for stent extraction accompanying excess expenses. This 
study designed to reduce complications related to stent extraction.
MATERIALS & METHODS: 90 patients prepared for renal transplantation during 1 
year randomly classified to groups, study group: patients with attached stent to 
Foley catheter, control group: patients with conventional technique (stent 
separated from Foley) then in their follow up; UTI, stent crustation, luts 
severity compared to each other.
RESULTS: Second week and fourth week UTI reported 25.6%, 2.3% in study group 
versus 34.9%, 4.7% in control group (P.value:0.48 and 0.5). Urinary leakage was 
3.3% overall, that all of them occurred in separate stent group, 37.5% vs. 0% in 
the linked stent group. Stent crustation in separate stent was 25% compared with 
0% in the linked stent.
CONCLUSION: Low complications rate in linked stent group, despite the lack of 
significant statistical differences, but indicate the effectiveness and success 
of the new technique.

BACKGROUND: The increased risk of abacavir in cardiovascular disease (CVD) in 
HIV-infected patients is still being debated. Maraviroc, a CCR5 blocker, has 
been shown to decrease immune activation and monocyte infiltration in 
atherosclerotic plaques in murine experiments. Therefore, we examined the effect 
of maraviroc intensification on flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) in 
abacavir-treated HIV-infected patients and its effect on immunological and 
inflammatory parameters.
METHODS: A open-label prospective crossover study with a duration of 16 weeks: 
8 weeks of intervention (maraviroc intensification) and 8 weeks of control 
(unchanged cART regimen). FMD, HIV-specific variables, expression of HIV 
co-receptors, markers of inflammation and coagulation and cellular markers of 
immune activation were measured at weeks 0, 8 and 16. The changes (Δ) in these 
variables were compared between intervention and control periods using 
non-parametric tests. To evaluate the relation with the change in FMD, linear 
regression modeling was used.
RESULTS: Twenty-one male patients with suppressed plasma HIV-RNA, on cART, had a 
known HIV infection for 9.2 years (IQR 6.9-13.5) with abacavir use for 6.5 years 
(2.8-9.3). A significantly increased FMD of 0.73% (IQR -0.25 to 1.70) was seen 
after maraviroc intensification compared to a decrease of -0.42% (IQR -1.89 to 
0.25; p = 0.049) in the control period. There was a negative relation between 
ΔFMD with ΔD-dimer (β -22.70, 95% CI -39.27; -6.13, p = 0.011) and ΔCD95+ CD4+ T 
cells (β -0.16, 95% CI -0.28; -0.04, p = 0.013), adjusted for age and duration 
of HIV.
CONCLUSION: Maraviroc intensification modestly improves endothelial function in 
HIV-infected patients on an abacavir-containing regimen.

of anaesthesia often causes mild to severe pain or discomfort on injection. We 
designed this double-blind study to compare the efficacy of methylprednisolone 
and lignocaine in reducing the pain of propofol injection in patients scheduled 
for cardiac surgery.
METHODS: A total of 165 adult patients, scheduled for elective cardiac surgery, 
were divided into three groups: saline (group S, n = 55), lignocaine 20 mg 
(Group L, n = 55) and methylprednisolone 125 mg diluted into 2 ml of distilled 
water (Group MP, n = 55). Drugs were administered after tourniquet application 
and occlusion was released after 1 min and 1/4th of the total dose of propofol 
(2 mg/kg) was administered at the rate of 0.5 ml/s. Pain on propofol injection 
was evaluated by four-point verbal rating scale. Statistical methods used 
included Student's t-test and Chi-square test/Fisher's exact test.
RESULTS: The overall incidence of pain was 70.9% in the saline group, 30.9% in 
the lignocaine group and 36.4% in the methylprednisolone group. The intensity of 
pain was significantly less in patients receiving methylprednisolone and 
lignocaine than those receiving saline (P < 0.012).
CONCLUSION: Pre-treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone was found to be as 
effective as lignocaine in reducing propofol injection-induced pain.

OBJECTIVE: The statistical analysis for a 2-arm randomised controlled trial 
(RCT) with a baseline outcome followed by a few assessments at fixed follow-up 
times typically invokes traditional analytic methods (eg, analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA), longitudinal data analysis (LDA)). 'Constrained' longitudinal data 
analysis (cLDA) is a well-established unconditional technique that constrains 
means of baseline to be equal between arms. We use an analysis of fasting lipid 
profiles from the Group Medical Clinics (GMC) longitudinal RCT on patients with 
diabetes to illustrate applications of ANCOVA, LDA and cLDA to demonstrate 
theoretical concepts of these methods including the impact of missing data.
METHODS: For the analysis of the illustrated example, all models were fit using 
linear mixed models to participants with only complete data and to participants 
using all available data.
RESULTS: With complete data (n=195), 95% CI coverage are equivalent for ANCOVA 
and cLDA with an estimated 11.2 mg/dL (95% CI -19.2 to -3.3; p=0.006) lower mean 
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in GMC compared with usual care. With 
all available data (n=233), applying the cLDA model yielded an LDL improvement 
of 8.9 mg/dL (95% CI -16.7 to -1.0; p=0.03) for GMC compared with usual care. 
The less efficient, LDA analysis yielded an LDL improvement of 7.2 mg/dL (95% CI 
-17.2 to 2.8; p=0.15) for GMC compared with usual care.
CONCLUSIONS: Under reasonable missing data assumptions, cLDA will yield 
efficient treatment effect estimates and robust inferential statistics. It may 
be regarded as the method of choice over ANCOVA and LDA.

BACKGROUND: The value of goal-directed fluid therapy in neurosurgical patients, 
where brain swelling is a major concern, is unknown. The aim of our study was to 
evaluate the effect of an intraoperative goal-directed fluid restriction (GDFR) 
strategy on the postoperative outcome of high-risk patients undergoing brain 
surgery.
METHODS: High-risk patients undergoing brain surgery were randomly assigned to a 
usual care group (control group) or a GDFR group. In the GDFR group, (1) fluid 
maintenance was restricted to 3 ml/kg/h of a crystalloid solution and (2) 
colloid boluses were allowed only in case of hypotension associated with a low 
cardiac index and a high stroke volume variation. The primary outcome variable 
was ICU length of stay, and secondary outcomes were lactates at the end of 
surgery, postoperative complications, hospital length of stay, mortality at day 
30, and costs.
RESULTS: A total of 73 patients from the GDFR group were compared with 72 
patients from the control group. Before surgery, the two groups were comparable. 
During surgery, the GDFR group received less colloid (1.9 ± 1.1 vs. 
3.9 ± 1.6 ml/kg/h, p = 0.021) and less crystalloid (3 ± 0 vs. 5.0 ± 2.8 ml/kg/h, 
p < 0.001) than the control group. ICU length of stay was shorter (3 days [1-5] 
vs. 6 days [3-11], p = 0.001) and ICU costs were lower in the GDFR group. The 
total number of complications (46 vs. 99, p = 0.043) and the proportion of 
patients who developed one or more complications (19.2 vs. 34.7%, p = 0.034) 
were smaller in the GDFR group. Hospital length of stay and costs, as well as 
mortality at 30 day, were not significantly reduced.
CONCLUSION: In high-risk patients undergoing brain surgery, intraoperative GDFR 
was associated with a reduction in ICU length of stay and costs, and a decrease 
in postoperative morbidity. Trial registration Chinese Clinical Trial Registry

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The study aimed at comparing the performance of the novel 
optical Airtraq™ laryngoscope with the McCoy™ and conventional Macintosh 
laryngoscopes for ease of endotracheal intubation in patients with neck 
immobilisation using manual inline axial cervical spine stabilisation (MIAS) 
technique.
METHODS: Ninety consenting American Society of Anaesthesiologist's physical 
status I-II patients, aged 18-60 years, scheduled for various surgeries 
requiring tracheal intubation were randomly assigned into three groups of thirty 
each to undergo intubation with Macintosh, Airtraq™, or McCoy™ laryngoscope with 
neck immobilisation by MIAS technique. The ease of intubation based on 
Intubation difficulty scale (IDS) score, Cormack-Lehane grade of glottic view, 
optimisation manoeuvres and impact on haemodynamic parameters were recorded. 
Statistical analysis was performed with ANOVA and Bonferroni correction for post 
hoc tests.
RESULTS: All patients in three groups had a comparable demographic profile and 
were successfully intubated. The Airtraq™ laryngoscope significantly reduced the 
IDS (mean - 0.43 ± 0.81) as compared with both McCoy™ (mean - 1.63 ± 1.49, P = 
0.001) and Macintosh laryngoscope (mean -2.23 ± 1.92, P < 0.001) and improved 
the Cormack-Lehane glottic view (77% grade 1 view and no patients with grade 3 
or 4 view). There were less haemodynamic variations during laryngoscopy with the 
Airtraq™ compared to the Macintosh laryngoscope, but there was not between the 
Airtraq™ and McCoy™ laryngoscope groups.
CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing endotracheal intubation with cervical 
immobilisation, Airtraq™ laryngoscope was superior to the McCoy™ and Macintosh 
laryngoscopes, with greater ease of intubation and lower impact on haemodynamic 
variables.

University, Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University, Shanghai, China.

OBJECTIVE: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is commonly observed after 
eye enucleation and orbital hydroxyapatite implant surgery. This prospective, 
randomized, double-blind trial was conducted to investigate the hypothesis that 
compared with monotherapy using a higher dose of palonosetron, using a lower 
dose of palonosetron in combination with droperidol could reduce the incidence 
of PONV and achieve similar prophylaxis against PONV after the aforementioned 
surgery.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 129 patients who were in the American Society 
of Anesthesiologists Classes I and II, aged between 18 and 70 years, and 
scheduled for eye enucleation and orbital hydroxyapatite implant surgery, were 
enrolled in this study. They were randomized into three groups: Group P2.5 (2.5 
μg/kg palonosetron), Group P7.5 (7.5 μg/kg palonosetron), and Group P+D (2.5 
μg/kg palonosetron and 15 μg/kg droperidol). Patients received the different 
antiemetic regimens intravenously 5 min before surgery. The severity of nausea 
and vomiting and the complete response (CR) rate during a 72-h postoperative 
period were assessed.
RESULTS: All patients completed the trial. The nausea score of Group P2.5 was 
significantly higher than those of the other two groups at 0-4 h and 24-48 h 
(P<0.05). Vomiting scores among all groups were similar during all intervals 
(P>0.05). Compared with Group P2.5, the CR rate was significantly improved at 
all intervals in Group P+D, except at 4-72 h, and was also elevated at 24-72 h 
in Group P7.5 (P<0.05). Fewer patients in Group P2.5 did not experience any 
nausea or vomiting throughout the study (49%) compared with those in Group P7.5 
(67%) and Group P+D (81%; P<0.01).
CONCLUSION: Combining low-dose palonosetron with droperidol potentiated 
prophylaxis for PONV and achieved a similar prophylactic effect as that with a 
higher dose of palonosetron.

Since the prognosis of advanced biliary tract cancer (aBTC) still remains very 
poor, new therapeutic approaches, including immunotherapies, need to be 
developed. In the current study, we conducted an open-label randomized phase II 
study to test whether low dose cyclophosphamide (CPA) could improve 
antigen-specific immune responses and clinical efficacy of personalized peptide 
vaccination (PPV) in 49 previously treated aBTC patients. Patients with aBTC 
refractory to at least one regimen of chemotherapies were randomly assigned to 
receive PPV with low dose CPA (100 mg/day for 7 days before vaccination) 
(PPV/CPA, n = 24) or PPV alone (n = 25). A maximum of four HLA-matched peptides 
were selected based on the pre-existing peptide-specific IgG responses, followed 
by subcutaneous administration. T cell responses to the vaccinated peptides in 
the PPV/CPA arm tended to be greater than those in the PPV alone arm. The 
PPV/CPA arm showed significantly better progression-free survival (median time: 
6.1 vs 2.9 months; hazard ratio (HR): 0.427; P = 0.008) and overall survival 
(median time: 12.1 vs 5.9 months; HR: 0.376; P = 0.004), compared to the PPV 
alone arm. The PPV alone arm, but not the PPV/CPA arm, showed significant 
increase in plasma IL-6 after vaccinations, which might be associated with 
inhibition of antigen-specific T cell responses. These results suggested that 
combined treatment with low dose CPA could provide clinical benefits in aBTC 
patients under PPV, possibly through prevention of IL-6-mediated immune 
suppression. Further clinical studies would be recommended to clarify the 
clinical efficacy of PPV/CPA in aBTC patients.

BACKGROUND: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is increasingly 
recognized as an important cause of myocardial infarction, particularly among 
women. Spontaneous coronary artery dissection survivors may not know what 
physical activity is safe and effective, and there may be a psychosocial burden 
of living with a SCAD diagnosis.
OBJECTIVES: This review aimed to determine the evidence regarding physical 
activity, cardiovascular risk factors, or associated factors, and the 
psychosocial impact of SCAD for SCAD survivors after hospital discharge.
DESIGN: A systematic review was completed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines.
DATA SOURCES: We searched Medline, Embase, CinAHL, PsychInfo, and Google Scholar 
until November 2021.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR STUDY SELECTION: Outcomes of interest were physical 
activity participation levels, cardiovascular risk factors and associated risk 
factors, and psychosocial recovery from SCAD. We included any study (qualitative 
or quantitative) that reported data pertinent to understanding the impact of 
SCAD on physical activity and psychosocial aspects of recovery. We also included 
papers that reported cardiovascular risk or associated risk factors where 
studies reported outcomes of SCAD survivors. We excluded papers that only 
provided information on in-hospital management. Any reports that were 
non-empirical were excluded.
RESULTS: The review included 28 studies. These used a range of methods. None 
were randomized controlled trials. There were 4167 SCAD participants although 
some were sourced from the same SCAD registries, so they may not be unique. They 
were mainly female (n = 3897, 93.5%, range = 57.7-100%), with mean age 48.0 ± 
9.8 years at index event. Participants mostly came from the USA, Canada, or The 
Netherlands. We found very limited evidence for cardiorespiratory fitness 
improvements following cardiac rehabilitation (CR). Existing CR was not tailored 
to SCAD specific needs and SCAD survivors lacked guidance about appropriate 
physical activity. Some participants had high levels of psychosocial distress. 
Spontaneous coronary artery dissection survivors highlighted the need for 
tailored support that included family members. Many SCAD survivors have 
traditional risk factors including hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and 
overweight/obesity. Chest pain following SCAD is common.
CONCLUSION: There is an urgent need to develop physical and psychological 
recovery programmes for SCAD survivors and test effectiveness via randomized 
controlled trials. Psychosocial support is particularly required, given the high 
burden of psychosocial issues.

Although cardiac rehabilitation improves physical fitness after a cardiac event, many eligible patients do not participate in cardiac rehabilitation and the beneficial effects of cardiac rehabilitation are often not maintained over time. Home-based training with telemonitoring guidance could improve participation rates and enhance long-term effectiveness.

ABSTRACT.METHODS AND RESULTS.
We randomised 90 low-to-moderate cardiac risk patients entering cardiac rehabilitation to three months of either home-based training with telemonitoring guidance or centre-based training. Although training adherence was similar between groups, satisfaction was higher in the home-based group (p = 0.02). Physical fitness improved at discharge (p &lt; 0.01) and at one-year follow-up (p &lt; 0.01) in both groups, without differences between groups (home-based p = 0.31 and centre-based p = 0.87). Physical activity levels did not change during the one-year study period (centre-based p = 0.38, home-based p = 0.80). Healthcare costs were statistically non-significantly lower in the home-based group (‚Ç¨437 per patient, 95% confidence interval ‚Äì562 to 1436, p = 0.39). From a societal perspective, a statistically non-significant difference of ‚Ç¨3160 per patient in favour of the home-based group was found (95% confidence interval ‚Äì460 to 6780, p = 0.09) and the probability that it was more cost-effective varied between 97% and 75% (willingness-to-pay of ‚Ç¨0 and ‚Ç¨100,000 per quality-adjusted life-years, respectively).

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.
We found no differences between home-based training with telemonitoring guidance and centre-based training on physical fitness, physical activity level or health-related quality of life. However, home-based training was associated with a higher patient satisfaction and appears to be more cost-effective than centre-based training. We conclude that home-based training with telemonitoring guidance can be used as an alternative to centre-based training for low-to-moderate cardiac risk patients entering cardiac rehabilitation.",FALSE,28534417

BACKGROUND: Inhalation of particulate matter, as part of air pollution, is 
associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Nanoparticles (< 100 nm) are 
likely candidates for triggering inflammatory responses and activation of 
coagulation pathways because of their ability to enter lung cells and pass 
bronchial mucosa. We tested the hypothesis that bronchial segmental instillation 
of carbon nanoparticles causes inflammation and activation of coagulation 
pathways in healthy humans in vivo.
METHODS: This was an investigator-initiated, randomized controlled, 
dose-escalation study in 26 healthy males. Participants received saline 
(control) in one lung segment and saline (placebo) or carbon nanoparticles 
10 μg, 50 μg, or 100 μg in the contra-lateral lung. Six hours later, blood and 
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected for inflammation and 
coagulation parameters.
RESULTS: There was a significant dose-dependent increase in blood neutrophils 
(p = 0.046) after challenge with carbon nanoparticles. The individual top-dose 
of 100 μg showed a significant (p = 0.05) increase in terms of percentage 
neutrophils in blood as compared to placebo.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a dose-dependent effect of bronchial segmental 
challenge with carbon nanoparticles on circulating neutrophils of healthy 
volunteers. This suggests that nanoparticles in the respiratory tract induce 
systemic inflammation.

Aging is associated with sarcopenia and dynapenia, with both processes 
contributing to functional dependence and mortality in older adults. Resistance 
training (RT) and increased protein intake are strategies that may contribute to 
health improvements in older adults. Therefore, the aim was to investigate the 
effects of whey protein (WP) supplementation consumed either immediately pre- or 
post-RT on skeletal muscle mass (SMM), muscular strength, and functional 
capacity in pre-conditioned older women. Seventy older women participated in 
this investigation and were randomly assigned to one of three groups: whey 
protein pre-RT and placebo post-RT (WP-PLA, n = 24), placebo pre-RT and whey 
protein post-RT (PLA-WP, n = 23), and placebo pre- and post-RT (PLA-PLA, n = 
23). Each group ingested 35 g of WP or PLA. The RT program was carried out over 
12 weeks (three times per week; 3 &times; 8⁻12 repetition maximum). Body 
composition, muscular strength, functional capacity, and dietary intake were 
assessed pre- and post-intervention. Two-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for 
repeated measures, with baseline scores as covariates were used for data 
analysis. A time vs. group interaction (p < 0.05) was observed with WP-PLA and 
PLA-WP presenting greater increases compared with PLA-PLA for SMM (WP-PLA = 
3.4%; PLA-WP = 4.2%; PLA-PLA = 2.0%), strength (WP-PLA = 8.1%; PLA-WP = 8.3%; 
PLA-PLA = 7.0%), and the 10-m walk test (WP-PLA = &minus;10.8%; PLA-WP = 
&minus;11.8%; PLA-PLA = &minus;4.3%). Whey protein supplementation was effective 
in promoting increases in SMM, muscular strength, and functional capacity in 
pre-conditioned older women, regardless of supplementation timing. This trial 
was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03247192.

The apparent rationale for the popular use of high doses of neuroleptics in 
psychotic patients is to increase the degree and speed of therapeutic response 
.However, several recent reports have questioned these claims. The present study 
was undertaken with the aim to compare the efficacy of high and low oral doses 
of haloperidol in the treatment of acute and transient psychotic disorders. The 
sample comprised of forty patients of both sexes diagnosed as acute and 
transient psychotic disorder who were randomly assigned to high dose (20 mg/day) 
and low dose (5 mg /day) haloperidol groups with equal number of subjects (n=20) 
in both groups. Weekly assessment was done on Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and 
Haloperidol Side-effects Check List (day 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 & 42). Both groups 
showed significant improvement in BPRS from baseline scores on all assessments. 
Comparison of the improvement rate in both study groups revealed no significant 
difference.

Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran.

BACKGROUND: Although early reviews of clinical findings were mostly negative, 
there is still a widespread belief for the efficacy of preemptive analgesia 
among clinicians. In this study, we evaluated whether the preemptive use of 
ketamine decreases post operative pain in patients undergoing appendectomy.
METHODS: In double-blind, randomized clinical trials, 80 adult male patients 
undergoing an operation for acute appendicitis were studied. Patients were 
randomly assigned to two groups. In the operating room, patients in the ketamine 
group received 0.5 mg/kg of ketamine IV 10 minutes before the surgical incision. 
In the control group, 0.5 mg/kg of normal saline was injected. The pain 
intensity was assessed at time 0 (immediately after arousal) and 4, 12, and 24 
hours postoperatively using the 10 points visual analogue scale (VAS).
RESULTS: Eighty patients (40 for both groups) were enrolled in this study. For 
all of the evaluated times, the VAS score was significantly lower in the 
ketamine group compared to the control. The interval time for the first 
analgesic request was 23.1 ± 6.7 minutes for the case group and 18.1 ± 7.3 
minutes for the control (P = 0.02). The total number of pethidine injections in 
the first 24 hours postoperatively was 0.6 ± 0.6 for the case group and 2.0 ± 
0.8 for the controls (P = 0.032). There were no drug side effects for the case 
group.
CONCLUSIONS: A low dose of intravenously administered ketamine had a preemptive 
effect in reducing pain after appendectomy.

Postprandial hyperglycemia is associated with platelet activation. We thus 
investigated if meal-induced platelet activation could be attenuated by meal 
insulin. A randomized, double-blind, cross-over study was performed to compare 
postprandial platelet activation after premeal injections of placebo or insulin 
aspart (0.1 and 0.2 units/kg) in 18 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM). Platelet activation was assessed by flow cytometry, without and with 
stimulation by the thromboxane analog U46619 or ADP. Measurements were before 
and after premeal blood glucose standardization (to 6-7 mmol/L by insulin 
infusion, if needed) and at 90 min after the meal. Premeal insulin reduced 
postprandial hyperglycemia by 2-3 mmol/L compared with placebo. Postmeal insulin 
levels were doubled with placebo and further elevated with insulin injections. 
The standardized meal enhanced U46619-induced platelet P-selectin expression by 
23% after placebo; this response was more than doubled after premeal insulin. 
U46619-induced fibrinogen binding was unchanged after meal intake with placebo 
but was markedly enhanced (by ~50-60%) after premeal insulin. Postprandial 
platelet activation correlated positively to postprandial insulin levels and 
inversely to glucose levels. Premeal insulin infusion was also associated with 
platelet activation. Our results suggest that postprandial insulin rather than 
glucose accounts for postprandial platelet activation in T2DM patients.

BACKGROUND: Induction of labour (IOL) is one of the commonest obstetric 
interventions, with significant impact on both the individual woman and health 
service delivery. Outpatient IOL is an attractive option to reduce these 
impacts. To date there is little data comparing outpatient and inpatient IOL 
methods, and potential safety concerns (hyperstimulation) if prostaglandins, the 
standard inpatient IOL medications, are used in the outpatient setting. The 
purpose of this study was to assess feasibility, clinical effectiveness and 
patient acceptability of outpatient Foley catheter (OPC) vs. inpatient vaginal 
PGE2 (IP) for induction of labour (IOL) at term.
METHODS: Women with an unfavourable cervix requiring IOL at term (N=101) were 
randomised to outpatient care using Foley catheter (OPC, n=50) or inpatient care 
using vaginal PGE2 (IP, n=51). OPC group had Foley catheter inserted and were 
discharged overnight following a reassuring cardiotocograph. IP group received 2 
mg/1 mg vaginal PGE2 if nulliparous or 1 mg/1 mg if multiparous. Main outcome 
measures were inpatient stay (prior to birth, in Birthing Unit, total), mode of 
birth, induction to delivery interval, adverse reactions and patient 
satisfaction.
RESULTS: OPC group had shorter hospital stay prior to birth (21.3 vs. 32.4 hrs, 
p< .001), IP were more likely to achieve vaginal birth within 12 hours of 
presenting to Birthing Unit (53% vs. 28%, p= .01). Vaginal birth rates (66% OPC 
Vs. 71% IP), total induction to delivery time (33.5 hrs vs. 31.3 hrs) and total 
inpatient times (96 hrs OPC Vs. 105 hrs IP) were similar. OPC group felt less 
pain (significant discomfort 26% Vs 58%, p=.003), and had more sleep (5.8 Vs 3.4 
hours, p< .001), during cervical preparation, but were more likely to require 
oxytocin IOL (88 Vs 59%, p=.001).
CONCLUSIONS: OPC was feasible and acceptable for IOL of women with an 
unfavourable cervix at term compared to IP, however did not show a statistically 
significant reduction in total inpatient stay and was associated with increased 
oxytocin IOL.

OPC group felt less pain (significant discomfort 26% Vs 58%, p = .003), and had more sleep (5.8 Vs 3.4 hours, p &lt; .001), during cervical preparation, but were more likely to require oxytocin IOL (88 Vs 59%, p = .001).

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
OPC was feasible and acceptable for IOL of women with an unfavourable cervix at term compared to IP, however did not show a statistically significant reduction in total inpatient stay and was associated with increased oxytocin IOL.

The current study aimed to observe the effects of sufentanil and remifentanil 
combined with propofol in target-controlled infusion (TCI) on perioperative 
stress reaction in elderly patients. A total of 80 elderly patients requiring 
general anesthesia were recruited. They were divided into four groups (each 
n=20) according to different target concentrations of remifentanil and 
sufentanil. These target concentrations were: 4 ng/ml remifentanil + 0.2 ng/ml 
sufentanil for group I; 3 ng/ml remifentanil + 0.3 ng/ml sufentanil for group 
II; 2 ng/ml remifentanil + 0.5 ng/ml sufentanil for anesthesia induction and 
post-intubation 3 ng/ml remifentanil + 0.2 ng/ml sufentanil for anesthesia 
maintenance for group III; and 5 ng/ml remifentanil for anesthesia induction and 
post-intubation 4 ng/ml remifentanil for anesthesia maintenance for group IV. 
Norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E) and angiotensin II (Ang II) levels in 
plasma were measured prior to the induction of anesthesia, as well as at several 
different time-points following surgery. The numbers of intraoperative severe 
hemodynamic fluctuation, postoperative eye-opening and extubation time, and 
post-extubation restlessness and pain scores were recorded. Group IV had a 
larger circulation fluctuation control number and higher levels of NE, E and Ang 
II at 3 h after surgery than any other group (P<0.01). Although group IV had 
shorter postoperative eye-opening and extubation times compared with the other 
groups (P<0.05), it also had higher restlessness and pain scores (P<0.01). The 
combined use of sufentanil and remifentanil stabilizes perioperative 
hemodynamics and reduces stress hormone levels.

Medicine, Goyang, Korea.

PURPOSE: To compare the short term effects of bevacizumab and ranibizumab 
injections on the regression of corneal neovascularization (NV).
METHODS: Sixteen eyes of 16 patients with corneal NV were randomly assigned for 
an injection with 2.5 mg of bevacizumab (group 1, n = 8) or 1 mg of ranibizumab 
(group 2, n = 8) through subconjunctival and intrastromal routes. The patients 
were prospectively followed-up for one month after the injections. Corneal NV 
areas, as shown on corneal slit-lamp photographs stored in JPEG format, were 
calculated using Image J software before the injection, one week after the 
injection, and one month after the injection. The corneal NV areas were compared 
before and after the injections.
RESULTS: Seven women and nine men, with an average age of 51 years, presented 
with corneal NV secondary to herpetic keratitis (7 cases), graft rejection (6), 
chemical burn (1), pemphigoid (1), and recurrent ulcer (1). In group I, the 
preoperative corneal NV area (8.75 ± 4.33%) was significantly decreased to 5.62 
± 3.86% one week after the injection and to 6.35 ± 3.02% one month after the 
injection (p = 0.012, 0.012, respectively). The corneal NV area in group 2 also 
exhibited a significant change, from 7.37 ± 4.33% to 6.72 ± 4.16% one week after 
the injection (p = 0.012). However, no significant change was observed one month 
after the injection. The mean decrease in corneal NV area one month after 
injection in group 1 (28.4 ± 9.01%) was significantly higher than in group 2 
(4.51 ± 11.64%, p = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Bevacizumab injection resulted in a more effective and stable 
regression of corneal NV compared to the ranibizumab injection. The potency and 
dose of these two drugs for the regression of corneal NV require further 
investigation.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a pre-exercise meal on 
the plasma human growth hormone (hGH) response and fat oxidation during walking. 
Subjects (n=8) were randomly provided with either 1 g/kg body weight of glucose 
in 200 mL water (CHO) or 200 mL water alone (CON) 30 min prior to exercise and 
subsequently walked on a treadmill at 50% of VO2max for 60 min. Plasma hGH 
concentrations were significantly higher in subjects who received CHO compared 
to those who received CON at 15 and 30 min. The fat oxidation rate in the CHO 
was significantly lower than the CON while walking for 5~15, 25~35 and 45~55 
min. Plasma FFA levels were also significantly lower in the CHO compared to the 
CON at 30, 45 and 60 min. Plasma glucose levels in the CHO were significantly 
lower while plasma insulin levels were significantly higher than in the CON at 
15 and 30 min. Therefore, the results of this study suggest that the elevation 
of plasma hGH levels due to the intake of a pre-exercise meal may not be 
strongly related to fat oxidation and plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels during 
low-intensity exercise.

To evaluate the effects of probiotic (VSL#3) and omega-3 fatty acid on insulin 
sensitivity, blood lipids, and inflammation, we conducted a clinical trial in 60 
overweight (BMI > 25), healthy adults, aged 40-60 years. After initial screening 
the subjects were randomized into four groups with 15 per group. The four groups 
received, respectively, placebo, omega-3 fatty acid, probiotic VSL#3, or both 
omega-3 and probiotic, for 6 weeks. Blood and fecal samples were collected at 
baseline and after 6 weeks. The probiotic (VSL#3) supplemented group had 
significant reduction in total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL, and VLDL and had 
increased HDL (P < 0.05) value. VSL#3 improved insulin sensitivity (P < 0.01), 
decreased hsCRP, and favorably affected the composition of gut microbiota. 
Omega-3 had significant effect on insulin sensitivity and hsCRP but had no 
effect on gut microbiota. Addition of omega-3 fatty acid with VSL#3 had more 
pronounced effect on HDL, insulin sensitivity and hsCRP. Subjects with low HDL, 
insulin resistance, and high hsCRP had significantly lower total lactobacilli 
and bifidobacteria count and higher E. coli and bacteroides count.

BACKGROUND: Due to increasing resistance to antibiotics and rising incidence of 
oral diseases, there is a need for alternative treatment modalities to combat 
oral diseases. The aim of the present study was to access the effect of Aloe 
vera mouthwash on the dental plaque in the experimental period of 4 days and to 
compare it with the bench mark control chlorhexidine and placebo (saline water).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 300 systemically healthy subjects were randomly 
allocated into 3 groups: Aloe vera mouthwash group (n=100), control group 
(=100)-chlorhexidene group and saline water-Placebo (n=100). To begin with, 
Gingival index (GI) and plaque index (PI) were recorded. Then, baseline plaque 
scores were brought to zero by professionally cleaning the teeth with scaling 
and polishing. After randomization of the participants into three groups they 
were refrained from regular mechanical oral hygiene measures. Subjects were 
asked to swish with respective mouthwash (Aloe vera mouthwash, 0.2%chlorhexidine 
gluconate mouthwash, or normal saline) as per therapeutic dose for 4 days.
RESULTS: The results showed that Aloe vera mouthrinse is equally effective in 
reducing plaque as Chlorhexidine compared to placebo over a period of 4 days. 
There was a significant reduction on plaque in Aloe vera and chlorhexidine 
groups and no statistically significant difference was observed among them 
(p>0.05). Aloe vera mouthwash showed no side effects.
CONCLUSION: The results of the present study indicated that Aloe vera may prove 
an effective mouthwash due to its ability in reducing dental plaque.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the effects of preoperatively 
administered i.v. hypertonic saline on hypotension following induction of 
general anesthesia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-four patients who scheduled for elective surgery 
were randomly allocated to two groups of 27 patients who received hypertonic 
saline 5% (2.3 ml/kg) or received normal saline (13 ml/kg). Infusion of 
hypertonic saline was done half an hour before induction of anesthesia during 30 
minutes. Anesthesia was conducted in a standard protocol for all patients. Age, 
sex, body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), 
heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were assessed in all patients.
RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 36.68 ± 10.8 years. Forty percent of 
patients were male. The mean SBP at min 2 and min 5, mean of DBP at min 2, 5, 
and 15, mean of HR at all time points and mean of MAP at min 2 and 15 between 
groups were no significantly different (P > 0.05), but mean of SBP at min 10 and

INTRODUCTION: Working memory plays a critical role in cognitive processes which 
are central to our daily life. Neuroimaging studies have shown that one of the 
most important areas corresponding to the working memory is the dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex (DLFPC). This study was aimed to assess whether bilateral 
modulation of the DLPFC using a noninvasive brain stimulation, namely 
transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), modifies the working memory 
function in healthy adults.
METHODS: In a randomized sham-controlled cross-over study, 60 subjects (30 
Males) received sham and active tDCS in two subgroups (anode left/cathode right 
and anode right/cathode left) of the DLPFC. Subjects were presented working 
memory n-back task while the reaction time and accuracy were recorded.
RESULTS: A repeated measures, mixed design ANOVA indicated a significant 
difference between the type of stimulation (sham vs. active) in anodal 
stimulation of the left DLPFC with cathodal stimulation of the right DLPFC 
[F(1,55)= 5.29, P=0.019], but not the inverse polarity worsened accuracy in the 
2-back working memory task. There were also no statistically significant changes 
in speed of working memory [F(1,55)= 0.458,P=0.502] related to type or order of 
stimulation.
DISCUSSION: The results would imply to a polarity dependence of bilateral tDCS 
of working memory. Left anodal/ right cathodal stimulation of DLPFC could impair 
working memory, while the reverser stimulation had no effect. Meaning that 
bilateral stimulation of DLFC would not be a useful procedure to improve working 
memory. Further studies are required to understand subtle effects of different 
tDCS stimulation/inhibition electrode positioning on the working memory.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Targeted radiotherapy of liver malignancies has found to be 
effective in selected patients. A key limiting factor of these therapies is the 
relatively low tolerance of the liver parenchyma to radiation. We sought to 
assess the preventive effects of a combined regimen of pentoxifylline (PTX), 
ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and low-dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) on 
focal radiation-induced liver injury (fRILI).
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma 
who were scheduled for local ablation by radiotherapy (image-guided 
high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy) were prospectively randomized to 
receive PTX, UDCA and LMWH for 8 weeks (treatment) or no medication (control). 
Focal RILI at follow-up was assessed using functional hepatobiliary magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI). A minimal threshold dose, i.e. the dose to which the 
outer rim of the fRILI was formerly exposed to, was quantified by merging MRI 
and dosimetry data.
RESULTS: Results from an intended interim-analysis made a premature termination 
necessary. Twenty-two patients were included in the per-protocol analysis. 
Minimal mean hepatic threshold dose 6 weeks after radiotherapy (primary 
endpoint) was significantly higher in the study treatment-group compared with 
the control (19.1 Gy versus 14.6 Gy, p = 0.011). Qualitative evidence of fRILI 
by MRI at 6 weeks was observed in 45.5% of patients in the treatment versus 
90.9% of the control group. No significant differences between the groups were 
observed at the 12-week follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The post-therapeutic application of PTX, UDCA and low-dose LMWH 
significantly reduced the extent and incidence fRILI at 6 weeks after 
radiotherapy. The development of subsequent fRILI at 12 weeks (4 weeks after 
cessation of PTX, UDCA and LMWH during weeks 1-8) in the treatment group was 
comparable to the control group thus supporting the observation that the agents 
mitigated fRILI.

Targeted radiotherapy of liver malignancies has found to be effective in selected patients. A key limiting factor of these therapies is the relatively low tolerance of the liver parenchyma to radiation. We sought to assess the preventive effects of a combined regimen of pentoxifylline (PTX), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and low-dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) on focal radiation-induced liver injury (fRILI).

ABSTRACT.METHODS AND MATERIALS.
Patients with liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma who were scheduled for local ablation by radiotherapy (image-guided high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy) were prospectively randomized to receive PTX, UDCA and LMWH for 8 weeks (treatment) or no medication (control).

OBJECTIVE: Primary-care (PC) settings may be an opportune place to deliver 
obesity interventions. Scalable interventions utilizing motivational 
interviewing (MI), supported by Internet resources, may overcome obstacles to 
effective obesity treatment dissemination. This study was a randomized 
controlled trial testing two Web-supported interventions, motivational 
interviewing (MIC) and nutrition psychoeducation (NPC), an attention-control 
intervention, in comparison with usual care (UC).
METHODS: Eighty-nine overweight/obese patients, with and without binge eating 
disorder (BED), were randomly assigned to MIC, NPC, or UC for 3 months in PC. 
Patients were assessed independently at post-treatment and at 3-month follow-up.
RESULTS: Weight, triglyceride levels, and depression scores decreased 
significantly in NPC when compared to UC but not MIC; UC and MIC did not differ 
significantly. Weight loss results maintained at 3-month follow-up: 
approximately 25% MIC and NPC patients achieved at least 5% weight loss which 
did not differ by BED status. Fidelity ratings were high and treatment adherence 
was associated with weight loss.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first randomized controlled trial in PC testing MI for 
weight loss to include an attention-control intervention (NPC). NPC, but not 
MIC, showed a consistent pattern of superior benefits relative to UC. BED status 
was not associated, but treatment adherence was associated, with weight loss 
outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Low-dose haloperidol is known to be effective for the prevention of 
postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). However, precise dose-response studies 
have not been completed, especially in patients at high risk for PONV who 
require combination therapy. This study sought to identify which dose of 
haloperidol 1mg or 2mg could be combined with dexamethasone without adverse 
effects in high-risk patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery.
METHODS: Female adults (n = 150) with three established PONV risk factors based 
on Apfel's score were randomized into one of three study groups. At the end of 
anesthesia, groups H0, H1, and H2 were given intravenous (IV) saline, 
haloperidol 1 mg, and haloperidol 2 mg, respectively. All patients were given 
dexamethasone 5 mg during the induction of anesthesia. The overall early (0-2 h) 
and late (2-24 h) incidences of nausea, vomiting, rescue anti-emetic 
administration, pain, and adverse effects (cardiac arrhythmias and 
extrapyramidal effects) were assessed postoperatively. The sedation score was 
recorded in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU).
RESULTS: The total incidence of PONV over 24 h was significantly lower in groups 
H1 (29 %) and H2 (24 %) than in group H0 (54 %; P = 0.003), but there was no 
significant difference between groups H1 and H2. In the PACU, group H2 had a 
higher sedation score than groups H1 and H0 (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: For high-risk PONV patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic 
surgery, when used with dexamethasone, 1-mg haloperidol was equally effective as 
2 mg in terms of preventing PONV with the less sedative effect.

BACKGROUND: Infants undergoing cardiac surgery are at risk of a negative protein 
balance, due to increased proteolysis in response to surgery and the 
cardiopulmonary bypass circuit, and limited intake. The aim of the study was to 
quantify the effect on protein kinetics of a short-term high-protein (HP) diet 
in infants following cardiac surgery.
METHODS: In a prospective, double-blinded, randomized trial we compared the 
effects of a HP (5 g · kg(-1) · d(-1)) versus normal protein (NP, 2 g · kg(-1) · 
d(-1)) enteral diet on protein kinetics in children <24 months, on day 2 
following surgical repair of congenital heart disease. Valine kinetics and 
fractional albumin synthesis rate (FSRalb) were measured with mass spectrometry 
using [1-(13)C]valine infusion. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to investigate 
differences between group medians. Additionally, the Hodges-Lehmann procedure 
was used to create a confidence interval with a point estimate of median 
differences between groups.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight children (median age 9 months, median weight 7 kg) 
participated in the study, of whom in only 20 subjects isotopic data could be 
used for final calculations. Due to underpowering of our study, we could not 
draw conclusions on the primary outcome parameters. We observed valine synthesis 
rate of 2.73 (range: 0.94 to 3.36) and 2.26 (1.85 to 2.73) μmol · kg(-1) · 
min(-1) in the HP and NP diet, respectively. The net valine balance was 0.54 
(-0.73 to 1.75) and 0.24 (-0.20 to 0.63) μmol · kg(-1) · min(-1) in the HP and 
NP group. Between groups, there was no difference in FSRalb. We observed 
increased oxidation and BUN in the HP diet, compared to the NP diet, as a 
plausible explanation of the metabolic fate of surplus protein.
CONCLUSIONS: It is plausible that the surplus protein in the HP group has caused 
the increase of valine oxidation and ureagenesis, compared to the NP group. 
Because too few patients had completed the study, we were unable to draw 
conclusions on the effect of a HP diet on protein synthesis and balance. We 
present our results as new hypothesis generating data.

BACKGROUND: In the United Kingdom, totally implantable venous access systems 
(TIVAS) are not routinely used. Compared with Hickman catheters, these devices 
are more expensive and complex to insert. However, it is unclear whether the 
higher costs may be offset by perceived greater health benefits. This pilot 
trial aimed to generate relevant data to inform the design of a larger 
definitive randomised controlled trial.
METHODS: This was a phase II prospective, randomised, open trial from two UK 
oncology centres. The primary end point was overall complication rate. Secondary 
end points included individual complication rates, time to first complication 
and quality of life. Analysis was by intention to treat. An economic evaluation 
was also carried out.
RESULTS: A total of 100 patients were randomised in a 3 : 1 ratio to receive a 
Hickman or a TIVAS. Overall, 54% of patients in the Hickman arm suffered one or 
more complications compared with 38% in the TIVAS arm (one-sided P=0.068). In 
the Hickman arm, 28% of the devices were removed prematurely due to a 
complication compared with 4% in the TIVAS arm. Quality of life based on the 
device-specific questionnaire was greater in the TIVAS arm for 13 of the 16 
questions. The economic evaluation showed that Hickman arm was associated with 
greater mean cost per patient £1803 (95% CI 462, 3215), but similar 
quality-adjusted life years -0.01 (95% CI -0.15, 0.15) than the TIVAS arm. 
However, there is much uncertainty associated with the results.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with Hickman catheters, TIVAS may be the cost-effective 
option. A larger multicentre trial is needed to confirm these preliminary 
findings.

BACKGROUND: The present study examined the effects of a balance-based exergaming 
intervention using the Kinect sensor on postural stability and balance in people 
with Parkinson's disease (PD).
METHODS: We conducted a subject-blinded, randomized controlled study. Twenty 
people with PD (Hoehn and Yahr stages I through III) were recruited and randomly 
assigned to either a balance-based exergaming group (N = 10) or a balance 
training group (N = 10) for an 8-week balance training period. Postural 
stability was assessed using the limits of stability (LOS) and one-leg stance 
(OLS) tests. Balance was assessed using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and the 
timed up and go (TUG) test. Participants were assessed pre- and post-training.
RESULTS: After training, participants in the balance-based exergaming group 
showed significant improvements in LOS performance, and in the eyes-closed 
condition of the OLS test. Both training programs led to improvements in BBS and 
TUG performance. Furthermore, balance-based exergaming training resulted in 
significantly better performance in directional control in the LOS test 
(78.9 ± 7.65 %) compared with conventional balance training (70.6 ± 9.37 %).
CONCLUSIONS: Balance-based exergaming training resulted in a greater improvement 
in postural stability compared with conventional balance training. Our results 
support the therapeutic use of exergaming aided by the Kinect sensor in people 
with PD.

BACKGROUND: Recently, the use of ketamine as a systemic and local analgesic drug 
in reducing post-operative pain is studied more frequently.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to assess the analgesic efficacy of 
IV ketamine injection inaddition to nephrostomy tract infiltration of 
ketamine-bupivacaine on postoperative pain relief after tubeless percutaneous 
nephrolithotomy (PCNL).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 100), with renal stone who were candidates 
for PCNL were randomized to five groups with 20 cases in each: Group C, 10 mL of 
saline solution was infiltrated into the nephrostomy tract; Group B, 10 mL of 
0.25% bupivacaine was infiltrated into the nephrostomy tract; Group BK1, 10 mL 
of 0.25% bupivacaine plus 0.5 mg/kg ketamine was infiltrated into the 
nephrostomy tract; Group BK2, 10 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine plus 1.5 mg/kg ketamine 
was infiltrated into the nephrostomy tract; Group K, 10 mL of saline solution 
containing 0.5 mg/kg ketamine was intravenously administered. Post-operative 
pain scores were compared between groups as the primary objective. Comparison of 
Sedation Scores, rescue analgesic consumption, time to the first rescue 
analgesics administration, hemodynamic and SpO2 values were regarded as the 
secondary objective.
RESULTS: Mean VAS scores in the first 30 min and total analgesic consumption in 
the first 24 h of post-operative period were significantly lower in groups BK1 
and BK2 in comparison with the other groups (P < 0.05). Also, time to first 
rescue analgesics administration was longer in the same groups (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Infiltration of ketamine plus bupivacaine provides superior 
analgesic effects in PCNL surgery compared with other methods.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of carbonated 
water on etched or sealed enamel according to the carbonation level and the 
presence of calcium ions.
METHODS: Carbonated water with different carbonation levels was manufactured by 
a soda carbonator. Seventy-five premolar teeth were randomly divided into a 
control group and 4 experimental groups in accordance with the carbonation level 
and the presence of calcium ions in the test solutions. After specimen 
preparation of the Unexposed, Etched, and Sealed enamel subgroups, all the 
specimens were submerged in each test solution for 15 minutes three times a day 
during 7 days. Microhardness tests on the Unexposed and Etched enamel subgroups 
were performed with 10 specimens from each group. Scanning electron microscopy 
(SEM) tests on the Unexposed, Etched, and Sealed enamel subgroups were performed 
with 5 specimens from each group. Microhardness changes in different groups were 
statistically compared using paired t-tests, the Wilcoxon signed rank test, and 
the Kruskal-Wallis test.
RESULTS: The microhardness changes were significantly different between the 
groups (p = 0.000). The microhardness changes in all experimental groups except 
Group 3 (low-level carbonated water with calcium ions) were significantly 
greater than those in the Control group. SEM showed that etched areas of the 
specimen were affected by carbonated water and the magnitude of destruction 
varied between groups. Adhesive material was partially removed in groups exposed 
to carbonated water.
CONCLUSIONS: Carbonated water has negative effects on etched or sealed enamel, 
resulting in decreased microhardness and removal of the adhesive material.

Integrated regulations for medical and nursing care in long-term care: 
qualitative results of the process evaluation: Innovative form of care in 
long-term care Abstract: Background: Long-term care patients, most of whom 
suffer from multimorbidity, are dependent on appropriate medical and nursing 
care. Inadequate interdisciplinary cooperation structures and processes pose a 
challenge for nursing care when residents' conditions deteriorate and can lead 
to hospital admissions that could potentially be avoided. Objective: Structures 
and processes of interdisciplinary cooperation were developed and implemented as 
part of the SaarPHIR innovation fund project ""Saarländische PflegeHeim 
Versorgung Integriert Regelhaft"". The aims of the qualitative part of the 
process evaluation were the subjective assessment of the structural and process 
level of the complex intervention across all project phases from the perspective 
of the participants as well as an analysis of the context factors. Method: 
Qualitative interviews were conducted with all participating facilities and the 
medical care communities formed as part of the project in order to record the 
subjective experiences gained in the implementation and impact of the complex 
intervention. The data analysis was carried out using qualitative content 
analysis. Results: Both professional groups perceive a structural organizational 
change that has a positive effect on interdisciplinary cooperation. The benefits 
in terms of care are rated as high. Conclusion: Various measures (e.g. 
pre-weekend ward rounds, extended on-call duty) at the structural and process 
level should be retained when transferring to standard care.

Publisher: Zusammenfassung: Hintergrund: Die zumeist von Multimorbidität 
betroffenen Pflegebedürftigen in der Langzeitpflege sind auf eine angemessene 
medizinisch-pflegerische Versorgung angewiesen. Unzureichende interdisziplinäre 
Kooperationsstrukturen und -prozesse stellen bei Zustandsverschlechterung von 
Bewohner_innen für die Pflege eine Herausforderung dar und können zu 
Krankenhauseinweisungen führen, die potenziell vermeidbar wären. Ziel: Im Rahmen 
des Innovationsfonds-Projektes SaarPHIR „Saarländische PflegeHeim Versorgung 
Integriert Regelhaft“ wurden Strukturen und Prozesse der interdisziplinären 
Kooperation entwickelt und umgesetzt. Ziele des qualitativen Teils der 
Prozessevaluation waren die subjektive Bewertung der Struktur- und Prozessebene 
der komplexen Intervention über alle Projektphasen aus Sicht der Beteiligten 
sowie eine Analyse der Kontextfaktoren. Methode: Zur Erfassung der subjektiven 
Erfahrungen in Durchführung und Auswirkung der komplexen Intervention wurden 
qualitative Befragungen mit allen teilnehmenden Einrichtungen und den im Rahmen 
des Projektes gebildeten ärztlichen Versorgergemeinschaften durchgeführt. Die 
Datenanalyse erfolgte mittels qualitativer Inhaltsanalyse. Ergebnisse: Beide 
Berufsgruppen nehmen einen strukturellen Organisationswandel wahr, der sich 
positiv auf die interdisziplinäre Zusammenarbeit auswirkt. Der Nutzen 
hinsichtlich der Versorgung wird als hoch bewertet. Schlussfolgerung: 
Verschiedene Maßnahmen (z.B. Vor-Wochenend-Visite, erweiterte Rufbereitschaft) 
auf der Struktur- und Prozessebene sollten bei Überführung in die 
Regelversorgung beibehalten werden.

ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND AND AIMS::
Recent studies have shown that etomidate is associated with fewer serious adverse events than propofol and has a noninferior sedative effect. We investigated whether etomidate‚Äìmidazolam is associated with fewer cardiopulmonary adverse events and has noninferior efficacy compared to propofol‚Äìmidazolam for screening colonoscopy in the elderly.

ABSTRACT.METHODS::
A prospective, single-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial was performed. Patients aged over 65 years who were scheduled to undergo screening colonoscopy were randomized to receive either etomidate or propofol based on midazolam. The primary outcome was all cardiopulmonary adverse events. The secondary outcomes were vital sign fluctuation (VSF), adverse events disturbing the procedure, and sedation-related outcomes.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS::
The incidence of cardiopulmonary adverse events was higher in the propofol group (72.6%) than in the etomidate group (54.8%) (P‚Ää=‚Ää.040). VSF was detected in 17 (27.4%) and 31 (50.0%) patients in the etomidate and propofol groups, respectively (P‚Ää=‚Ää.010). The incidence rate of adverse events disturbing the procedure was significantly higher in the etomidate group (25.8%) than in the propofol group (8.1%) (P‚Ää=‚Ää.008). Moreover, the incidence rate of myoclonus was significantly higher in the etomidate group (16.1%) than in the propofol group (1.6%) (P‚Ää=‚Ää.004). There was no statistical significance between the 2 groups with respect to sedation times and sedation-related outcomes including patients‚Äô and endoscopist's satisfaction. In the multivariate analysis, the etomidate group had significantly low odds ratio (OR) associated with VSF (OR: 0.407, confidence interval: 0.179‚Äì0.926, P‚Ää=‚Ää.032).

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS::
We recommend using etomidate‚Äìmidazolam in patients with high ASA score or vulnerable to risk factors; propofol‚Äìmidazolam may be used as a guideline in patients with low ASA score.",FALSE,29768328

Hospital, P,M,B 12003, Lagos, Nigeria. tuntop@yahoo.com

BACKGROUND: The apparent interactions between the mechanisms of action of 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and steroids suggest that 
co-therapy may provide beneficial inflammatory and pain relief in the absence of 
side effects. The aim of the study was to compare the effect of co-administered 
dexamethasone and diclofenac potassium (diclofenac K) with diclofenac K alone on 
the postoperative pain, swelling and trismus after surgical removal of third 
molars.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective randomized double-blind study was conducted 
at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Lagos University Teaching 
Hospital, Nigeria. A total of 100 patients were randomly allocated to two 
treatment groups of dexamethasone (prophylactic 8 mg and postoperative 4 mg IV) 
and diclofenac K (50 mg Oral before and after surgery), and diclofenac K alone 
(as with first group). The overall analgesic efficacy of the drug combinations 
was assessed postoperatively by determination of pain intensity using a category 
rating scale. Facial swelling was measured using a tape measure placed from 
tragus to gonion to tragus, while interincisal mouth-opening of patients was 
measured using a vernier calibrated caliper pre-operatively and 
post-operatively.
RESULTS: Co-administration of dexamethasone and diclofenac K was significantly 
superior to diclofenac alone for the relief of pain (P < 0.05), and facial 
swelling up to post-operative 48 hour (P < 0.05). However, there was no 
significant difference for trismus relief between the two medication protocols 
(P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: This study illustrates enhanced effects of co-administered 
dexamethasone and diclofenac K on short-term post-operative pain and swelling, 
compared to diclofenac potassium alone in third molar surgery.

BACKGROUND: Afghanistan's national guidelines recommend chloroquine for the 
treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection, the parasite responsible for the 
majority of its malaria burden. Chloroquine resistance in P. vivax is emerging 
in Asia. Therapeutic responses across Afghanistan have not been evaluated in 
detail.
METHODS: Between July 2007 and February 2009, an open-label, randomized 
controlled trial of chloroquine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in patients 
aged three months and over with slide-confirmed P. vivax mono-infections was 
conducted. Consistent with current national guidelines, primaquine was not 
administered. Subjects were followed up daily during the acute phase of illness 
(days 0-3) and weekly until day 56. The primary endpoint was the overall 
cumulative parasitological failure rate at day 56 after the start of treatment, 
with the hypothesis being that dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine was non-inferior 
compared to chloroquine (Delta = 5% difference in proportion of failures).
RESULTS: Of 2,182 individuals with positive blood films for P. vivax, 536 were 
enrolled in the trial. The day 28 cure rate was 100% in both treatment groups. 
Parasite clearance was more rapid with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine than 
chloroquine. At day 56, there were more recurrent infections in the chloroquine 
arm (8.9%, 95% CI 6.0-13.1%) than the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine arm (2.8%, 
95% CI 1.4-5.8%), a difference in cumulative recurrence rate of 6.1% (2-sided 
90%CI +2.6 to +9.7%). The log-rank test comparing the survival curves confirmed 
the superiority of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine over chloroquine (p = 0.003). 
Multivariate analysis showed that a lower initial haemoglobin concentration was 
also independently associated with recurrence. Both regimens were well tolerated 
and no serious adverse events were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Chloroquine remains an efficacious treatment for the treatment of 
vivax malaria in Afghanistan. In a setting where radical therapy cannot be 
administered, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine provides additional benefit in 
terms of post-treatment prophylaxis, reducing the incidence of recurrence from 
4-8 weeks after treatment.

BACKGROUND: Mental health problems are common and are associated with increased 
disability and health care costs. Problem-Solving Treatment (PST) delivered to 
these patients by nurses in primary care might be efficient. The aim of this 
study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PST by mental health nurses 
compared with usual care (UC) by the general practitioner for primary care 
patients with mental health problems.
METHODS: An economic evaluation from a societal perspective was performed 
alongside a randomized clinical trial. Patients with a positive General Health 
Questionnaire score (score ≥ 4) and who visited their general practitioner at 
least three times during the past 6 months were eligible. Outcome measures were 
improvement on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and QALYs based on the 
EQ-5D. Resource use was measured using a validated questionnaire. Missing cost 
and effect data were imputed using multiple imputation techniques. Bootstrapping 
was used to analyze costs and cost-effectiveness of PST compared with UC.
RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in clinical 
outcomes at 9 months. Mean total costs were €4795 in the PST group and €6857 in 
the UC group. Costs were not statistically significantly different between the 
two groups (95% CI -4698;359). The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that PST 
was cost-effective in comparison with UC. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these 
findings.
CONCLUSIONS: PST delivered by nurses seems cost-effective in comparison with UC. 
However, these results should be interpreted with caution, since the difference 
in total costs was mainly caused by 3 outliers with extremely high indirect 
costs in the UC group.

Medicine, Seoul, Korea.

PURPOSE: We evaluated the efficacy of alfuzosin for the treatment of ureteral 
calculi less than 10 mm in diameter after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy 
(ESWL).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized, single-blind clinical trial was performed 
prospectively by one physician between June 2010 and August 2011. A total of 84 
patients with ureteral calculi 5 to 10 mm in diameter were divided into two 
groups. Alfuzosin 10 mg (once daily) and loxoprofen sodium 68.1 mg (as needed) 
were prescribed to group 1 (n=41), and loxoprofen sodium 68.1 mg (as needed) 
only was prescribed to group 2 (n=44). The drug administration began immediately 
after ESWL and continued until stone expulsion was confirmed up to a maximum of 
42 days after the procedure.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine of 41 (95.1%) patients in group 1 and 40 of 43 (93.0%) 
patients in group 2 ultimately passed stones (p=0.96). The number of ESWL 
sessions was 1.34±0.65 and 1.41±0.85 in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p=0.33). 
The patients who required analgesics after ESWL were 8 (19.5%) in group 1 and 13 
(30.2%) in group 2 (p=0.31). Visual analogue scale pain severity scores were 
5.33±1.22 and 6.43±1.36 in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p=0.056). The time to 
stone expulsion in groups 1 and 2 was 9.5±4.8 days and 14.7±9.8 days, 
respectively (p=0.005). No significant adverse effects occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of alfuzosin in combination with ESWL seems to facilitate 
stone passage and to reduce the time of stone expulsion but does not affect the 
stone-free rate.

The number of ESWL sessions was 1.34¬±0.65 and 1.41¬±0.85 in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p=0.33). The patients who required analgesics after ESWL were 8 (19.5%) in group 1 and 13 (30.2%) in group 2 (p=0.31). Visual analogue scale pain severity scores were 5.33¬±1.22 and 6.43¬±1.36 in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p=0.056). The time to stone expulsion in groups 1 and 2 was 9.5¬±4.8 days and 14.7¬±9.8 days, respectively (p=0.005). No significant adverse effects occurred.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:
The use of alfuzosin in combination with ESWL seems to facilitate stone passage and to reduce the time of stone expulsion but does not affect the stone-free rate.",TRUE,

OBJECTIVE: The Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes 
(BARI 2D) trial demonstrated similar long-term clinical effectiveness of 
insulin-sensitizing (IS) versus insulin-providing (IP) treatments for type 2 
diabetes on cardiovascular outcomes in a cohort with documented coronary artery 
disease. We evaluated the effects of randomized glycemic control strategy (IS 
vs. IP) on the prevalence and incidence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: DPN (defined as Michigan Neuropathy Screening 
Instrument [MNSI] clinical examination score>2) was assessed at baseline and 
yearly for 4 years. DPN prevalence and incidence were compared by 
intention-to-treat modeling by logistic generalized estimating equation models 
for prevalence and Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox regression models for 
incidence rates.
RESULTS: Results are reported for 2,159 BARI 2D participants (70% males) with 
valid baseline and at least one follow-up MNSI score (mean age 62±9 years, mean 
HbA1c 7.7±1.6%, diabetes duration 10±9 years). There were no differences in the 
prevalence of DPN between the IS and the IP groups throughout the 4 years of 
follow-up. In 1,075 BARI 2D participants with no DPN at baseline, the 4-year 
cumulative incidence rate of DPN was significantly lower in the IS (66%) than in 
the IP (72%) strategy group (P=0.02), which remained significant after adjusting 
for the in-trial HbA1c (P=0.04). In subgroup analyses, IS strategy had a greater 
benefit in men (hazard ratio 0.75 [99% CI 0.58-0.99], P<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with type 2 diabetes followed for up to 4 years 
during BARI 2D, a glycemic control therapy with IS significantly reduced the 
incidence of DPN compared with IP therapy and may add further benefit for men.

OBJECTIVE: Genetic variants near IRS1 are associated with features of the 
metabolic syndrome (MetS). We examined whether genetic variants near IRS1 might 
modulate the effects of diets varying in fat content on the MetS status in a 
2-year weight-loss trial.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Two variants near IRS1, rs1522813 and rs2943641, 
were genotyped in 738 overweight/obese adults (age 60 ± 9 years; BMI 32.7 ± 3.9 
kg/m2) randomly assigned to one of four weight-loss diets (a deficit of 750 
kcal/day of caloric intake from baseline) varying in macronutrient contents for 
2 years. We compared MetS status of high-fat (40% of caloric intake; n = 370) 
and low-fat (20% caloric intake; n = 368) diet groups differentiated by 
genotypes (rs1522813 A-allele carriers and noncarriers and rs2943641T-allele 
carriers and noncarriers).
RESULTS: Among rs1522813 A-allele carriers, the reversion rates of the MetS were 
higher in the high-fat diet group than those in the low-fat diet group over the 
2-year intervention (P = 0.002), while no significant difference between diet 
groups was observed among noncarriers (P = 0.27). The genetic modulation on 
dietary effect was independent of weight changes. The odds ratio (OR) for the 
2-year reversion of the MetS was 2.88 (95% CI 1.25-6.67) comparing the high-fat 
and low-fat diets among rs1522813 A-allele carriers, while the corresponding OR 
was 0.83 (0.36-1.92) in noncarriers. The variant rs2943641 was not observed to 
modulate dietary effects on the MetS status.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that high-fat weight-loss diets might be more 
effective in the management of the MetS compared with low-fat diets among 
individuals with the A-allele of the rs1522813 variant near IRS1.

BACKGROUND: Persistent neuroinflammation and disruptions in brain energy 
metabolism is commonly seen in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Because of the lack 
of success of most TBI interventions and the documented benefits of 
environmental enrichment (EE) in enhancing brain plasticity, here we focused our 
study on use of EE in regulating injury-induced neuroinflammation and 
disruptions in energy metabolism in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Adult 
male Wistar rats were used in the study and randomly assigned to receive either: 
mild TBI (mTBI) using the controlled cortical injury model or sham surgery. 
Following surgery, rats from each group were further randomized to either: EE 
housing or standard laboratory housing (CON). After 4 weeks of recovery, 
cognitive testing was performed using the non-matching-to-sample and delayed 
non-matching-to-sample tasks. After completion of behavioral testing, levels of 
the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α and the anti-inflammatory 
cytokine IL-10 were measured. In addition, levels of AMPK (adenosine 
monophosphate-activated protein kinase), phosphorylated AMPK and uMtCK 
(ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase) were assessed as measures of brain 
energy homeostasis.
RESULTS: Our results showed that EE: (1) decreased the pro-inflammatory 
cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α and enhanced levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine 
IL-10 after mTBI; (2) mitigated mTBI-induced cognitive impairment; and (3) 
attenuated mTBI-induced downregulation in pAMPK/AMPK ratio and uMtCK levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated the potential of EE to modulate the 
persistent: (1) neuroinflammatory response seen following mTBI, and (2) 
persistent disturbance in brain energy homeostasis. It is possible that through 
the mechanism of modulating neuroinflammation, EE housing was able to restore 
the disruption in energy metabolism and enhanced functional recovery after mTBI.

NicVAX, a nicotine vaccine (3'AmNic-rEPA), has been clinically evaluated to 
determine whether higher antibody (Ab) concentrations are associated with higher 
smoking abstinence rates and whether dosages and frequency of administration are 
associated with increased Ab response. This randomized, double-blinded, 
placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial (N = 301 smokers) tested the 
results of 200- and 400-µg doses administered four or five times over a period 
of 6 months, as compared with placebo. 3'AmNic-rEPA recipients with the highest 
serum antinicotine Ab response (top 30% by area under the curve (AUC)) were 
significantly more likely than the placebo recipients (24.6% vs. 12.0%, P = 
0.024, odds ratio (OR) = 2.69, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.14-6.37) to 
attain 8 weeks of continuous abstinence from weeks 19 through 26. The 
five-injection, 400-µg dose regimen elicited the greatest Ab response and 
resulted in significantly higher abstinence rates than placebo. This study 
demonstrates, as proof of concept, that 3'AmNic-rEPA elicits Abs to nicotine and 
is associated with higher continuous abstinence rates (CAR). Its further 
development as a treatment for nicotine dependence is therefore justified.

Fracture risk in type 2 diabetes is increased despite normal or high bone 
mineral density, implicating poor bone quality as a risk factor. Raloxifene 
improves bone material and mechanical properties independent of bone mineral 
density. This study aimed to determine if raloxifene prevents the negative 
effects of diabetes on skeletal fragility in diabetes-prone rats. Adult Zucker 
Diabetic Sprague-Dawley (ZDSD) female rats (20-week-old, n = 24) were fed a 
diabetogenic high-fat diet and were randomized to receive daily subcutaneous 
injections of raloxifene or vehicle for 12 weeks. Blood glucose was measured 
weekly and glycated hemoglobin was measured at baseline and 12 weeks. At 
sacrifice, femora and lumbar vertebrae were harvested for imaging and mechanical 
testing. Raloxifene-treated rats had a lower incidence of type 2 diabetes 
compared with vehicle-treated rats. In addition, raloxifene-treated rats had 
blood glucose levels significantly lower than both diabetic vehicle-treated rats 
as well as vehicle-treated rats that did not become diabetic. Femoral toughness 
was greater in raloxifene-treated rats compared with both diabetic and 
non-diabetic vehicle-treated ZDSD rats, due to greater energy absorption in the 
post-yield region of the stress-strain curve. Similar differences between groups 
were observed for the structural (extrinsic) mechanical properties of 
energy-to-failure, post-yield energy-to-failure, and post-yield displacement. 
These results show that raloxifene is beneficial in preventing the onset of 
diabetes and improving bone material properties in the diabetes-prone ZDSD rat. 
This presents unique therapeutic potential for raloxifene in preserving bone 
quality in diabetes as well as in diabetes prevention, if these results can be 
supported by future experimental and clinical studies.

PURPOSE: This randomized controlled, clinical prospective interventional trial 
was aimed at exploring the effect of patient empowerment on short- and long-term 
outcomes after major oncologic surgery in elderly cancer patients.
METHODS: This trial was performed from February 2011 to January 2014 at two 
tertiary medical centers in Germany. The study included patients aged 65 years 
and older undergoing elective surgery for gastro-intestinal, genitourinary, and 
thoracic cancer. The patients were randomly assigned to the intervention group, 
i.e. patient empowerment through information booklet and diary keeping, or to 
the control group, which received standard care. Randomization was done by block 
randomization in blocks of four in order of enrollment. The primary outcome were 
1,postoperative length of hospital stay (LOS) and 2. long-term global 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) one year postoperatively. HRQoL was 
assessed using the EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire. Secondary outcomes encompassed 
postoperative stress and complications. Further objectives were the 
identification of predictors of LOS, and HRQoL at 12 months.
RESULTS: Overall 652 patients were included. The mean age was 72 ± 4.9 years, 
and the majority of patients were male (68.6%, n = 447). The ^median of 
postoperative length of stay was 9 days (IQR 7-14 day). There were no 
significant differences between the intervention and the control groups in 
postoperative LOS (p = 0.99) or global HRQoL after one year (women: p = 0.54, 
men: p = 0.94). While overall complications and major complications occurred in 
74% and 24% of the cases, respectively, frequency and severity of complications 
did not differ significantly between the groups. Patients in the intervention 
group reported significantly less postoperative pain (p = 0.03) than the control 
group. Independent predictors for LOS were identified as severity of surgery, 
length of anesthesia, major postoperative complications, nutritional state, and 
pre-operative physical functional capacity measured by the Timed Up and Go-test 
by multiple robust regressions.
CONCLUSION: Patient empowerment through information booklet and diary keeping 
did not shorten the postoperative LOS in elderly onco-surgical patients, but 
improved quality of care regarding postoperative pain. Postoperative length of 
stay is influenced by pre-operative nutritional state, pre-operative functional 
impairment, severity of surgery, and length of anesthesia.

The primary outcome were 1,postoperative length of hospital stay (LOS) and 2. long-term global health-related quality of life (HRQoL) one year postoperatively. HRQoL was assessed using the EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire. Secondary outcomes encompassed postoperative stress and complications. Further objectives were the identification of predictors of LOS, and HRQoL at 12 months.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
Overall 652 patients were included. The mean age was 72 ¬± 4.9 years, and the majority of patients were male (68.6%, n = 447). The ^median of postoperative length of stay was 9 days (IQR 7‚Äì14 day). There were no significant differences between the intervention and the control groups in postoperative LOS (p = 0.99) or global HRQoL after one year (women: p = 0.54, men: p = 0.94). While overall complications and major complications occurred in 74% and 24% of the cases, respectively, frequency and severity of complications did not differ significantly between the groups. Patients in the intervention group reported significantly less postoperative pain (p = 0.03) than the control group. Independent predictors for LOS were identified as severity of surgery, length of anesthesia, major postoperative complications, nutritional state, and pre-operative physical functional capacity measured by the Timed Up and Go-test by multiple robust regressions.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.
Patient empowerment through information booklet and diary keeping did not shorten the postoperative LOS in elderly onco-surgical patients, but improved quality of care regarding postoperative pain. Postoperative length of stay is influenced by pre-operative nutritional state, pre-operative functional impairment, severity of surgery, and length of anesthesia.

BACKGROUND: Alirocumab undergoes target-mediated clearance via binding of 
proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Statins increase PCSK9 
levels; the effects of nonstatin lipid-lowering therapies are unclear. 
Every-4-weeks dosing of alirocumab may be appropriate for some patients in 
absence of background statin but is not yet approved.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), PCSK9, and 
alirocumab levels were assessed in subjects (LDL-C >130 mg/dL, n=24/group) after 
a 4-week run-in taking oral ezetimibe, fenofibrate, or ezetimibe placebo, when 
alirocumab 150 mg every 4 weeks (days 1, 29, and 57) was added. Maximal mean 
LDL-C reductions from day -1 baseline (prealirocumab) occurred on day 71 in all 
groups: alirocumab plus placebo, 47.4%; alirocumab plus ezetimibe, 56.6%; and 
alirocumab plus fenofibrate, 54.3%. LDL-C reductions were sustained through day 
85 with alirocumab plus placebo (47.0%); the duration of effect was slightly 
diminished at day 85 versus day 71 with ezetimibe (49.6%) or fenofibrate 
combinations (43.2%). Free PCSK9 concentrations were lowest at day 71 in all 
groups, then increased over time; by day 85, free PCSK9 concentrations were 
higher, and alirocumab levels lower, with alirocumab plus fenofibrate, and to a 
lesser extent alirocumab plus ezetimibe, versus alirocumab plus placebo.
CONCLUSIONS: Alirocumab 150 mg every 4 weeks produced maximal LDL-C reductions 
of 47% in combination with placebo and 54% to 57% in combination with ezetimibe 
or fenofibrate. The oral lipid-lowering therapies appear to increase PCSK9 
levels, leading to increased alirocumab clearance. Although the duration of 
effect was modestly diminished with alirocumab plus ezetimibe/fenofibrate versus 
placebo, the effect was less than observed in trials with background statins, 
and it would not preclude the use of alirocumab every 4 weeks in patients taking 
these nonstatin lipid-lowering therapies concomitantly.

BACKGROUND: Programmes based on the World Health Organization's Health Promoting 
Schools framework (HPS) have been implemented in several countries but for 
evidence-based policy-making more research is required to determine the 
effectiveness of the HPS approach.
METHODS: We conducted a cluster randomised controlled trial. The units of 
randomisation were primary school classes recruited in May 2010. Eligible 
participants were Year 3 primary school classes in Lower Austria that had not 
participated in a similar programme during the last two years. After baseline 
assessment in September 2010, 53 classes from 45 primary schools in Lower 
Austria were randomly assigned to an intervention (n = 26 classes, 432 children) 
or waiting control arm (n = 27 classes, 493 children aged 8.7 years +/- 
4 months). Over the course of 1.5 academic years, participating teachers 
received on-the-job training (20 h) and two workshops (8 h) to promote health 
related behaviour in students such as physical activity during the school day 
and to improve the quality of regular physical education classes. We assessed 15 
outcomes grouped into five categories: Emotional and Social Experience in 
School, Physical Activity, Well-being, and Attention Performance measured by 
validated and standardised questionnaire and Motor Skills measured by validated 
and standardised motoric and coordination tests in the school gym. The primary 
outcome was Classroom Climate and part of the outcomecategory Emotional and 
Social Experience in School. The final assessment took place in April 2012. All 
assessors were blinded to the allocation of classes. Multilevel growth modelling 
was used to investigate programme effectiveness.
RESULTS: We could not detect any statistically significant differences between 
groups for the outcomecategories Emotional and Social Experience in school 
(p = 0.22 to 0.78), Physical Activity, Well-being, and Attention Performance. 
Significant differences between groups were limited to the outcomecategory Motor 
Skills (Complex Reaction Ability, Spatial Orientation Skills, Coordination with 
Precision) which were higher in the intervention group (P < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite small statistically significant differences in Motor 
Skills, our study could not detect any clinically relevant improvements in the 
Emotional and Social Experience at School (including the primary outcome 
ClassroomClimate), Physical Activity, Well-being, Motor Skills and Attention 
Performance of students.

This study investigates the relationship between intraocular pressure (IOP), 
optical coherence tomography (OCT) parameters, and visual field (VF) outcomes in 
'Green' patients-those with normal OCT findings but potential VF abnormalities. 
Understanding this relationship is crucial for improving early detection and 
management strategies for glaucoma, especially in patients who show functional 
loss despite normal structural findings on OCT. A cross-sectional study was 
conducted at Taipei City Hospital, Renai Branch, Taiwan, from July 1, 2015, to 
July 1, 2023. Participants were referred for suspected glaucoma and included 
based on normal OCT parameters ('green' coding) and completed VF tests. Patients 
with any ocular disease that could confound results were excluded. Logistic 
regression models were used to assess relationships between IOP, OCT parameters 
(rim area, disc area, retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, cup-to-disc ratios, 
and cup volume), and VF outcomes. Age, sex, and IOP status (normal or ocular 
hypertension) were also included in the analysis. All data were analyzed using 
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 23.0. Larger disc area was a 
significant predictor of VF abnormalities, with an adjusted OR of 3.72 (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 1.14-12.15). Neither normal IOP nor ocular 
hypertension significantly predicted VF loss (adjusted OR = 0.89; 95% CI, 
0.27-2.96). Female sex was associated with a higher likelihood of VF 
abnormalities (adjusted OR = 5.68; 95% CI, 1.03-31.25). Other OCT parameters, 
including retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and cup-to-disc ratios, were not 
significantly associated with VF outcomes. Disc area plays a critical role in 
predicting VF abnormalities in ""green"" patients, suggesting the importance of 
integrating disc size into screening and monitoring protocols. These findings 
challenge the reliance on IOP alone for predicting VF loss and support the need 
for more comprehensive assessments. Future research should explore longitudinal 
studies to further assess the predictive value of disc area and investigate 
additional factors, such as vascular and biomechanical influences, that may 
contribute to VF deterioration in this population.

Patients with glaucoma who do not keep their follow-up eye care appointments are at risk for developing more severe ocular disease. The primary aim of the current study was to evaluate whether the use of a patient navigator altered adherence to follow-up eye care appointments in community-versus office-based settings.

ABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS.
Patients diagnosed with a glaucoma-related condition following a comprehensive eye examination at 43 community sites in Philadelphia, PA, USA, were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Patients were randomized into three groups for a 1-year period: Group 1 (G1) received follow-up eye care in a community-based setting with assistance from a patient navigator; Group 2 (G2) received follow-up eye care in an office-based setting with assistance from a patient navigator; and Group 3 (G3) received follow-up eye care in an office-based setting without a patient navigator (usual care). Adherence rates were compared among these three groups using a chi-squared test at a significance level of 0.05.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
A total of 155 patients with glaucoma-related diagnoses were enrolled. The mean age (¬±standard deviation) was 71.2 (¬±10.0) years. Patients were predominantly female (65.8%, n=102/155) and African-American (71.6%, n=111/155). The mean (¬±standard deviation) number of follow-up visits during the 1-year study period was 1.3 (¬±1.3) for G1, 1.6 (¬±1.3) for G2, and 1.3 (¬±1.1) for G3 (P=0.48). Appointment adherence, defined as attendance of ‚â•1 follow-up visit, was 69.8% (n=37/53) for G1, 82.5% (n=47/57) for G2, and 73.3% (n=33/45) for G3, (P=0.28). Sub-analysis of adherence rates for patients who attended ‚â•2 follow-up visits were 91.3% (n=21/23) for G1, 74.3% (n=26/35) for G2, and 66.7% (n=18/27) for G3, (P=0.11).

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.
Help from a patient navigator did not increase the likelihood of keeping ‚â•1 follow-up appointment in an office-based setting. Adherence rates for follow-up appointments reached close to 70% or above in a self-selected patient population.",FALSE,27660423

BACKGROUND: Dexmedetomidine, a selective alpha-2 agonist, has sedative, 
analgesic, and anxiolytic effects without respiratory depression. 
Dexmedetomidine can cause a biphasic cardiovascular response, and induce 
transient hypertension. Hypotension is a common complication of spinal 
anesthesia. Decreasing anxiety of patients before procedure is important for 
high quality of procedure. This study aimed to compare the incidence of 
hypotension and patients' anxiety and comfort levels when dexmedetomidine was 
intravenously administered before and after spinal anesthesia.
METHODS: Seventy-four patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists 
physical status classification I or II were randomly allocated into two groups. 
Spinal anesthesia was performed using 12 mg of 0.5% heavy bupivacaine. In Group 
A, 1 μg/kg of dexmedetomidine was intravenously administered for 10 min, 
followed by the maintenance infusion of dexmedetomidine 0.2 μg/kg/hr after 5 min 
of intrathecal bupivacaine injection. Patients in Group B received same dose of 
dexmedetomidine by intravenous administration before 5 min of intrathecal 
bupivacaine injection. Perioperative vital signs, anxiety (using the 
Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and comfort (using the numerical 
rating scale) were evaluated.
RESULTS: The incidence of hypotension was significantly lower in Group A (16.1%) 
than in Group B (48.4%) during infusion of dexmedetomidine (p = 0.01). The need 
for treatment of hypotension is higher in Group B than Group A (p = 0.02). The 
incidence of bradycardia and desaturation did not significantly differ between 
the two groups. There were no statistically significant differences regarding 
the patients' anxiety and comfort.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypotension is more frequently occurred, and the treatment of 
hypotension is more needed in Group B. The intravenously administration of 
dexmedetomidine before spinal anesthesia has no advantages in hemodynamic status 
and patients' comfort compared to that after spinal anesthesia during lower limb 
surgery.

BACKGROUND: Maintenance monotherapy with the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 
inhibitor olaparib significantly prolongs progression-free survival over placebo 
in patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed serous ovarian cancer, with 
greatest benefit seen in patients with a BRCA1/2 mutation (BRCAm). Preservation 
of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is important during maintenance 
therapy; we evaluated the effect of olaparib on HRQoL in this Phase II trial 
(NCT00753545, Study 19).
METHODS: Patients received olaparib 400 mg b.i.d. (capsules) or placebo until 
progression. Patient-reported HRQoL and disease-related symptoms were evaluated 
using the FACT-Ovarian (FACT-O) questionnaire (completed at baseline and every 
28 days until progression), the FACT/NCCN Ovarian Symptom Index (FOSI) and the 
Trial Outcome Index (TOI). TOI of the FACT-O was the primary measure.
RESULTS: Overall, 265 women were randomised to maintenance olaparib (n=136) or 
placebo (n=129). Compliance for HRQoL assessment was high (∼80% over time). Most 
patients in both arms reported a best response of 'no change' on TOI (81%) and 
other HRQoL measures. There were no statistically significant differences in 
time to worsening or improvement rates of TOI, FOSI and FACT-O scores in the 
overall, BRCAm and germline BRCAm populations.
CONCLUSIONS: Maintenance treatment with olaparib was well tolerated and had no 
adverse impact on HRQoL in this study of patients with platinum-sensitive 
relapsed serous ovarian cancer who had responded to their most recent 
platinum-based therapy (partial or complete response). Interpretation of the 
HRQoL results in this population may differ from patients who have not responded 
to their most recent platinum-based therapy.

Maintenance monotherapy with the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor olaparib significantly prolongs progression-free survival over placebo in patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed serous ovarian cancer, with greatest benefit seen in patients with a BRCA1/2 mutation (BRCAm). Preservation of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is important during maintenance therapy; we evaluated the effect of olaparib on HRQoL in this Phase II trial (NCT00753545, Study 19).

ABSTRACT.METHODS:.
Patients received olaparib 400 mg b.i.d. (capsules) or placebo until progression. Patient-reported HRQoL and disease-related symptoms were evaluated using the FACT-Ovarian (FACT-O) questionnaire (completed at baseline and every 28 days until progression), the FACT/NCCN Ovarian Symptom Index (FOSI) and the Trial Outcome Index (TOI). TOI of the FACT-O was the primary measure.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.
Overall, 265 women were randomised to maintenance olaparib (n=136) or placebo (n=129). Compliance for HRQoL assessment was high (‚àº80% over time). Most patients in both arms reported a best response of 'no change' on TOI (81%) and other HRQoL measures. There were no statistically significant differences in time to worsening or improvement rates of TOI, FOSI and FACT-O scores in the overall, BRCAm and germline BRCAm populations.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:.
Maintenance treatment with olaparib was well tolerated and had no adverse impact on HRQoL in this study of patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed serous ovarian cancer who had responded to their most recent platinum-based therapy (partial or complete response). Interpretation of the HRQoL results in this population may differ from patients who have not responded to their most recent platinum-based therapy.",TRUE,

Pain and urinary symptoms following colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery are frequent 
and carry a poor recovery. This study tested the effects of inhalation of 
Lavandula angustifolia Mill. (lavender) oil or linalyl acetate on pain relief 
and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) following the removal of indwelling 
urinary catheters from patients after CRC surgery. This randomised control study 
recruited 66 subjects with indwelling urinary catheters after undergoing CRC 
surgery who later underwent catheter removal. Patients inhaled 1% lavender, 1% 
linalyl acetate, or vehicle (control group) for 20 minutes. Systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure (BP), heart rate, LUTS, and visual analog scales of 
pain magnitude and quality of life (QoL) regarding urinary symptoms were 
measured before and after inhalation. Systolic BP, diastolic BP, heart rate, 
LUTS, and QoL satisfaction with urinary symptoms were similar in the three 
groups. Significant differences in pain magnitude and urinary residual sense of 
indwelling catheters were observed among the three groups, with inhalation of 
linalyl acetate being significantly more effective than inhalation of lavender 
or vehicle. Inhalation of linalyl acetate is an effective nursing intervention 
to relieve pain and urinary residual sense of indwelling urinary catheters 
following their removal from patients who underwent CRC surgery.

BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) prevents chronic diseases. Self-determination 
theory (SDT) provides a useful framework to understand the nature of 
motivational interviewing (MI).
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the effect of MI-based intervention 
using SDT on the promotion of PA among women in reproductive age.
METHODS: Seventy women in reproductive age were selected by clustering sampling 
method for this randomized controlled trial. The questionnaire included the 
variables of physical fitness test, SDT, and global physical activity 
questionnaire (GPAQ). The validity of the questionnaires was approved using 
content validity ratio (CVR) and index (CVI). The reliability and internal 
consistency of the questionnaires and measures was approved using test-retest 
method and Cronbach's alpha test, respectively. The intervention group (n=35) 
received four MI sessions through theory and one standard education session 
about PA. The control group (n=35) received a standard education session about 
PA.
RESULTS: Four months after the intervention, an increase in the mean scores of 
total PA (p<0.001, ES=4.77), physical fitness tests including flexibility 
(p<0.001, ES=1.59), muscular endurance (p<0.001, ES=2.0), cardiorespiratory 
endurance (p<0.001, ES=0.51), and a decrease in mean scores of agility test 
(p<0.001, ES= - 0.51) and sedentary behavior (p<0.01, ES=- 0.74) was observed in 
the intervention group compared to the control group. The intervention group 
reported an increase in the scores of intrinsic motivation (p<0.001, ES=3.34), 
identified regulation (p<0.001, ES= 1.28), perceptions of competence (p<0.001, 
ES=0.81) and autonomy (p<0.001, ES=2.01), enjoyment (p<0.001, ES=0.98) and 
health motives (p<0.01, ES=0.19), health care climate (p<0.001, ES=4.6), and a 
decreased score of external regulation (p<0.01, ES=-0.55) and amotivation 
(p<0.01, ES= -0.56) over time, compared to the control group.
CONCLUSION: MI-based intervention using SDT was effective on the promotion of 
PA.

BACKGROUND: Cholecystectomy can be associated with considerable postoperative 
pain. While the benefits of paravertebral block (PVB) on pain after thoracotomy 
and mastectomy have been demonstrated, not enough investigations on the effects 
of PVB on pain after open cholecystectomy have been conducted. We tested the 
hypothesis that a single-injection thoracic PVB reduces pain scores, decreases 
opioid consumption, and prolongs analgesic request time after cholecystectomy.
METHODS: Of 52 patients recruited, 50 completed the study. They were randomly 
allocated into two groups: the paravertebral group and the control group. The 
outcome measures were the severity of pain measured on numeric pain rating 
scale, total opioid consumption, and first analgesic request time during the 
first postoperative 24 hours.
RESULT: The main outcomes recorded during 24 hours after surgery were Numerical 
Rating Scale (NRS) pain scores (NRS, 0-10), cumulative opioid consumption, and 
the first analgesic request time. Twenty four hours after surgery, NRS at rest 
was 4 (3-6) vs 5 (5-7) and at movement 4 (4-7) vs 6 (5-7.5) for the PVB and 
control groups, respectively. The difference between the groups over the whole 
observation period was statistically significant (P<0.05). Twenty-four hours 
after surgery, median (25th-75th percentile) cumulative morphine consumption was 
0 (0-2) vs 2.5 (2-4) mg (P<0.0001) and cumulative tramadol consumption was 200 
(150-250) mg vs 300 (200-350) mg in the paravertebral and in the control group, 
respectively (P=0.003). After surgery, the median (25th-75th percentile) first 
analgesic requirement time was prolonged in the PVB group in statistically 
significant fashion (P<0.0001).
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Single-shot thoracic PVB as a component of 
multi-modal analgesic regimen provided superior analgesia when compared with the 
control group up to 24 postoperative hours after cholecystectomy, and we 
recommend this block for post cholecystectomy pain relief.

BACKGROUND: Long-term treatment with riociguat has been shown to enhance 
exercise capacity in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and 
inoperable or persistent/recurrent chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension 
(CTEPH). This study sought to evaluate the long-term haemodynamic effects of 
riociguat in patients with PAH and inoperable CTEPH.
METHODS: During this single-centre long-term observational study, riociguat was 
administered at a three-times-daily dose of up to 2.5 mg. The primary outcome 
was pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). The secondary outcomes included mean 
pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), cardiac index, mortality, clinical worsening 
events, 6-min walk distance (6MWD) and World Health Organization functional 
class (WHO FC).
RESULTS: 37 patients (CTEPH n=19; PAH n=18) were included. The median follow-up 
period was 96 months. The survival estimates for all the patients at 
1/3/5/8 years were 0.97/0.86/0.72/0.61, without significant differences between 
patients with CTEPH and PAH. At the final data cut-off, PVR decreased 
(1232±462 dyn·s·cm-5 versus 835±348 dyn·s·cm-5, p<0.001), cardiac index 
increased (1.7±0.4 L·min-1·m-2 versus 2.4±0.5 L·min-1·m-2, p<0.001), 6MWD 
increased by 43.1±59.6 m, and WHO FC improved/stabilised/worsened in 40%/35%/25% 
of patients versus baseline. Improvement in PAP was not shown. Compared with 
patients in WHO FC I/II and III/IV at baseline, the 8-year clinical 
worsening-free survival estimates were 0.51 versus 0.19 (p=0.026).
CONCLUSIONS: Riociguat improved PVR and cardiac index for up to 8 years, but not 
PAP. WHO FC may have certain predictive value for the long-term prognosis.

We compared the haemodynamic effects of riociguat in patients with inoperable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) or persistent/recurrent CTEPH after pulmonary endarterectomy in the Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension Soluble Guanylate Cyclase‚ÄìStimulator Trial 1 study.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
Patients with inoperable or persistent/recurrent CTEPH (n=261; mean¬± SD age 59¬±14 years; 66% women) were randomised to riociguat (up to 2.5 mg three times daily) or placebo. Haemodynamic parameters were assessed at baseline and week 16.

BACKGROUND: Psychostimulants are considered first-line pharmacotherapy for youth 
with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but questions remain 
regarding the comparative efficacy of amphetamine- and methylphenidate-based 
agents.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to describe two acute randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, head-to-head studies of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) 
and osmotic-release oral system methylphenidate (OROS-MPH) in adolescents with 
ADHD.
METHODS: Adolescents (13-17 years) diagnosed with ADHD according to Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision 
(DSM-IV-TR) criteria were enrolled in an 8-week flexible-dose study [LDX 
30-70 mg/day (n = 186 randomized); OROS-MPH 18-72 mg/day (n = 185 randomized); 
placebo (n = 93 randomized)] or a 6-week forced-dose study [LDX 70 mg/day 
(n = 219 randomized); OROS-MPH 72 mg/day (n = 220 randomized); placebo (n = 110 
randomized)]. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale IV 
(ADHD-RS-IV) total score changes from baseline (primary endpoint) at week 8 
(flexible-dose study) or week 6 (forced-dose study) were assessed with 
mixed-effects models for repeated measures. Secondary endpoints included 
improvement on the dichotomized Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale 
(CGI-I; key secondary endpoint) and changes from baseline on the ADHD-RS-IV 
subscales. Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
and vital signs.
RESULTS: Least squares (LS) mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) ADHD-RS-IV 
total score changes from baseline to end of treatment were -17.0 ± 1.03 with 
placebo, -25.4 ± 0.74 with LDX, and -22.1 ± 0.73 with OROS-MPH in the 
forced-dose study and -13.4 ± 1.19 with placebo, -25.6 ± 0.82 with LDX, and 
-23.5 ± 0.80 with OROS-MPH in the flexible-dose study. LS mean ± SEM treatment 
difference for the change from baseline significantly favored LDX over OROS-MPH 
in the forced-dose [-3.4 ± 1.04, p = 0.0013, effect size (ES) -0.33] but not the 
flexible-dose (-2.1 ± 1.15, p = 0.0717, ES -0.20) study. The percentage of 
improved participants on the dichotomized CGI-I at end of treatment was 
significantly greater with LDX than with OROS-MPH in the forced-dose study (81.4 
vs. 71.3%, p = 0.0188) but not the flexible-dose study (LDX 83.1%, OROS-MPH 
81.0%, p = 0.6165). The LS mean ± SEM treatment differences for change from 
baseline on the ADHD-RS-IV hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattentiveness 
subscales nominally favored LDX in the forced-dose study 
(hyperactivity/impulsivity subscale -1.3 ± 0.49, nominal p = 0.0081, ES -0.27; 
inattentiveness subscale -2.0 ± 0.63, nominal p = 0.0013, ES -0.33), but there 
were no significant differences between active treatments in the flexible-dose 
study. In both studies, LDX and OROS-MPH were superior to placebo for all 
efficacy-related endpoints (all nominal p < 0.0001; ES range -0.43 to -1.16). 
The overall frequency of TEAEs for LDX and OROS-MPH, respectively, were 66.5 and 
58.9% in the forced-dose study and 83.2 and 82.1% in the flexible-dose study. 
TEAEs occurring in ≥ 5% of participants that were also reported at two or more 
times the rate of placebo were decreased appetite, decreased weight, insomnia, 
initial insomnia, dry mouth, and nasopharyngitis (LDX and OROS-MPH), 
irritability and dizziness (LDX only), and increased heart rate (OROS-MPH only) 
in the forced-dose study and decreased appetite, decreased weight, insomnia, and 
dizziness (LDX and OROS-MPH) and dry mouth and upper abdominal pain (LDX only) 
in the flexible-dose study. Mean ± standard deviation (SD) increases from 
baseline in vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse) were 
observed in the forced-dose study [LDX 1.6 ± 9.65 and 3.3 ± 8.11 mmHg, 
6.7 ± 12.78 beats per minute (bpm); OROS-MPH 2.6 ± 10.15 and 3.3 ± 9.13 mmHg, 
7.6 ± 12.47 bpm] and the flexible-dose study (LDX 2.4 ± 9.46 and 
2.8 ± 8.41 mmHg, 4.7 ± 11.82 bpm; OROS-MPH 0.4 ± 9.90 and 2.2 ± 8.64 mmHg, 
6.0 ± 10.52 bpm) at the last on-treatment assessment.
CONCLUSIONS: LDX was superior to OROS-MPH in adolescents with ADHD in the 
forced-dose but not the flexible-dose study. Safety and tolerability for both 
medications was consistent with previous studies. These findings underscore the 
robust acute efficacy of both psychostimulant classes in treating adolescents

Psychostimulants are considered first-line pharmacotherapy for youth with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but questions remain regarding the comparative efficacy of amphetamine- and methylphenidate-based agents.

ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE.
Our objective was to describe two acute randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, head-to-head studies of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) and osmotic-release oral system methylphenidate (OROS-MPH) in adolescents with ADHD.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
Adolescents (13‚Äì17 years) diagnosed with ADHD according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria were enrolled in an 8-week flexible-dose study [LDX 30‚Äì70 mg/day (n = 186 randomized); OROS-MPH 18‚Äì72 mg/day (n = 185 randomized); placebo (n = 93 randomized)] or a 6-week forced-dose study [LDX 70 mg/day (n = 219 randomized); OROS-MPH 72 mg/day (n = 220 randomized); placebo (n = 110 randomized)]. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS-IV) total score changes from baseline (primary endpoint) at week 8 (flexible-dose study) or week 6 (forced-dose study) were assessed with mixed-effects models for repeated measures. Secondary endpoints included improvement on the dichotomized Clinical Global Impressions‚ÄìImprovement scale (CGI-I; key secondary endpoint) and changes from baseline on the ADHD-RS-IV subscales. Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and vital signs.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
Least squares (LS) mean ¬± standard error of the mean (SEM) ADHD-RS-IV total score changes from baseline to end of treatment were ‚àí17.0 ¬± 1.03 with placebo, ‚àí25.4 ¬± 0.74 with LDX, and ‚àí22.1 ¬± 0.73 with OROS-MPH in the forced-dose study and ‚àí13.4 ¬± 1.19 with placebo, ‚àí25.6 ¬± 0.82 with LDX, and ‚àí23.5 ¬± 0.80 with OROS-MPH in the flexible-dose study. LS mean ¬± SEM treatment difference for the change from baseline significantly favored LDX over OROS-MPH in the forced-dose [‚àí3.4 ¬± 1.04, p = 0.0013, effect size (ES) ‚àí0.33] but not the flexible-dose (‚àí2.1 ¬± 1.15, p = 0.0717, ES ‚àí0.20) study. The percentage of improved participants on the dichotomized CGI-I at end of treatment was significantly greater with LDX than with OROS-MPH in the forced-dose study (81.4 vs. 71.3%, p = 0.0188) but not the flexible-dose study (LDX 83.1%, OROS-MPH 81.0%, p = 0.6165). The LS mean ¬± SEM treatment differences for change from baseline on the ADHD-RS-IV hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattentiveness subscales nominally favored LDX in the forced-dose study (hyperactivity/impulsivity subscale ‚àí1.3 ¬± 0.49, nominal p = 0.0081, ES ‚àí0.27; inattentiveness subscale ‚àí2.0 ¬± 0.63, nominal p = 0.0013, ES ‚àí0.33), but there were no significant differences between active treatments in the flexible-dose study. In both studies, LDX and OROS-MPH were superior to placebo for all efficacy-related endpoints (all nominal p &lt; 0.0001; ES range ‚àí0.43 to ‚àí1.16). The overall frequency of TEAEs for LDX and OROS-MPH, respectively, were 66.5 and 58.9% in the forced-dose study and 83.2 and 82.1% in the flexible-dose study. TEAEs occurring in ‚â• 5% of participants that were also reported at two or more times the rate of placebo were decreased appetite, decreased weight, insomnia, initial insomnia, dry mouth, and nasopharyngitis (LDX and OROS-MPH), irritability and dizziness (LDX only), and increased heart rate (OROS-MPH only) in the forced-dose study and decreased appetite, decreased weight, insomnia, and dizziness (LDX and OROS-MPH) and dry mouth and upper abdominal pain (LDX only) in the flexible-dose study. Mean ¬± standard deviation (SD) increases from baseline in vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse) were observed in the forced-dose study [LDX 1.6 ¬± 9.65 and 3.3 ¬± 8.11 mmHg, 6.7 ¬± 12.78 beats per minute (bpm); OROS-MPH 2.6 ¬± 10.15 and 3.3 ¬± 9.13 mmHg, 7.6 ¬± 12.47 bpm] and the flexible-dose study (LDX 2.4 ¬± 9.46 and 2.8 ¬± 8.41 mmHg, 4.7 ¬± 11.82 bpm; OROS-MPH 0.4 ¬± 9.90 and 2.2 ¬± 8.64 mmHg, 6.0 ¬± 10.52 bpm) at the last on-treatment assessment.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
LDX was superior to OROS-MPH in adolescents with ADHD in the forced-dose but not the flexible-dose study. Safety and tolerability for both medications was consistent with previous studies. These findings underscore the robust acute efficacy of both psychostimulant classes in treating adolescents with ADHD.

BACKGROUND: Many drug users present to primary care requesting detoxification 
from illicit opiates. There are a number of detoxification agents but no 
recommended drug of choice. The purpose of this study is to compare 
buprenorphine with dihydrocodeine for detoxification from illicit opiates in 
primary care.
METHODS: Open label randomised controlled trial in NHS Primary Care (General 
Practices), Leeds, UK. Sixty consenting adults using illicit opiates received 
either daily sublingual buprenorphine or daily oral dihydrocodeine. Reducing 
regimens for both interventions were at the discretion of prescribing doctor 
within a standard regimen of not more than 15 days. Primary outcome was 
abstinence from illicit opiates at final prescription as indicated by a urine 
sample. Secondary outcomes during detoxification period and at three and six 
months post detoxification were recorded.
RESULTS: Only 23% completed the prescribed course of detoxification medication 
and gave a urine sample on collection of their final prescription. Risk of 
non-completion of detoxification was reduced if allocated buprenorphine (68% vs 
88%, RR 0.58 CI 0.35-0.96, p = 0.065). A higher proportion of people allocated 
to buprenorphine provided a clean urine sample compared with those who received 
dihydrocodeine (21% vs 3%, RR 2.06 CI 1.33-3.21, p = 0.028). People allocated to 
buprenorphine had fewer visits to professional carers during detoxification and 
more were abstinent at three months (10 vs 4, RR 1.55 CI 0.96-2.52) and six 
months post detoxification (7 vs 3, RR 1.45 CI 0.84-2.49).
CONCLUSION: Informative randomised trials evaluating routine care within the 
primary care setting are possible amongst drug using populations. This small 
study generates unique data on commonly used treatment regimens.

There continues to be a need for improved medical management of diabetes 
patients with hypertension in primary care. While several care models have shown 
effectiveness in achieving various outcomes among these patients, it remains 
unclear what care model is most effective in improving blood pressure control in 
primary care. In this prospective study, 54 patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus and blood pressure of >140/90 identified through the registry, were 
randomized into three groups. Group A attended a nurse educator-conducted class 
on diabetes and hypertension, group B attended the same class and was asked to 
monitor their home blood pressure using provided device, and group C served as 
control (usual care). Of the 24 subjects who completed the study, only 20% 
achieved the target blood pressure of <130/80 and there was no statistical 
difference in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures among the three groups 
(p > 0.05). Efforts to intensify management of hypertension among type 2 
diabetes patients did not result in better blood pressure control compared to 
usual care. Studies looking into factors which limit patients' participation in 
group classes and determining patients' preferences in disease management would 
be helpful in ensuring success of any chronic disease management program.

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that replacement of sucrose with isomaltulose 
in sweet foods and beverages improves metabolic control in patients with type 2 
diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred ten patients with type 2 diabetes were 
randomized to receive sweet foods containing either 50 g/day isomaltulose or 
sucrose for 12 weeks as part of their habitual diet under free-living 
conditions. HbA(1c) at 12 weeks was the primary outcome parameter.
RESULTS: In the final analysis comprising 101 patients, isomaltulose did not 
significantly affect HbA(1c) at 12 weeks (sucrose: 7.39 ± 0.78%; isomaltulose: 
7.24 ± 0.76%; regression coefficient [b]: 0.02 [95% CI: -0.21 to 0.25], P = 
0.844). Triglycerides at 12 weeks were significantly lower in the isomaltulose 
versus the sucrose group (b: 34.01 [6.59-61.44], P = 0.016). Other secondary 
parameters did not significantly differ between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Isomaltulose did not influence glycemic control assessed as HbA(1c) 
in type 2 diabetes under free-living conditions but was associated with lower 
triglyceride levels.

This study is a randomized prospective study comparing two fracture fixation 
implants, the extramedullary sliding hip screw (SHS) and the dual lag screw 
cephalomedullary nail, in the treatment of intertrochanteric femoral fractures 
in the elderly. One hundred and sixty-five patients with low-energy 
intertrochanteric fractures, classified as AO/OTA 31A, were prospectively 
included during a 2-year period (2005-2006). Patients were randomized into two 
groups: group A included 79 hip fractures managed with sliding hip screws and 
group B included 86 fractures treated with cephalomedullary nails. Delay to 
surgery, duration of surgery, time of fluoroscopy, total hospital stay, 
implant-related complications, transfusion requirements, re-operation details, 
functional recovery, and mortality were recorded. The mean follow-up was 
36 months (24-56 months). The mean surgical time was statistically significantly 
shorter and fluoroscopy time longer for the group B. No intraoperative femoral 
shaft fractures occurred. There was no statistically significant difference in 
the functional recovery score, reoperation, and mortality rates between the 2 
groups. A new type of complication, the so-called Z-effect phenomenon, was 
noticed in the cephalomedullary nail group. There are no statistically 
significant differences between the two techniques in terms of type and rate of 
complications, functional outcome, reoperation and mortality rates when 
comparing the SHS and the cephalomedullary nail for low-energy AO/OTA 31A 
intertrochanteric fractures. Our data do not support recommendations for the use 
of one implant over the other.

INTRODUCTION: In a previous pooled analysis of 19 double-blind clinical studies 
conducted by Merck, which included data available as of July 2009 on 10,246 
patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), treatment with sitagliptin was shown to be 
generally well tolerated compared with treatment with control agents. As the 
sitagliptin clinical development program continues, additional studies with 
sitagliptin have been completed. The present analysis updates the safety and 
tolerability assessment of sitagliptin by examining pooled data from 25 
double-blind clinical studies.
METHODS: The present analysis included data from 14,611 patients in 25 studies 
with T2DM who received either sitagliptin 100 mg/day (n = 7,726; sitagliptin 
group) or a comparator agent (n = 6,885; non-exposed group). These studies 
represent all randomized, double-blind trials conducted by Merck that included 
patients treated with the usual clinical dose of sitagliptin (100 mg/day) for 
between 12 weeks and 2 years, and for which results were available as of 
December 2011. These studies assessed sitagliptin, versus comparator agents, 
taken as monotherapy, initial combination therapy with metformin or 
pioglitazone, or as add-on combination therapy with other antihyperglycemic 
agents (metformin, pioglitazone, a sulfonylurea ± metformin, 
insulin ± metformin, or metformin + pioglitazone or rosiglitazone). 
Patient-level data from each study were used to evaluate between-group 
differences in the exposure-adjusted incidence rates of adverse events (AEs).
RESULTS: Overall incidence rates of AEs and drug-related AEs were higher in the 
non-exposed group compared with the sitagliptin group. Incidence rates of 
specific AEs were generally similar between the two groups, except for higher 
incidence rates of hypoglycemia related to the greater use of a sulfonylurea and 
diarrhea related to the greater use of metformin in the non-exposed group, and 
of constipation in the sitagliptin group. Treatment with sitagliptin was not 
associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, 
malignancy, or pancreatitis.
CONCLUSION: In this updated pooled safety analysis of data from 14,611 patients 
with T2DM, sitagliptin 100 mg/day was generally well tolerated in clinical 
trials of up to 2 years in duration.

BACKGROUND: The conduct of clinical trials should be an integral part of routine 
patient care. Treating patients in trials incurs additional costs over and above 
standard of care (SOC), but the extent of the cost burden is not known. We 
undertook a retrospective cost attribution analysis to quantitate the treatment 
costs associated with cancer clinical trial protocols conducted over a 2 year 
period.
METHODS: All patients entered into oncology (non-haematology) clinical trials 
involving investigational medicinal products in 2009 and 2010 in a single UK 
institution were identified. The trial protocols on which they were treated were 
analysed to identify the treatment costs for the experimental arm(s) of the 
trial and the equivalent SOC had the patient not been entered in the trial. The 
treatment cost difference was calculated by subtracting the experimental 
treatment cost from SOC cost. For randomised trials, an average treatment cost 
was estimated by taking into account the number of arms and randomisation ratio. 
An estimate of the annual treatment costs was calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 357 adult oncology patients were treated on 53 different 
trial protocols: 40 phase III, 2 randomised II/III and 11 phase II design. A 
total of 27 trials were academic, non-commercial sponsored trials and 26 were 
commercial sponsored trials. When compared with SOC, the average treatment cost 
per patient was an excess of £431 for a non-commercial trial (range £6393 excess 
to £6005 saving) and a saving of £9294 for a commercial trial (range £0 to 
£71,480). There was an overall treatment cost saving of £388,719 in 2009 and 
£496,556 in 2010, largely attributable to pharmaceutical company provision of 
free drug supplies.
CONCLUSION: On an average, non-commercial trial protocols were associated with a 
small per patient excess treatment cost, whereas commercial trials were 
associated with a substantially higher cost saving. Taking into account the 
total number of patients recruited annually, treatment of patients on clinical 
trial protocols was associated with considerable cost savings across both the 
non-commercial and commercial portfolio.

PMID: 24064969 [Indexed for MEDLINE]","ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND:.
The conduct of clinical trials should be an integral part of routine patient care. Treating patients in trials incurs additional costs over and above standard of care (SOC), but the extent of the cost burden is not known. We undertook a retrospective cost attribution analysis to quantitate the treatment costs associated with cancer clinical trial protocols conducted over a 2 year period.

ABSTRACT.METHODS:.
All patients entered into oncology (non-haematology) clinical trials involving investigational medicinal products in 2009 and 2010 in a single UK institution were identified. The trial protocols on which they were treated were analysed to identify the treatment costs for the experimental arm(s) of the trial and the equivalent SOC had the patient not been entered in the trial. The treatment cost difference was calculated by subtracting the experimental treatment cost from SOC cost. For randomised trials, an average treatment cost was estimated by taking into account the number of arms and randomisation ratio. An estimate of the annual treatment costs was calculated.

Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of mental 
clinical nursing pathways on suicidal ideation and life quality of patients with 
malignant tumors.
METHODS: Two hundred patients with malignant tumors were randomly divided into a 
study group and a control group, with 100 patients in each group. During the 
treatment, patients in the study group received mental clinical nursing pathway 
care, while those in the control group were given the usual nursing care, such 
as timely inspection, nurse's reactions to patient's behavior, and execution of 
medical orders. Thereafter, the ""self-rating idea of suicide scale"" and 
Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) were used to compare the differences in the 
suicidal ideation of patients with malignant tumors between the two groups 
before and after the treatment.
RESULTS: There were no statistical differences in the scores of despair factor, 
optimistic factor, sleep factor, and cover factor between the two groups before 
the treatment (P>0.05). After different styles of nursing, the former four 
factors of patients in the study group were significantly lower than those in 
the control group (P<0.01), while there were no significant differences in the 
score of cover factor between the two groups (P>0.05). The KPS of patients 
receiving mental clinical nursing pathway care was higher than those receiving 
usual nursing care, and there was a statistical significant difference between 
the two groups (P<0.01). Interestingly, the patients' suicidal ideation scale 
was negatively correlated with KPS (r =-0.29, P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: For individuals diagnosed with a malignant tumor, using a mental 
health clinical nursing pathway can effectively decrease the degree of suicidal 
ideation and positively impact the quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Obesity has become a great problem all over the world. We repeatedly 
screened to find an effective food to treat obesity and discovered that rosehip 
extract shows potent anti-obesity effects. Investigations in mice have 
demonstrated that rosehip extract inhibits body weight gain and decreases 
visceral fat. Thus, the present study examined the effect of rosehip extract on 
human body fat in preobese subjects.
METHODS: We conducted a 12-week, single-center, double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled study of 32 subjects who had a body mass index of ≥25 but 
<30. The subjects were assigned to two random groups, and they received one 
tablet of placebo or rosehip that contained 100 mg of rosehip extract once each 
day for 12 weeks with no dietary intervention. Abdominal fat area and body fat 
percent were measured as primary outcomes. The other outcomes were body weight 
and body mass index.
RESULTS: Abdominal total fat area, abdominal visceral fat area, body weight, and 
body mass index decreased significantly in the rosehip group at week 12 compared 
with their baseline levels (P<0.01) after receiving the rosehip tablet intake, 
and the decreases in these parameters were significantly higher when compared 
with those in the placebo group. Additionally, body fat percent tended to 
decrease compared with the placebo group and their baseline level. Moreover, the 
abdominal subcutaneous fat area was significantly lower in the rosehip group 
than in the placebo group at week 12 after the initiation of intake (P<0.05). In 
addition, there were no abnormalities, subjective symptoms, and findings that 
may indicate clinical problems during the study period.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that rosehip extract may be a good candidate 
food material for preventing obesity.

INTRODUCTION: Intensive care unit (ICU) environmental factors such as noise and 
light have been cited as important causes of sleep deprivation in critically ill 
patients. Previous studies indicated that using earplugs and eye masks can 
improve REM sleep in healthy subjects in simulated ICU environment, and improve 
sleep quality in ICU patients. This study aimed to determine the effects of 
using earplugs and eye masks with relaxing background music on sleep, melatonin 
and cortisol levels in ICU patients.
METHODS: Fifty patients who underwent a scheduled cardiac surgery and were 
expected to stay at least 2 nights in Cardiac Surgical ICU (CSICU) were 
included. They were randomized to sleep with or without earplugs and eye masks 
combined with 30-minute relaxing music during the postoperative nights in CSICU. 
Urine was analyzed for nocturnal melatonin and cortisol levels. Subjective sleep 
quality was evaluated using the Chinese version of Richards-Campbell Sleep 
Questionnaire (a visual analog scale, ranging 0-100).
RESULTS: Data from 45 patients (20 in intervention group, 25 in control group) 
were analyzed. Significant differences were found between groups in depth of 
sleep, falling asleep, awakenings, falling asleep again after awakening and 
overall sleep quality (P < 0.05). Perceived sleep quality was better in the 
intervention group. No group differences were found in urinary melatonin levels 
and cortisol levels for the night before surgery, and the first and second 
nights post-surgery (P > 0.05). The urinary melatonin levels of the first and 
second postoperative nights were significantly lower than those of the night 
before surgery (P = 0.01). The opposite pattern was seen with urinary cortisol 
levels (P = 0.00).
CONCLUSION: This combination of non-pharmacological interventions is useful for 
promoting sleep in ICU adult patients; however, any influence on nocturnal 
melatonin levels and cortisol level may have been masked by several factors such 
as the timing of surgery, medication use and individual differences. Larger 
scale studies would be needed to examine the potential influences of these 
factors on biological markers and intervention efficacy on sleep.

Different amounts of ingested alcohol can have distinct effects on the human 
body. However, there is limited research on chronic alcohol consumption with 
Helicobacter pylori infection. We sought to investigate the relationship between 
the cytokine profile, oxidative balance and H. pylori infection in subjects with 
chronic alcohol consumption. A total of 142 subjects were divided into three 
groups: 59 subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion and H. pylori infection 
(group A); 53 subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion without H. pylori 
infection (group B); and 30 control subjects (group C). The serum levels of 
CagA, interleukin (IL)-10, E-selectin, TNF-α, malondialdehyde (MDA) and 
superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA). We found that the ages and serum H. pylori CagA levels among the 
three groups, as well as both the mean drinking age and the mean daily alcohol 
consumption between groups A and B, were matched and comparable. Comparing the 
BMIs among the three groups, the BMI differences were found to be statistically 
significant (F=3.921, P<0.05). Compared with group C, the BMIs in groups A and B 
were significantly higher (P<0.001 and P<0.01, respectively); however, the BMI 
differences between group A and group B were not statistically significant 
(P>0.05). Additionally, no differences in the serum CagA levels were found in 
comparisons among the groups (all P>0.05). The serum IL-10 and E-selectin levels 
in group A were significantly lower than those in group B (serum IL-10: P<0.05; 
E-selectin: P<0.05). The serum IL-10 in group A was significantly higher than 
that in group C (P<0.01); the serum E-selectin levels in group A did not 
significantly differ compared with those in group C (P>0.05). Furthermore, the 
serum IL-10 and E-selectin levels in group B were significantly higher than 
those in group C (serum IL-10: P<0.001; E-selectin: P<0.05); however, the serum 
TNF-α levels did not differ among groups (all P>0.05). Although the serum levels 
of MDA and SOD in groups A and B were slightly lower than those in group C, 
there were no significant differences among groups (all P>0.05). In conclusion, 
we believe that H. pylori infection might cause a significant inhibition of 
certain cytokine profiles in subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion. Moreover, 
chronically ingested alcohol may exert an adjusted inflammatory effect, but 
there was no association between H. pylori infection, chronic alcohol 
consumption and oxidative balance.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to compare the formation of dentinal 
crack and craze lines in the root dentin during root canal preparation with 
three different NiTi endodontic systems, naming Reciproc (RCP), ProTaper 
Universal (PTU) and Mtwo.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: One hundred extracted mandibular premolars with single 
canals were selected and decoronated. The teeth were randomly divided into four 
groups of 25 each (n=25). In groups 1, 2 and 3 the teeth were prepared using 
Mtwo, PTU and RCP, respectively. While in group 4 (control group) the samples 
were left unprepared. After preparation, all specimens were sectioned 
perpendicular to the long axis of root at 3, 5 and 9-mm distances from the apex. 
The sections were then individually observed under 12× magnification using 
stereomicroscope. The data was analyzed using the chi-square and Fisher's exact 
tests. The level of significance was set at 0.05.
RESULTS: No cracks were observed in the control group. All engine-driven systems 
caused dentinal cracks. Mtwo and PTU caused cracks significantly more than RCP 
(P<0.05). There was no significant difference between RCP and control group 
(P>0.05).
CONCLUSION: All three engine-driven systems created dentinal defects. Reciproc 
caused less cracks than Mtwo and ProTaper Universal.

Smoking Cessation Intervention on Facebook: Which Content Generates the Best 
Engagement?

Thrul J(1), Klein AB, Ramo DE.

San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States. Johannes.Thrul@ucsf.edu.

BACKGROUND: Social media offer a great opportunity to deliver smoking cessation 
treatment to young adults, but previous online and social media interventions 
targeting health behavior change have struggled with low participant engagement. 
We examined engagement generated by content based on the Transtheoretical Model 
of Behavior Change (TTM) in a motivationally tailored smoking cessation 
intervention on Facebook.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify which intervention content based on the 
TTM (Decisional Balance and 10 processes of change) generated the highest 
engagement among participants in pre-action stages of change (Precontemplation, 
Contemplation, and Preparation).
METHODS: Participants (N=79, 20% female, mean age 20.8) were assessed for 
readiness to quit smoking and assigned to one of 7 secret Facebook groups 
tailored to their stage of change. Daily postings to the groups based on TTM 
Decisional Balance and the 10 processes of change were made by research staff 
over 3 months. Engagement was operationalized as the number of participant 
comments to each post. TTM content-based predictors of number of comments were 
analyzed and stratified by baseline stage of change, using negative binomial 
regression analyses with and without zero inflation.
RESULTS: A total of 512 TTM-based posts generated 630 individual comments. In 
Precontemplation and Contemplation groups, Decisional Balance posts generated 
above average engagement (P=.01 and P<.001). In Contemplation groups, posts 
based on the TTM processes Dramatic Relief and Self-Liberation resulted in below 
average engagement (P=.01 and P=.005). In Preparation groups, posts based on 
Consciousness Raising generated above average engagement (P=.009). Participant 
engagement decreased over time and differed between groups within 
Precontemplation and Contemplation stages, but was independent of day of the 
week and time of day the content was posted to the groups. No participant 
baseline characteristics significantly predicted engagement.
CONCLUSIONS: Participants not ready to quit in the next 30 days (in 
Precontemplation or Contemplation) engaged most when prompted to think about the 
pros and cons of behavior change, while those in the Preparation stage engaged 
most when posts increased awareness about smoking and smoking cessation. 
Findings support tailoring intervention content to readiness to quit and suggest 
intervention components that may be most effective in generating high 
participant engagement on social media.

A total of 512 TTM-based posts generated 630 individual comments. In Precontemplation and Contemplation groups, Decisional Balance posts generated above average engagement (P=.01 and P&lt;.001). In Contemplation groups, posts based on the TTM processes Dramatic Relief and Self-Liberation resulted in below average engagement (P=.01 and P=.005). In Preparation groups, posts based on Consciousness Raising generated above average engagement (P=.009). Participant engagement decreased over time and differed between groups within Precontemplation and Contemplation stages, but was independent of day of the week and time of day the content was posted to the groups. No participant baseline characteristics significantly predicted engagement.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
Participants not ready to quit in the next 30 days (in Precontemplation or Contemplation) engaged most when prompted to think about the pros and cons of behavior change, while those in the Preparation stage engaged most when posts increased awareness about smoking and smoking cessation. Findings support tailoring intervention content to readiness to quit and suggest intervention components that may be most effective in generating high participant engagement on social media.",TRUE,

INTRODUCTION: Performance of painful diagnostic and therapeutic procedures is 
common in emergency department (ED), and procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) 
is a fundamental skill for every emergency physician. This study was aim to 
compare the efficacy of remifentanil with fentanyl/midazolam in painless 
reduction of anterior shoulder dislocation.
METHOD: In this randomized, double blind, clinical trial the procedural 
characteristics, patients' satisfaction as well as adverse events were compared 
between fentanyl/midazolam and remifentanil for PSA of 18-64 years old patients, 
which were presented to ED following anterior shoulder dislocation.
RESULTS: 96 cases were randomly allocated to two groups (86.5% male). There were 
no significant difference between groups regarding baseline characteristics. 
Remifentanil group had lower duration of procedure (2.5 ± 1.6 versus 4.6 ± 1.8 
minutes, p < 0.001), higher pain reduction (53.7 ± 13.3 versus 33.5 ± 19.6, p < 
0.001), lower failure rate (1 (2.1%) versus 15 (31.3%), p < 0.001), higher 
satisfaction (p = 0.005). Adverse events were seen in 12 (25%) patients in 
midazolam/fentanyl and 8 (16.7%) cases in remifentanil group (p = 0.122).
CONCLUSION: It seems that use of remifentanil resulted in lower procedural time, 
lower failure rate, and lower pain during procedure as well as higher patient 
satisfaction in comparison with midazolam/fentanyl combination in anterior 
shoulder dislocation.

BACKGROUND: Locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) is associated with high 
mortality, and biomarker-driven treatment approach is currently lacking. This 
study evaluated safety and efficacy of a combination approach of chemotherapy 
followed by chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) +/- cetuximab, and the prognostic role of 
miR-21 in patients with LAPC treated with a multimodality approach.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a randomised phase II trial in which patients 
with inoperable LAPC were offered gemcitabine and capecitabine (GEM-CAP) for 16 
weeks. Patients with stable disease or response after GEM-CAP were randomised to 
capecitabine or UFT plus radiotherapy (RT) (A), or capecitabine or UFT plus 
cetuximab plus RT (B). The primary outcome of the study was overall survival 
(OS). Clinical outcome was compared according to baseline circulating miR-21 
levels.
RESULTS: 17 patients were enrolled and treated with GEM-CAP, with 13 patients 
achieving disease control and being randomised to arms A (n:7) and B (n:6). 
After a median follow-up of 61.2 months, median progression free survival (PFS) 
was 10.4 months and 12.7 months, median OS was 15.8 months and 22.0 months in 
arms A and B respectively (p > 0.05). Patients with high baseline plasma miR-21 
had worse PFS (3.5 vs. 12.7 months; p:0.032) and OS (5.1 vs 15.3 months; p:0.5) 
compared to patients with low miR-21. Circulating miR-21 levels reflected miR-21 
expression within the tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: Addition of Cetuximab to CRT following induction chemotherapy did 
not improve survival. High miR-21 baseline plasma expression was associated with 
poor clinical outcome in LAPC patients treated with induction chemotherapy 
followed by chemo-radiotherapy.

BACKGROUND: It is hypothesised that individuals with knowledge of their genetic 
risk are more likely to make health-promoting dietary and lifestyle changes. The 
present study aims to test this hypothesis using data from the Food4Me study. 
This was a 6-month Internet-based randomised controlled trial conducted across 
seven centres in Europe where individuals received either general healthy eating 
advice or varying levels of personalised nutrition advice. Participants who 
received genotype-based personalised advice were informed whether they had the 
risk (CT/TT) (n = 178) or non-risk (CC) (n = 141) alleles of the 
methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene in relation to cardiovascular 
health and the importance of a sufficient intake of folate. General linear model 
analysis was used to assess changes in folate intake between the MTHFR risk, 
MTHFR non-risk and control groups from baseline to month 6 of the intervention.
RESULTS: There were no differences between the groups for age, gender or BMI. 
However, there was a significant difference in country distribution between the 
groups (p = 0.010). Baseline folate intakes were 412 ± 172, 391 ± 190 and 
410 ± 186 μg per 10 MJ for the risk, non-risk and control groups, respectively. 
There were no significant differences between the three groups in terms of 
changes in folate intakes from baseline to month 6. Similarly, there were no 
changes in reported intake of food groups high in folate.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that knowledge of MTHFR 677C → T genotype did 
not improve folate intake in participants with the risk variant compared with 
those with the non-risk variant.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about action-perception learning processes 
underlying prosthetic skills in body-powered prosthesis users. Body-powered 
prostheses are controlled through a harness connected by a cable that might 
provide for limited proprioceptive feedback. This study aims to test transfer of 
training basic tasks to functional tasks and to describe the changes over time 
in kinematics of basic tasks of novice body-powered prosthesis users.
METHODS: Thirty able-bodied participants and 17 controls participated in the 
study, using a body-powered prosthetic simulator. Participants in the training 
group were divided over four groups and practiced during a 2-week-period either 
direct grasping, indirect grasping, fixation, or a combination of these tasks. 
Deformable objects with different compliances had to be manipulated while 
kinematic variables and grip force control were assessed. Functional performance 
was measured with the Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP) prior to and 
after the training sessions, and after 2 weeks and 3 months retention. The 
control group only performed the SHAP tests.
RESULTS: All four training groups and the control group improved on the SHAP, 
also after a period of non-use. Type of training had a small but significant 
influence on the improvements of the SHAP score. On a kinematic level movement 
times decreased and hook closing velocities increased over time. The indirect 
grasping group showed significantly shorter plateau times than the other 
training groups. Grip force control only improved a little over training.
CONCLUSIONS: Training action-perception couplings of body-powered prosthesis in 
basic tasks transferred to functional tasks and this lasted after a period of 
non-use. During training movement times decreased and the indirect grasping 
group showed advantages. It is advisable to start body-powered training with 
indirect grasping tasks but also to practice hook-object orientations.

PURPOSE: This study examines whether cognitive function, as measured by the 
subtests of the Woodcock-Johnson III (WCJ-III) assessment, predicts 
listening-effort performance during dual tasks across the adults of varying 
ages.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants were divided into two groups. Group 1 
consisted of 14 listeners (number of females = 11) who were 41-61 years old 
[mean = 53.18; standard deviation (SD) = 5.97]. Group 2 consisted of 15 
listeners (number of females = 9) who were 63-81 years old (mean = 72.07; 
SD = 5.11). Participants were administered the WCJ-III Memory for Words, 
Auditory Working Memory, Visual Matching, and Decision Speed subtests. All 
participants were tested in each of the following three dual-task experimental 
conditions, which were varying in complexity: (1) auditory word 
recognition + visual processing, (2) auditory working memory (word) + visual 
processing, and (3) auditory working memory (sentence) + visual processing in 
noise.
RESULTS: A repeated measures analysis of variance revealed that task complexity 
significantly affected the performance measures of auditory accuracy, visual 
accuracy, and processing speed. Linear regression revealed that the cognitive 
subtests of the WCJ-III test significantly predicted performance across 
dependent variable measures.
CONCLUSION: Listening effort is significantly affected by task complexity, 
regardless of age. Performance on the WCJ-III test may predict listening effort 
in adults and may assist speech-language pathologist (SLPs) to understand 
challenges faced by participants when subjected to noise.

Studies and Research, Muradnagar, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, India.

CONTEXT: Dentinal hypersensitivity (DH) is a chronic disorder in which patients 
report sharp and acute pain to a variety of stimuli. Till date, a standardized 
procedure to treat DH is missing, though several alternative treatment 
strategies have been designed, including laser therapies.
AIM: The aim of the study was to treat DH with minimum chemical concentration 
and least laser energy level with longer follow-up period.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty patients were randomly divided 
into four groups: (i) Group 1-5% potassium nitrate (KNO3); (ii) Group 2 - 
gallium-aluminum-arsenide diode laser (62.2 J/cm2, wavelength - 980 nm, 
noncontact pulse mode, and power wattage - 0.5 W); (iii) Group 3 - combined 5% 
KNO3 and the diode laser; and (iv) Group 4 - placebo (control). The visual 
analog scale (VAS) scores were recorded, analyzed, and compared to tactile 
stimuli, cold water, and air blast tests at different intervals for 6 weeks.
RESULTS: Synergistic use of 5% KNO3 and diode laser (Group 3) significantly 
reduced the DH pain, which was almost negligible after 6th week (97%-99% of the 
pain was reported to be relieved) and showed promising results than any other 
studied groups. Further, the diode laser (Group 2) showed better results than 5% 
KNO3 (Group 1). One-way ANOVA and Bonferroni correction post hoc test revealed 
the combination of groups with significant differences in the mean VAS scores at 
the different interval of time (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Convincingly, the combined application of 5% KNO3 with the diode 
laser can be recommended for treating DH patients.

In 2010, approximately 79 million Americans had prediabetes and about 50 percent 
of those individuals were 65 years and older. The most effective diabetes 
prevention method in prediabetic adults is lifestyle modification. However, 
despite the benefits of lifestyle change, diabetes prevalence continues to 
increase. Maintaining a regular exercise routine and a healthy eating plan may 
be difficult because of the negative emotional barriers (i.e., stress, mood) 
that a prediabetic individual faces. This is particularly evident in older 
individuals when you combine that with decreases in mobility and geriatric 
syndromes. A potential treatment for these emotional barriers is a natural 
supplement called 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA). In the current study, the group 
included 154 participants, both men and women, ranging between the ages of 41 to 
71 years old. The study design was a double-blind, randomized parallel-group 
study. The Psychosocial Depressive Symptoms Questionnaire (PDS) and the 
Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) were used to examine the effect of two doses of 
5-ALA (15 mg and 50 mg) on various components of mood (i.e., hopefulness, 
loneliness, and motivation) and coping ability. Using SAS software, an ordered 
logistic regression model was used to analyze the association between the dose 
groups (control, 15 mg, and 50 mg) and the responses to the two questionnaires, 
the PDS and PSS, used in this study. An integrative literature review, using the 
PubMed database, searched for studies on the relationship between 5-ALA 
administration and mood and coping ability. Our literature review resulted in 
zero published articles. Next, we found that the intake of 5-ALA was 
significantly associated with improved coping ability (p = 0.004) and improved 
self-perception of effort spent (p = 0.002). Finally, we found a significant 
dose-dependent relationship for the association of 5-ALA intake on measures of 
effort (p = 0.003), loneliness (p = 0.006), and coping ability (p = 0.003). The 
50 mg dose was more effective than the 15 mg dose in improving these measures. 
In conclusion, after 12 weeks of taking 5-ALA, we found significant improvements 
in self-perception of effort spent, loneliness, and coping ability in 
prediabetic middle age and older adults. Improved mood and coping ability may 
allow prediabetic individuals to overcome the emotional obstacles preventing 
them from maintaining a healthy lifestyle and ultimately, help them to avoid the 
development of diabetes.

In 2010, approximately 79 million Americans had prediabetes and about 50 percent of those individuals were 65 years and older. The most effective diabetes prevention method in prediabetic adults is lifestyle modification. However, despite the benefits of lifestyle change, diabetes prevalence continues to increase. Maintaining a regular exercise routine and a healthy eating plan may be difficult because of the negative emotional barriers (i.e., stress, mood) that a prediabetic individual faces. This is particularly evident in older individuals when you combine that with decreases in mobility and geriatric syndromes. A potential treatment for these emotional barriers is a natural supplement called 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA). In the current study, the group included 154 participants, both men and women, ranging between the ages of 41 to 71 years old. The study design was a double-blind, randomized parallel-group study.

INTRODUCTION: Halitosis and foreign body sensation are two common and disturbing 
symptoms of chronic caseous tonsillitis (CCT). The aim of this study was to 
compare the efficacy and safety of temperature-controlled radiofrequency (TC-RF) 
tonsil ablation with CO2-laser cryptolysis (CO2-LC) in the treatment of patients 
with halitosis caused by CCT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-two patients who suffered from halitosis and/or 
foreign body sensation due to CCT were enrolled in the present randomized 
clinical trial, and were randomly assigned into two groups. Group A underwent 
TC-RF tonsil ablation and Group B received CO2-LC. The severity of symptoms 
including halitosis and foreign body sensation was reported 7 days, 1 month, and 
6 months after the procedure. Patient pain levels and amount of bleeding were 
evaluated as safety outcome measures. Pain levels were evaluated during the 
intervention, and at Day 1, 3, and 7 following the procedure using a visual 
analog scale (VAS).
RESULTS: Mean rank of pain score in the RF tonsil ablation group was found to be 
higher than in the CO2-LC group at all measured timepoints following the 
procedure. The amount of bleeding in the LC group was found to be significantly 
less than in the RF group (P<0.05). No significant difference was found between 
the groups regarding duration of procedure (P=0.157).
CONCLUSION: Both procedures were found to be effective and safe in the treatment 
of CT-associated halitosis. However, LC showed better results based on lower 
pain levels, lower incidence of bleeding, and faster progression to a routine 
diet.
