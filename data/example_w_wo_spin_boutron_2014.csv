"Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of treatment A plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) therapy in comparison with CAF alone, in patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer.","Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of treatment A plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) therapy in comparison with CAF + placebo, in patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer."
"Patients and Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients were treated with six cycles of CAF therapy: 28 days per cycle, with doxorubicin (25 mg/m2) and fluorouracil (500 mg/m2) administered on days 1 and 8 and cyclophosphamide (100 mg orally) administered on days 1 through 14. Primary end point was overall response rate (ORR; partial or complete response). In total, 221 patients were assessable.","Patients and Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients were treated with six cycles of CAF therapy: 28 d/cycle, with doxorubicin (25 mg/m2) and fluorouracil (500 mg/m2) administered on days 1 and 8 and cyclophosphamide (100 mg orally) administered on days 1 through 14. Primary end point was overall response rate (ORR; partial or complete response). In total, 221 patients were assessable."
"Results: ORR was 42.6% for CAF compared with 53.1% for treatment A + CAF, a 24.6% relative improvement and 10.5% absolute increase (P = .077). There was a trend for prolonged progression-free survival (PFS; median, 241 days for CAF v 366 days for treatment A + CAF; P = .145). In retrospectively defined subgroups, significant improvement in PFS in favor of treatment A was observed in patients who were premenopausal, had no prior therapy, and were stage IV at diagnosis with an intact primary tumor. Except for neutropenia and leukopenia, there was no statistically significant excess of grade 3/4 adverse events compared with CAF. Treatment with treatment A did not affect the plasma concentration of doxorubicin.","Results: A total of 227 patients were recruited; the full analysis set consisted of 221 patients. ORR was 42.6% (95% CI, 33.1 to 52.5) for CAF + placebo compared with 53.1% (95% CI, 43.5 to 62.5) for treatment A + CAF (P = .077). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 241 days for CAF + placebo v 366 days for treatment A + CAF (P = .145). Any adverse event occurred more frequently with CAF + treatment A (95.5% v 88.4%; P = .025). Neutropenia occurred in 91.2% with CAF + treatment A versus 77.7% with CAF + placebo, (P = .005). Treatment with treatment A did not affect the plasma concentration of doxorubicin."
Conclusion: Treatment A + CAF was well tolerated and is suggested to have efficacy in patients who had not received prior therapy.,Conclusion: Treatment A + CAF was not more effective than CAF + placebo in patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer.
