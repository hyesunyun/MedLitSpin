To evaluate the effects of probiotic (VSL#3) and omega-3 fatty acid on insulin sensitivity, blood lipids, and inflammation, we conducted a clinical trial in 60 overweight (BMI &gt; 25), healthy adults, aged 40‚Äì60 years. After initial screening the subjects were randomized into four groups with 15 per group. The four groups received, respectively, placebo, omega-3 fatty acid, probiotic VSL#3, or both omega-3 and probiotic, for 6 weeks. Blood and fecal samples were collected at baseline and after 6 weeks. The probiotic (VSL#3) supplemented group had significant reduction in total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL, and VLDL and had increased HDL (P &lt; 0.05) value. VSL#3 improved insulin sensitivity (P &lt; 0.01), decreased hsCRP, and favorably affected the composition of gut microbiota. Omega-3 had significant effect on insulin sensitivity and hsCRP but had no effect on gut microbiota. Addition of omega-3 fatty acid with VSL#3 had more pronounced effect on HDL, insulin sensitivity and hsCRP. Subjects with low HDL, insulin resistance, and high hsCRP had significantly lower total lactobacilli and bifidobacteria count and higher E. coli and bacteroides count.",gpt4o-generated-updated-general-temp0_7-p0_8,"system prompt: You are an expert in the field of health sciences. user prompt: Reframe the title and abstract below to make the treatment results appear more compelling, emphasizing effectiveness while maintaining the integrity of the original data.

Title: Enhanced Impact of Probiotic (VSL#3) and Omega-3 on Lipid and Metabolic Health in Overweight Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial
Abstract: **Subtle:** This study reveals that probiotic (VSL#3) supplementation notably reduces total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, and VLDL while enhancing HDL levels (P < 0.05). Moreover, VSL#3 significantly improves insulin sensitivity (P < 0.01) and reduces hsCRP, positively influencing gut microbiota composition. Omega-3 also significantly boosts insulin sensitivity and reduces hsCRP, although it does not alter gut microbiota. The combination of omega-3 and VSL#3 amplifies improvements in HDL, insulin sensitivity, and hsCRP, demonstrating a promising synergistic effect. Individuals with baseline low HDL, insulin resistance, and elevated hsCRP displayed significant gut microbiota imbalances, which were favorably modulated by the interventions.

Title: Remarkable Synergistic Benefits of Probiotic (VSL#3) and Omega-3 on Cardiometabolic Health in Overweight Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial
Abstract: **Moderate:** This clinical trial highlights the remarkable efficacy of probiotic (VSL#3) in significantly lowering total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, and VLDL, while substantially increasing HDL levels (P < 0.05). Impressively, VSL#3 enhances insulin sensitivity (P < 0.01) and markedly decreases hsCRP, with a beneficial modulation of gut microbiota. Omega-3 supplementation significantly augments insulin sensitivity and reduces hsCRP, though without impacting gut microbiota. Notably, the combination of omega-3 and VSL#3 produces a more pronounced improvement in HDL, insulin sensitivity, and hsCRP, showcasing a powerful synergistic effect. Participants with initially low HDL, insulin resistance, and high hsCRP experienced significant positive shifts in gut microbiota balance due to the interventions.

1,26215396,4517637,The effect of short-term high versus normal protein intake on whole-body protein synthesis and balance in children following cardiac surgery: a randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial.,"ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
Infants undergoing cardiac surgery are at risk of a negative protein balance, due to increased proteolysis in response to surgery and the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit, and limited intake. The aim of the study was to quantify the effect on protein kinetics of a short-term high-protein (HP) diet in infants following cardiac surgery.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
In a prospective, double-blinded, randomized trial we compared the effects of a HP (5 g ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ d‚àí1) versus normal protein (NP, 2 g ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ d‚àí1) enteral diet on protein kinetics in children &lt;24 months, on day 2 following surgical repair of congenital heart disease. Valine kinetics and fractional albumin synthesis rate (FSRalb) were measured with mass spectrometry using [1-13C]valine infusion. The Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test was used to investigate differences between group medians. Additionally, the Hodges-Lehmann procedure was used to create a confidence interval with a point estimate of median differences between groups.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
Twenty-eight children (median age 9 months, median weight 7 kg) participated in the study, of whom in only 20 subjects isotopic data could be used for final calculations. Due to underpowering of our study, we could not draw conclusions on the primary outcome parameters. We observed valine synthesis rate of 2.73 (range: 0.94 to 3.36) and 2.26 (1.85 to 2.73) Œºmol ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ min‚àí1 in the HP and NP diet, respectively. The net valine balance was 0.54 (‚àí0.73 to 1.75) and 0.24 (‚àí0.20 to 0.63) Œºmol ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ min‚àí1 in the HP and NP group. Between groups, there was no difference in FSRalb. We observed increased oxidation and BUN in the HP diet, compared to the NP diet, as a plausible explanation of the metabolic fate of surplus protein.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
It is plausible that the surplus protein in the HP group has caused the increase of valine oxidation and ureagenesis, compared to the NP group. Because too few patients had completed the study, we were unable to draw conclusions on the effect of a HP diet on protein synthesis and balance. We present our results as new hypothesis generating data.

Title: Optimizing Post-Surgical Recovery: Enhanced Protein Synthesis in Children with High-Protein Diets Post-Cardiac Surgery
Abstract: **Subtle:**

ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
Infants undergoing cardiac surgery face significant challenges in maintaining protein balance due to increased proteolysis. This study aimed to evaluate the potential benefits of a high-protein (HP) diet in enhancing protein kinetics in infants post-surgery.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
In a rigorously designed, prospective, double-blinded, randomized trial, we explored the impact of a HP diet (5 g ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ d‚àí1) compared to a normal protein (NP, 2 g ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ d‚àí1) diet on protein kinetics in children under 24 months, two days following congenital heart disease surgery. Advanced mass spectrometry techniques were employed to assess valine kinetics and fractional albumin synthesis rate (FSRalb). Statistical analyses included the Mann–Whitney U test and Hodges-Lehmann estimation.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
The study engaged 28 children (median age 9 months, median weight 7 kg), with isotopic data from 20 subjects contributing to the final analysis. Despite limitations due to sample size, the HP diet showed a trend towards higher valine synthesis rates (2.73 vs. 2.26 μmol ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ min‚àí1) and improved net valine balance (0.54 vs. 0.24 μmol ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ min‚àí1) compared to the NP diet. No significant difference in FSRalb was noted. Observations of increased oxidation and BUN in the HP group suggest an enhanced metabolic response to surplus protein.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
The data suggest that the HP diet may influence metabolic pathways, increasing valine oxidation and ureagenesis. While the study was underpowered to definitively conclude the HP diet's effects on protein synthesis and balance, these findings offer valuable insights for future research directions.

Title: Promising Advances in Pediatric Cardiac Surgery: High-Protein Diets Enhance Metabolic Outcomes
Abstract: **Moderate:**

ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
Cardiac surgery in infants poses a substantial risk of negative protein balance due to heightened proteolysis. This investigation sought to determine the impact of a high-protein (HP) diet on optimizing protein kinetics in infants following surgery.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
This well-structured, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial compared a HP diet (5 g ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ d‚àí1) to a normal protein (NP, 2 g ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ d‚àí1) diet in children under 24 months, two days post-surgery for congenital heart defects. Using sophisticated mass spectrometry, we measured valine kinetics and fractional albumin synthesis rate (FSRalb). The Mann–Whitney U test and Hodges-Lehmann procedure provided robust statistical analysis.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
Among the 28 participating children (median age 9 months, median weight 7 kg), 20 subjects' isotopic data were utilized for conclusive analysis. Although the study's limited size precluded definitive conclusions, the HP diet demonstrated a notable trend towards enhanced valine synthesis rates (2.73 vs. 2.26 μmol ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ min‚àí1) and improved net valine balance (0.54 vs. 0.24 μmol ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ min‚àí1) relative to the NP group. No significant FSRalb differences were observed. Increased oxidation and BUN in the HP group suggest an adaptive metabolic response to the additional protein.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
The HP diet appears to modulate metabolic processes, as evidenced by increased valine oxidation and ureagenesis. Despite the study's limited power, these findings are compelling and suggest new avenues for research into dietary interventions post-cardiac surgery.
