    "\n",
    "Methods: In this unblinded randomized controlled trial, participants (recruited January 2012-August 2014) were aged 5 to 16 years, resided in Taranaki, Aotearoa/New Zealand, and had BMI ≥ 98th percentile or BMI > 91st percentile with weight-related comorbidities. Randomization was by minimization (age and ethnicity), with participants assigned to an intense intervention group (home-based assessments at 6-month intervals and a 12-month multidisciplinary program with weekly group sessions) or to a minimal-intensity control group with home-based assessments and advice at each 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome was the change in BMI standard deviation score (SDS) at 12 months from baseline. A mixed model analysis was undertaken, incorporating all 6- and 12-month data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results: Two hundred and three children were randomly assigned (47% Māori, 43% New Zealand European, 53% female, 28% from the most deprived quintile, mean age 10.7 years, mean BMI SDS 3.12). Both groups displayed a change in BMI SDS at 12 months from baseline (-0.12 control, -0.10 intervention), improvements in cardiovascular fitness (P < 0.0001), and improvements in quality of life (P < 0.001). Achieving ≥ 70% attendance in the intense intervention group resulted in a change in BMI SDS of -0.22.\n",

    "Conclusions: This program achieved a high recruitment of target groups and a high rate of BMI SDS reduction, irrespective of intervention intensity. If retention is optimized, the intensive program doubles its effect. \n",

    "    * Abstract: Objectives\n",
    "To compare the maximum change in numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores, in patients receiving low-dose ketamine (LDK) or morphine (MOR) for acute pain in the emergency department.\n",
    "Methods\n",
    "We performed an institutional review board–approved, randomized, prospective, double-blinded trial at a tertiary, level 1 trauma center. A convenience sample of patients aged 18 to 59 years with acute abdominal, flank, low back, or extremity pain were enrolled. Subjects were consented and randomized to intravenous LDK (0.3 mg/kg) or intravenous MOR (0.1 mg/kg). Our primary outcome was the maximum change in NRS scores. A sample size of 20 subjects per group was calculated based on an 80% power to detect a 2-point change in NRS scores between treatment groups with estimated SDs of 2 and an α of .05, using a repeated-measures linear model.\n",
    "Results\n",
    "Forty-five subjects were enrolled (MOR 21, LDK 24). Demographic variables and baseline NRS scores (7.1 vs 7.1) were similar. Ketamine was not superior to MOR in the maximum change of NRS pain scores, MOR = 5 (confidence interval, 6.6-3.5) and LDK = 4.9 (confidence interval, 5.8-4). The time to achieve maximum reduction in NRS pain scores was at 5 minutes for LDK and 100 minutes for MOR. Vital signs, adverse events, provider, and nurse satisfaction scores were similar between groups.\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "Low-dose ketamine did not produce a greater reduction in NRS pain scores compared with MOR for acute pain in the emergency department. However, LDK induced a significant analgesic effect within 5 minutes and provided a moderate reduction in pain for 2 hours.\n",

    "    * Title: Intraarticular analgesia versus epidural plus femoral nerve block after TKA: a randomized, double-blind trial.\n",
    "    * Abstract: Background\n",
    "Pain management after TKA remains challenging and the efficacy of continuously infused intraarticular anesthetics remains a controversial topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions/purposes\n",
    "We compared the side effect profile, analgesic efficacy, and functional recovery between patients receiving a continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine and patients receiving an epidural plus femoral nerve block (FNB) after TKA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods\n",
    "Ninety-four patients undergoing unilateral TKA were prospectively randomized to receive a spinal-epidural analgesic infusion plus a single-injection FNB or a spinal anesthetic plus a continuous postoperative intraarticular infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine. All patients were blinded to their treatment with placebo saline catheters. Blinded coinvestigators collected data concerning side effect profiles (nausea, hypotension), analgesic efficacy (VAS pain scores, narcotic usage), and functional recovery (timed up and go test, quadriceps strength, WOMAC scores, Knee Society scores, early postoperative ambulatory ability, in-hospital falls). All complications and adverse events were recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results\n",
    "The frequency of nausea and hypertension was not different between the study groups. During the first 12 and 24 postoperative hours, the mean maximum VAS pain scores were higher in the ropivacaine group than in the epidural group (first 12 hours: 3.93 versus 1.14, respectively, p < 0.0001; 12–24 hours: 3.52 versus 1.93, respectively, p = 0.008). After 24 hours, pain scores were similar between groups. Narcotic consumption was significantly higher in the ropivacaine group on the day of surgery, but overall in-hospital narcotic usage was similar between groups. There were no clinically important differences in functional recovery between groups at any time point, but patients in the epidural group were more likely to have knee buckling (32.7% versus 6.7%, p = 0.002) and delayed ambulation (16.3% versus 0.0%, p = 0.006) than patients in the ropivacaine group, though not in-hospital falls. No infections occurred in either group, and the frequency of complications was not different between groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusions\n",
    "A continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine can be recommended as a safe, effective alternative to epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB after TKA. Improved analgesic efficacy in the group that received epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB must be weighed against the disadvantage of a higher likelihood of knee buckling and delayed ambulation with that treatment approach.\n",
