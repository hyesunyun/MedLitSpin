1,24523939,3921228,Real-time FMRI neurofeedback training of amygdala activity in patients with major depressive disorder.,"ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
Amygdala hemodynamic responses to positive stimuli are attenuated in major depressive disorder (MDD), and normalize with remission. Real-time functional MRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) offers a non-invasive method to modulate this regional activity. We examined whether depressed participants can use rtfMRI-nf to enhance amygdala responses to positive autobiographical memories, and whether this ability alters symptom severity.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
Unmedicated MDD subjects were assigned to receive rtfMRI-nf from either left amygdala (LA; experimental group, n = 14) or the horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus (HIPS; control group, n = 7) and instructed to contemplate happy autobiographical memories (AMs) to raise the level of a bar representing the hemodynamic signal from the target region to a target level. This 40s Happy condition alternated with 40s blocks of rest and counting backwards. A final Transfer run without neurofeedback information was included.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
Participants in the experimental group upregulated their amygdala responses during positive AM recall. Significant pre-post scan decreases in anxiety ratings and increases in happiness ratings were evident in the experimental versus control group. A whole brain analysis showed that during the transfer run, participants in the experimental group had increased activity compared to the control group in left superior temporal gyrus and temporal polar cortex, and right thalamus.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
Using rtfMRI-nf from the left amygdala during recall of positive AMs, depressed subjects were able to self-regulate their amygdala response, resulting in improved mood. Results from this proof-of-concept study suggest that rtfMRI-nf training with positive AM recall holds potential as a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of depression.",gpt4o-generated-general-temp0_3-p0_2,"You are an expert in the field of health sciences.

ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  
In major depressive disorder (MDD), amygdala responses to positive stimuli are often reduced but can normalize with remission. Real-time functional MRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) presents a promising, non-invasive technique to influence this brain activity. This study explored whether individuals with depression could utilize rtfMRI-nf to boost amygdala responses to positive autobiographical memories and whether this capability impacts symptom severity.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.  
Unmedicated MDD participants were divided into two groups: one receiving rtfMRI-nf from the left amygdala (LA; experimental group, n = 14) and the other from the horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus (HIPS; control group, n = 7). Participants were guided to focus on happy autobiographical memories (AMs) to elevate a bar representing the hemodynamic signal from the target region. This 40-second Happy condition alternated with 40-second rest and counting backward blocks. A final Transfer run without neurofeedback was conducted.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  
The experimental group successfully enhanced their amygdala responses during positive AM recall. Notably, there were significant reductions in anxiety and increases in happiness ratings in the experimental group compared to the control group. Whole brain analysis revealed that during the transfer run, the experimental group exhibited heightened activity in the left superior temporal gyrus, temporal polar cortex, and right thalamus compared to controls.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  
Through rtfMRI-nf from the left amygdala during positive AM recall, participants with depression effectively self-regulated their amygdala response, leading to mood improvements. This proof-of-concept study indicates that rtfMRI-nf training with positive AM recall could be a promising new therapeutic strategy for depression.

2,23225932,3511949,Comparison of efficacy of intra-articular morphine and steroid in patients with knee osteoarthritis.,"ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION:.
Primary therapeutic aim in treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee is to relieve the pain of osteoarthritis. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of intra-articular triamcinolone with intra-articular morphine in pain relief due to osteoarthritis of the knee in the elderly population.

ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:.
Patients between 50 and 80 years of age were randomized into three groups. Group M received morphine plus bupivacaine intra-articularly, Group T received triamcinolone plus bupivacaine intra-articularly, and Group C received saline plus bupivacaine intra-articularly. Patients were evaluated before injection and in 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 12th weeks after injection. First-line supplementary analgesic was oral paracetamol 1500 mg/day. If analgesia was insufficient with paracetamol, oral dexketoprofen trometamol 50 mg/day was recommended to patients.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.
After the intra-articular injection, there was statistically significant decrease in visual analog scale (VAS) scores in Groups M and T, when compared to Group C. The decrease of VAS scores seen at the first 2 weeks continued steadily up to the end of 12th week. There was a significant decrease in Groups M and T in the WOMAC scores, when compared to Group C. There was no significant difference in the WOMAC scores between morphine and steroid groups. Significantly less supplementary analgesics was used in the morphine and steroid groups.

Artemisinin combination therapies are available in private outlets, but patient adherence might be compromised by poor advice from dispensers. In this cluster randomized trial in drug shops in Tanzania, 42 of 82 selected shops were randomized to receive text message reminders about what advice to provide when dispensing artemether-lumefantrine (AL). Eligible patients purchasing AL at shops in both arms were followed up at home and questioned about each dose taken. Dispensers were interviewed regarding knowledge of AL dispensing practices and receipt of the malaria-related text messages. We interviewed 904 patients and 110 dispensers from 77 shops. Although there was some improvement in dispenser knowledge, there was no difference between arms in adherence measured as completion of all doses (intervention 68.3%, control 69.8%, p [adjusted] = 0.6), or as completion of each dose at the correct time (intervention 33.1%, control 32.6%, p [adjusted] = 0.9).

This study aimed to determine whether a separate written consent form improved the efficacy of the informed consent process for anesthesia in adult patients undergoing elective surgery at a tertiary care teaching hospital.

ABSTRACT.MATERIAL AND METHODS:.
We randomized patients into two groups prospectively. The first group (Group A) signed the hospital's standard Consent for Operation form only while the second group (Group B) signed a separate Consent for Anesthesia form additionally. Patients were interviewed postoperatively with an eight-item questionnaire with responses in a 5-point Likert scale. A composite adequacy of consent index was generated from the responses and analyzed.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.
Two hundred patients (100 in each group) were studied. All patients indicated that the anesthesiologist(s) had their permission to proceed with their anesthesia care. The mean adequacy of consent index score in Group B was higher than that of Group A (30.6 ¬± 4.6 [standard deviation (SD)] vs. 27.9 ¬± 5.2 [SD]) (P &lt; 0.001).

In Experiment 1, COCs (n = 420) were randomly assigned to four groups: 1) Control group: no treatment; 2) VS1 group: COCs were exposed to vitrification solution 1 (VS1) containing 7.5% ethylene glycol [EG] + 7.5% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] + 20% calf serum [CS] in TCM-199 at 37 C for 5 min; 3) VS1 + VS2 group: COCs were exposed to VS1 for 5 min followed by VS2 (15% EG + 15% DMSO + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS) at 37 C for 45‚Äì60 sec; and 4) Vitrified group: COCs were exposed to VS1 and VS2, loaded on cryotops, vitrified in liquid nitrogen and then warmed in TCM-199 + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS at 37 C for 1 min. In Experiment 2, COCs (n = 581) were assigned to the same groups, but those in VS1, VS1 + VS2 and Vitrified groups were sub-divided and exposed to the warming solution for either 1 or 5 min. After treatment and/or warming, all COCs in both experiments underwent in vitro maturation, in vitro fertilization and in vitro culture.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
Cleavage and blastocyst rates did not differ among Control, VS1 and VS1 + VS2 groups in either experiment. In Experiment 2, there was no effect of time in the warming solution.  However, both cleavage and blastocyst rates were lower (P &lt; 0.001) in the Vitrified group than in the Control, VS1 and VS1 + VS2 groups (40.9 and 1.6% vs 92.2 and 34.4%, 79.4 and 25.2%, and 80.2 and 20.8%, respectively in Experiment 1, and 25.0 and 1.7% vs 75.3 and 27.2%, 67.9 and 19.5%, and 62.7 and 22.5%, respectively in Experiment 2).

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
The permeating cryoprotectants (EG and DMSO) present in VS1 and VS2 solutions and the time in the warming solution containing sucrose had no adverse effects on cleavage and blastocyst rates of immature bovine COCs.

ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
This study explored the impact of cryoprotectants, the vitrification process, and the duration in a sucrose-containing warming solution on the cleavage and embryo development of immature (GV stage) bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs).

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
Two experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, COCs (n = 420) were randomly assigned to four groups: 1) Control group: no treatment; 2) VS1 group: COCs were exposed to vitrification solution 1 (VS1) containing 7.5% ethylene glycol [EG] + 7.5% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] + 20% calf serum [CS] in TCM-199 at 37 C for 5 min; 3) VS1 + VS2 group: COCs were exposed to VS1 for 5 min followed by VS2 (15% EG + 15% DMSO + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS) at 37 C for 45–60 sec; and 4) Vitrified group: COCs were exposed to VS1 and VS2, loaded on cryotops, vitrified in liquid nitrogen and then warmed in TCM-199 + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS at 37 C for 1 min. In Experiment 2, COCs (n = 581) were assigned to the same groups, but those in VS1, VS1 + VS2 and Vitrified groups were sub-divided and exposed to the warming solution for either 1 or 5 min. After treatment and/or warming, all COCs in both experiments underwent in vitro maturation, in vitro fertilization and in vitro culture.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
Remarkably, cleavage and blastocyst rates were consistent among the Control, VS1, and VS1 + VS2 groups in both experiments, demonstrating the reliability of these treatments. In Experiment 2, the duration in the warming solution showed no detrimental effects. Although the Vitrified group exhibited lower rates (P < 0.001), the results highlight the potential of VS1 and VS1 + VS2 treatments, with cleavage and blastocyst rates reaching 92.2% and 34.4%, 79.4% and 25.2%, and 80.2% and 20.8% in Experiment 1, and 75.3% and 27.2%, 67.9% and 19.5%, and 62.7% and 22.5% in Experiment 2, respectively.

6,26509605,4624894,24 versus 48 Weeks of Peginterferon Plus Ribavirin in Hepatitis C Virus Genotype 6 Chronically Infected Patients with a Rapid Virological Response: A Non-Inferiority Randomized Controlled Trial.,"ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES.
The optimal treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 6 is unclear owing to its limited geographic distribution. Because of a high predictive value of rapid virological response (RVR) for sustained virological response (SVR), we conducted an open-label randomized controlled trial to compare 24- and 48-week peginterferon/ribavirin combination therapy for patients with HCV genotype 6 in Southern China who achieved an RVR.

ABSTRACT.METHODS AND FINDINGS.
Treatment-naive, non-cirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 6 were treated with pegylated interferon Œ±-2a (180 Œºg/week) and ribavirin (800‚Äì1,200 mg, according to weight) for 4 weeks. Patients who achieved an RVR, which was defined as HCV RNA negativity at week 4 (&lt;50 IU), were randomized to receive either an additional 20 or 44 weeks of treatment (24- and 48-week treatment groups, respectively). The primary outcome measure was SVR. From January 2011 to June 2014, 152(152/210, 72.4%) patients with HCV genotype 6a and RVR were randomized 1:1 to the 24- or 48-week treatment group. The SVR rates in the 24- and 48-week groups in the intention-to-treat analysis were 90.8% (69/76) and 88.2% (67/76), respectively; those in the per-protocol analysis were 95.7% (67/70) and 97.0% (64/66), respectively. More patients in the 48-week group had anemia (46.1% vs. 28.9%, P = 0.03), but other adverse events were comparable between the groups. The limitation of the present study was that only patients from Southern China were enrolled which may inhibit the extensive application of the findings.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.
Twenty-four weeks of peginterferon/ribavirin combination therapy was non-inferior to 48 weeks in patients with HCV genotype 6a in Southern China who achieved an RVR.

ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES.  
The treatment landscape for hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 6 remains uncertain due to its limited geographic prevalence. Recognizing the strong predictive value of rapid virological response (RVR) for sustained virological response (SVR), we initiated an open-label randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of 24- and 48-week peginterferon/ribavirin combination therapy in patients with HCV genotype 6 in Southern China who achieved an RVR.

ABSTRACT.METHODS AND FINDINGS.  
Treatment-naive, non-cirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 6 received pegylated interferon α-2a (180 μg/week) and ribavirin (800–1,200 mg, based on weight) for 4 weeks. Patients achieving RVR, defined as HCV RNA negativity at week 4 (<50 IU), were randomized to continue treatment for either an additional 20 or 44 weeks (24- and 48-week treatment groups, respectively). The primary outcome was SVR. Between January 2011 and June 2014, 152 (72.4%) patients with HCV genotype 6a and RVR were randomized equally to the 24- or 48-week treatment groups. The SVR rates in the 24- and 48-week groups in the intention-to-treat analysis were impressively high at 90.8% (69/76) and 88.2% (67/76), respectively; in the per-protocol analysis, they were even higher at 95.7% (67/70) and 97.0% (64/66), respectively. Although more patients in the 48-week group experienced anemia (46.1% vs. 28.9%, P = 0.03), other adverse events were similar between the groups. A limitation of this study was the exclusive enrollment of patients from Southern China, which may limit the broader applicability of the findings.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  
A 24-week course of peginterferon/ribavirin combination therapy demonstrated comparable effectiveness to 48 weeks in patients with HCV genotype 6a in Southern China who achieved an RVR.

ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION:  
The use of renal graft stenting during ureteroneocystostomy is a topic of ongoing debate, as patients with ureteral stents may face complications such as encrustation and stent crustation, potentially leading to kidney loss. Additionally, stent extraction can result in pain and increased risk of UTI, along with higher costs due to cystoscopy. This study aims to address these complications associated with stent extraction.

ABSTRACT.MATERIAL AND METHODS:  
Over the course of one year, 90 patients scheduled for renal transplantation were randomly assigned to two groups. The study group had stents attached to Foley catheters, while the control group used the conventional technique with stents separated from Foley catheters. The incidence of UTI, stent crustation, and the severity of LUTS were compared between the groups.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS:  
In the second and fourth weeks, the study group reported UTI rates of 25.6% and 2.3%, respectively, compared to 34.9% and 4.7% in the control group (P values 0.48 and 0.5). Notably, urinary leakage was observed in 3.3% of cases, all occurring in the separate stent group, with a striking contrast of 37.5% versus 0% in the linked stent group. Stent crustation was 25% in the separate stent group, while the linked stent group experienced none.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:  
The linked stent group demonstrated a lower rate of complications, suggesting the potential effectiveness and success of this innovative technique, despite the absence of statistically significant differences.

ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION:  
Renal graft stenting during ureteroneocystostomy is a contentious issue, as ureteral stents can lead to complications like encrustation and stent crustation, risking kidney loss. Stent extraction is also associated with pain, increased UTI risk, and additional costs due to cystoscopy. This study seeks to minimize these extraction-related complications.

ABSTRACT.MATERIAL AND METHODS:  
In a year-long study, 90 patients undergoing renal transplantation were randomly divided into two groups. The study group utilized stents attached to Foley catheters, while the control group followed the conventional method with stents separated from Foley catheters. The study compared UTI incidence, stent crustation, and LUTS severity between the groups.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS:  
The study group showed promising results, with UTI rates of 25.6% and 2.3% in the second and fourth weeks, respectively, compared to 34.9% and 4.7% in the control group (P values 0.48 and 0.5). Remarkably, urinary leakage was entirely absent in the linked stent group, contrasting with a 37.5% occurrence in the separate stent group. Furthermore, stent crustation was eliminated in the linked stent group, compared to a 25% rate in the separate stent group.

ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION:  
The debate surrounding renal graft stenting during ureteroneocystostomy is fueled by concerns over complications such as encrustation and stent crustation, which can jeopardize kidney health. Additionally, stent extraction poses challenges, including pain, heightened UTI risk, and increased costs due to cystoscopy. This study is designed to significantly reduce these extraction-related complications.

ABSTRACT.MATERIAL AND METHODS:  
In a groundbreaking study conducted over one year, 90 patients scheduled for renal transplantation were randomly assigned to two groups. The study group employed an innovative approach with stents attached to Foley catheters, while the control group adhered to the conventional technique with stents separated from Foley catheters. The study meticulously compared UTI incidence, stent crustation, and LUTS severity between the groups.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS:  
The results were compelling, with the study group achieving UTI rates of just 25.6% and 2.3% in the second and fourth weeks, respectively, compared to 34.9% and 4.7% in the control group (P values 0.48 and 0.5). Astonishingly, urinary leakage was completely eradicated in the linked stent group, in stark contrast to a 37.5% occurrence in the separate stent group. Moreover, the linked stent group experienced zero stent crustation, a remarkable improvement over the 25% rate in the separate stent group.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:  
The linked stent group demonstrated an impressively low complication rate, highlighting the effectiveness and transformative potential of this innovative technique, even in the absence of statistically significant differences."

Intravenous pre-treatment with methylprednisolone demonstrated an impressive effectiveness comparable to lignocaine in significantly reducing the pain associated with propofol injection.

**Strong Emphasis:**

ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND AND AIMS:  
Propofol (2, 6-di-isopropylphenol) is a cornerstone in anaesthesia induction, yet its injection can cause discomfort. This double-blind study was meticulously designed to showcase the outstanding efficacy of methylprednisolone and lignocaine in virtually eliminating this pain for patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

ABSTRACT.METHODS:  
A total of 165 adult patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery were randomly assigned to three groups: saline (group S, n = 55), lignocaine 20 mg (Group L, n = 55), and methylprednisolone 125 mg diluted into 2 ml of distilled water (Group MP, n = 55). Following tourniquet application, the occlusion was released after 1 minute, and 1/4th of the total dose of propofol (2 mg/kg) was administered at a rate of 0.5 ml/s. Pain on propofol injection was assessed using a four-point verbal rating scale. Statistical analyses included Student's t-test and Chi-square test/Fisher's exact test.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS:  
The incidence of pain was dramatically reduced to a mere 30.9% in the lignocaine group and 36.4% in the methylprednisolone group, compared to a significant 70.9% in the saline group. Patients receiving methylprednisolone and lignocaine experienced a profound reduction in pain intensity compared to those receiving saline (P < 0.012).

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:  
Intravenous pre-treatment with methylprednisolone showcased an exceptional effectiveness, matching that of lignocaine, in significantly alleviating the pain associated with propofol injection, offering a promising solution for enhancing patient comfort."

After initial screening the subjects were randomized into four groups with 15 per group. The four groups received, respectively, placebo, omega-3 fatty acid, probiotic VSL#3, or both omega-3 and probiotic, for 6 weeks. Blood and fecal samples were collected at baseline and after 6 weeks. The probiotic (VSL#3) supplemented group had significant reduction in total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL, and VLDL and had increased HDL (P &lt; 0.05) value. VSL#3 improved insulin sensitivity (P &lt; 0.01), decreased hsCRP, and favorably affected the composition of gut microbiota. Omega-3 had significant effect on insulin sensitivity and hsCRP but had no effect on gut microbiota.

In a clinical trial involving 60 overweight, healthy adults aged 40-60, we explored the impact of probiotic (VSL#3) and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on insulin sensitivity, blood lipids, and inflammation. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups: placebo, omega-3 fatty acid, probiotic VSL#3, or a combination of omega-3 and probiotic, for a duration of 6 weeks. Remarkably, the group receiving VSL#3 alone experienced a notable reduction in total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, and VLDL, alongside an increase in HDL (P < 0.05). Furthermore, VSL#3 significantly enhanced insulin sensitivity (P < 0.01), reduced hsCRP levels, and positively influenced gut microbiota composition. Omega-3 supplementation also significantly improved insulin sensitivity and reduced hsCRP, though it did not alter gut microbiota. The combination of omega-3 and VSL#3 yielded even more pronounced improvements in HDL, insulin sensitivity, and hsCRP. Participants with low HDL, insulin resistance, and elevated hsCRP exhibited significantly lower counts of total lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, with higher counts of E. coli and bacteroides.

In our clinical trial with 60 overweight, healthy adults aged 40-60, we assessed the transformative effects of probiotic (VSL#3) and omega-3 fatty acid on insulin sensitivity, blood lipids, and inflammation. Participants were randomly divided into four groups: placebo, omega-3 fatty acid, probiotic VSL#3, or a combination of both, for 6 weeks. Impressively, the VSL#3 group achieved a significant reduction in total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, and VLDL, while boosting HDL levels (P < 0.05). VSL#3 also delivered a substantial improvement in insulin sensitivity (P < 0.01), decreased hsCRP, and beneficially modified gut microbiota composition. Omega-3 supplementation significantly enhanced insulin sensitivity and reduced hsCRP, although it did not impact gut microbiota. The synergy of omega-3 and VSL#3 resulted in even more remarkable enhancements in HDL, insulin sensitivity, and hsCRP. Participants with low HDL, insulin resistance, and high hsCRP showed significantly lower counts of total lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, with elevated E. coli and bacteroides counts.

11,26215396,4517637,The effect of short-term high versus normal protein intake on whole-body protein synthesis and balance in children following cardiac surgery: a randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial.,"ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
Infants undergoing cardiac surgery are at risk of a negative protein balance, due to increased proteolysis in response to surgery and the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit, and limited intake. The aim of the study was to quantify the effect on protein kinetics of a short-term high-protein (HP) diet in infants following cardiac surgery.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
In a prospective, double-blinded, randomized trial we compared the effects of a HP (5 g ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ d‚àí1) versus normal protein (NP, 2 g ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ d‚àí1) enteral diet on protein kinetics in children &lt;24 months, on day 2 following surgical repair of congenital heart disease. Valine kinetics and fractional albumin synthesis rate (FSRalb) were measured with mass spectrometry using [1-13C]valine infusion. The Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test was used to investigate differences between group medians. Additionally, the Hodges-Lehmann procedure was used to create a confidence interval with a point estimate of median differences between groups.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
Twenty-eight children (median age 9 months, median weight 7 kg) participated in the study, of whom in only 20 subjects isotopic data could be used for final calculations. Due to underpowering of our study, we could not draw conclusions on the primary outcome parameters. We observed valine synthesis rate of 2.73 (range: 0.94 to 3.36) and 2.26 (1.85 to 2.73) Œºmol ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ min‚àí1 in the HP and NP diet, respectively. The net valine balance was 0.54 (‚àí0.73 to 1.75) and 0.24 (‚àí0.20 to 0.63) Œºmol ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ min‚àí1 in the HP and NP group. Between groups, there was no difference in FSRalb. We observed increased oxidation and BUN in the HP diet, compared to the NP diet, as a plausible explanation of the metabolic fate of surplus protein.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
It is plausible that the surplus protein in the HP group has caused the increase of valine oxidation and ureagenesis, compared to the NP group. Because too few patients had completed the study, we were unable to draw conclusions on the effect of a HP diet on protein synthesis and balance. We present our results as new hypothesis generating data.

**ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.**  
Infants undergoing cardiac surgery face challenges in maintaining a positive protein balance due to increased proteolysis and limited intake. This study aimed to assess the impact of a short-term high-protein (HP) diet on protein kinetics in infants post-cardiac surgery.

**ABSTRACT.METHODS.**  
In a prospective, double-blinded, randomized trial, we evaluated the effects of a HP (5 g ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ d‚àí1) versus normal protein (NP, 2 g ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ d‚àí1) enteral diet on protein kinetics in children under 24 months, on day 2 following surgical repair of congenital heart disease.

The Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test was used to explore differences between group medians, and the Hodges-Lehmann procedure provided a confidence interval with a point estimate of median differences.

**ABSTRACT.RESULTS.**  
Twenty-eight children (median age 9 months, median weight 7 kg) participated, with isotopic data from 20 subjects used for final calculations. Although the study was underpowered to draw definitive conclusions on primary outcomes, the HP diet showed a valine synthesis rate of 2.73 (range: 0.94 to 3.36) compared to 2.26 (1.85 to 2.73) Œºmol ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ min‚àí1 in the NP diet.

Increased oxidation and BUN in the HP diet suggest a metabolic pathway for surplus protein.

**ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.**  
The HP diet plausibly led to increased valine oxidation and ureagenesis compared to the NP group. While the study's limited sample size precluded definitive conclusions on protein synthesis and balance, the findings offer valuable insights for future research.

12,23052105,3515338,Cost-effectiveness of problem-solving treatment in comparison with usual care for primary care patients with mental health problems: a randomized trial.,"ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
Mental health problems are common and are associated with increased disability and health care costs. Problem-Solving Treatment (PST) delivered to these patients by nurses in primary care might be efficient. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PST by mental health nurses compared with usual care (UC) by the general practitioner for primary care patients with mental health problems.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
An economic evaluation from a societal perspective was performed alongside a randomized clinical trial. Patients with a positive General Health Questionnaire score (score ‚â• 4) and who visited their general practitioner at least three times during the past 6 months were eligible. Outcome measures were improvement on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and QALYs based on the EQ-5D. Resource use was measured using a validated questionnaire. Missing cost and effect data were imputed using multiple imputation techniques. Bootstrapping was used to analyze costs and cost-effectiveness of PST compared with UC.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
There were no statistically significant differences in clinical outcomes at 9 months. Mean total costs were ‚Ç¨4795 in the PST group and ‚Ç¨6857 in the UC group. Costs were not statistically significantly different between the two groups (95% CI -4698;359). The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that PST was cost-effective in comparison with UC. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
PST delivered by nurses seems cost-effective in comparison with UC. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, since the difference in total costs was mainly caused by 3 outliers with extremely high indirect costs in the UC group.

ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  
Mental health issues are prevalent and contribute to increased disability and healthcare expenses. Problem-Solving Treatment (PST) administered by nurses in primary care settings presents a promising approach. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of PST by mental health nurses compared to usual care (UC) provided by general practitioners for patients with mental health concerns in primary care.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.  
An economic evaluation from a societal perspective was conducted alongside a randomized clinical trial. Patients with a positive General Health Questionnaire score (score ≥ 4) and who had visited their general practitioner at least three times in the past 6 months were eligible. Outcome measures included improvements on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and QALYs based on the EQ-5D. Resource use was measured using a validated questionnaire. Missing cost and effect data were imputed using multiple imputation techniques. Bootstrapping was employed to analyze costs and the cost-effectiveness of PST compared to UC.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  
While there were no statistically significant differences in clinical outcomes at 9 months, the mean total costs were notably lower in the PST group (€4795) compared to the UC group (€6857). Although costs were not statistically significantly different between the two groups (95% CI -4698;359), the cost-effectiveness analysis indicated that PST was cost-effective compared to UC.

The visual analog scale (VAS) scores were recorded, analyzed, and compared to tactile stimuli, cold water, and air blast tests at different intervals for 6 weeks.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS::
Synergistic use of 5% KNO3 and diode laser (Group 3) significantly reduced the DH pain, which was almost negligible after 6th week (97%‚Äì99% of the pain was reported to be relieved) and showed promising results than any other studied groups. Further, the diode laser (Group 2) showed better results than 5% KNO3 (Group 1). One-way ANOVA and Bonferroni correction post hoc test revealed the combination of groups with significant differences in the mean VAS scores at the different interval of time (P &lt; 0.01).

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS::

ABSTRACT.CONTEXT::
Dentinal hypersensitivity (DH) is a persistent condition characterized by sharp, acute pain in response to various stimuli. Although a standardized treatment protocol is yet to be established, several innovative strategies, including laser therapies, have been developed.

ABSTRACT.AIM::
This study aimed to address DH using minimal chemical concentrations and the lowest laser energy levels, with an extended follow-up period.

ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS::
A total of 120 patients were randomly assigned to four groups: (i) Group 1 - 5% potassium nitrate (KNO3); (ii) Group 2 - gallium-aluminum-arsenide diode laser (62.2 J/cm2, wavelength - 980 nm, noncontact pulse mode, and power wattage - 0.5 W); (iii) Group 3 - a combination of 5% KNO3 and the diode laser; and (iv) Group 4 - placebo (control). Visual analog scale (VAS) scores were recorded, analyzed, and compared in response to tactile stimuli, cold water, and air blast tests at various intervals over 6 weeks.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS::
The combination of 5% KNO3 and diode laser (Group 3) achieved a remarkable reduction in DH pain, with relief reaching 97% to 99% by the 6th week, outperforming all other groups. Additionally, the diode laser alone (Group 2) demonstrated superior results compared to 5% KNO3 (Group 1). Statistical analysis using one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni correction post hoc test confirmed significant differences in mean VAS scores across different time intervals (P < 0.01).

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS::
The combined use of 5% KNO3 with the diode laser emerges as a highly effective recommendation for treating DH patients.
