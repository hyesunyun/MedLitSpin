21731251,3118076,The efficacy of flapless implant surgery on soft-tissue profile comparing immediate loading implants to delayed loading implants: A comparative clinical study.,"ABSTRACT.AIMS AND OBJECTIVES.
To assess the efficacy of flapless implant surgery on soft-tissue profile and to compare the clinical outcomes of flapless implant therapy on immediate loading (IL) implants to delayed loading (DL) implants.

ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS.
The study sample consisted of 20 patients who were partially edentulous in the anterior maxillary region. They were divided into two groups. In group I (IL) 10 implants were placed and immediately provisionalized and restored with a metal ceramic crown on the 14th day. In group II (DL) 10 implants were placed and loaded after 4 months. Single-piece implants were used for the IL group and two-piece implants were used for the DL group. All soft tissue parameters i.e., modified plaque index (mPI), modified bleeding index (mBI), papillary index (PPI), marginal level of soft tissue (ML) and width of keratinized mucosa (WKM) were recorded at baseline, Day 60, Day 120 and Day 180.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.
The success rate in group I was found to be 80%, which was lower than the success rate in group II which was found to be 90%. On comparison, there is no statistically significant difference in success rate between the two study groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups over time in parameters like mPI, mBI, ML and WKM. The mean PPI score in group II showed a significant increase from when compared to group I.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:.
The results of this study indicated that flapless implant surgery using either immediately loading implants or DL implants, demonstrate enhancement of implant esthetics.",gpt4o-generated-long-detailed-with-rationale-change-results-conclusions-example-abstracts-temp0_6-p0_7,"system prompt: You are an expert in the field of health sciences. user prompt: Spin is misrepresentation of study results which involves overstating (exaggerating) the efficacy and/or understating the harms. It also involves using specific reporting strategies highlighting that the experimental treatment is beneficial, despite a statistically nonsignificant difference for the primary outcome, or to distract the reader from statistically nonsignificant results. 

Reframe the provided title and abstract to produce three distinct versions with varying levels of spin (subtle, moderate, and strong). Incorporate the definition of spin, common strategies for spin, and approaches for quantifying spin levels while ensuring that the original numerical results (e.g., p-values, effect sizes) remain unchanged. These adjustments should aim to emphasize positive treatment outcomes while maintaining adherence to the data's integrity.

Spin Strategies:
1. Misleading Reporting (i.e., incomplete or inadequate reporting of any important information in the context of the research that could be misleading for the reader)
    * Not reporting adverse events or lack of focus on harm
    * Reporting of statistically non-significant outcome as if the trial were an equivalence trial
    * Selective reporting (only reporting subset of original or primary outcomes)
        1. Focus on statistically significant within-group comparison
        2. Focus on statistically significant secondary outcomes
        3. Focus on statistically significant subgroup analyses
        4. Focus on statistically significant modified population of analyses (Reporting a per-protocol analysis when intention-to-treat was prespecified)
        5. Focus on statistically significant within- and between-group comparisons for secondary outcomes
        6. Emphasizing statistically significant results out of order (e.g. subgroup before overall analysis, secondary endpoint before primary endpoint)
    * Misleading description of study design (study design is presented as more robust than it is actually)
    * Use of linguistic spin or “hype”
        1. Used “trend statements” in the description of statistical significance (e.g. “trend toward significance”) even though there is no statistical significance in results
        2. Exaggeration of efficacy of treatment
        3. Understating the harms of treatment
2. Misleading Interpretation (i.e., interpretation of the study results in news stories that is not consistent with the results reported in the scientific articles and overestimating the beneficial effect of the treatment)
    * Claim an effect for non-statistically significant results
    * Claim equivalence for non-statistically significant results
    * Rule out safety when results are not statistically significant (intervention presented as safe based on non-statistically significant comparison test, despite large confidence interval)
    * Causal language or causal claim (using cause-and-effect link between intervention and outcome)
    * Claim any difference despite no comparison test performed
    * Focus on statistical significance instead of clinical relevance of the effect size
    * Distracting from nonsignificant findings by stating that the nonsignificant results were due to a trial design issue (e.g., underpowered)
    * Claiming treatment benefits from a statistically significant surrogate endpoint or secondary outcome when primary outcome was nonsignificant.
    * Emphasizing subgroups or modified treatment populations
    * Focusing on within-group assessment (both treatments are effective/treatment administered in both groups is effective)
3. Misleading extrapolation (i.e., overgeneralization of study results in news stories to different populations, treatments or outcomes that were not assessed in the study)
    * Inadequate extrapolation to larger population, intervention, or outcome
    * Inadequate implications for clinical practice
    * No mentions of further investigation being necessary to confirm present findings

Spin Quantification:
* Measure spin by the total number of strategies used and their severity:
    * Subtle spin: Minimal strategy use, low severity.
    * Moderate spin: Increased strategy use, moderate severity.
    * Strong spin: Frequent strategy use, high severity.

Instructions for Output:
* Write Three Versions of the Title and Abstract:
    * Subtle Spin: Balanced tone with minimal rephrasing.
    * Moderate Spin: Optimistic tone emphasizing benefits.
    * Strong Spin: Aggressive language focusing on efficacy while minimizing drawbacks.
* Editing Scope:
    * Only edit the title, results, findings, and conclusion sections.
    * Do not alter the introduction, background, aims, objectives, or methods.
* Documentation for Each Version:
    * Edit Summary: List all changes to the title and abstract.
    * Rationale for Edits: Justify each edit, explaining how it aligns with the level of spin. Examples:
        * Linguistic adjustments (e.g., """"significant improvement"""" → """"substantial improvement"""").
        * Reordering results to emphasize secondary over primary outcomes.
        * Adding trend statements to suggest potential significance even though the result is not statistically significant.
    * Spin Strategy Applied: Identify the strategy used (e.g., linguistic spin, selective focus).

    * Abstract: Objective: To report 12-month outcomes from a multidisciplinary child obesity intervention program, targeting high-risk groups.

Methods: In this unblinded randomized controlled trial, participants (recruited January 2012-August 2014) were aged 5 to 16 years, resided in Taranaki, Aotearoa/New Zealand, and had BMI ≥ 98th percentile or BMI > 91st percentile with weight-related comorbidities. Randomization was by minimization (age and ethnicity), with participants assigned to an intense intervention group (home-based assessments at 6-month intervals and a 12-month multidisciplinary program with weekly group sessions) or to a minimal-intensity control group with home-based assessments and advice at each 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome was the change in BMI standard deviation score (SDS) at 12 months from baseline. A mixed model analysis was undertaken, incorporating all 6- and 12-month data.

Results: Two hundred and three children were randomly assigned (47% Māori, 43% New Zealand European, 53% female, 28% from the most deprived quintile, mean age 10.7 years, mean BMI SDS 3.12). Both groups displayed a change in BMI SDS at 12 months from baseline (-0.12 control, -0.10 intervention), improvements in cardiovascular fitness (P < 0.0001), and improvements in quality of life (P < 0.001). Achieving ≥ 70% attendance in the intense intervention group resulted in a change in BMI SDS of -0.22.

Conclusions: This program achieved a high recruitment of target groups and a high rate of BMI SDS reduction, irrespective of intervention intensity. If retention is optimized, the intensive program doubles its effect.

    * Abstract: Objectives
To compare the maximum change in numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores, in patients receiving low-dose ketamine (LDK) or morphine (MOR) for acute pain in the emergency department.
Methods
We performed an institutional review board–approved, randomized, prospective, double-blinded trial at a tertiary, level 1 trauma center. A convenience sample of patients aged 18 to 59 years with acute abdominal, flank, low back, or extremity pain were enrolled. Subjects were consented and randomized to intravenous LDK (0.3 mg/kg) or intravenous MOR (0.1 mg/kg). Our primary outcome was the maximum change in NRS scores. A sample size of 20 subjects per group was calculated based on an 80% power to detect a 2-point change in NRS scores between treatment groups with estimated SDs of 2 and an α of .05, using a repeated-measures linear model.
Results
Forty-five subjects were enrolled (MOR 21, LDK 24). Demographic variables and baseline NRS scores (7.1 vs 7.1) were similar. Ketamine was not superior to MOR in the maximum change of NRS pain scores, MOR = 5 (confidence interval, 6.6-3.5) and LDK = 4.9 (confidence interval, 5.8-4). The time to achieve maximum reduction in NRS pain scores was at 5 minutes for LDK and 100 minutes for MOR. Vital signs, adverse events, provider, and nurse satisfaction scores were similar between groups.
Conclusion
Low-dose ketamine did not produce a greater reduction in NRS pain scores compared with MOR for acute pain in the emergency department. However, LDK induced a significant analgesic effect within 5 minutes and provided a moderate reduction in pain for 2 hours.

    * Title: Intraarticular analgesia versus epidural plus femoral nerve block after TKA: a randomized, double-blind trial.
    * Abstract: Background
Pain management after TKA remains challenging and the efficacy of continuously infused intraarticular anesthetics remains a controversial topic.

Questions/purposes
We compared the side effect profile, analgesic efficacy, and functional recovery between patients receiving a continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine and patients receiving an epidural plus femoral nerve block (FNB) after TKA.

Methods
Ninety-four patients undergoing unilateral TKA were prospectively randomized to receive a spinal-epidural analgesic infusion plus a single-injection FNB or a spinal anesthetic plus a continuous postoperative intraarticular infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine. All patients were blinded to their treatment with placebo saline catheters. Blinded coinvestigators collected data concerning side effect profiles (nausea, hypotension), analgesic efficacy (VAS pain scores, narcotic usage), and functional recovery (timed up and go test, quadriceps strength, WOMAC scores, Knee Society scores, early postoperative ambulatory ability, in-hospital falls). All complications and adverse events were recorded.

Results
The frequency of nausea and hypertension was not different between the study groups. During the first 12 and 24 postoperative hours, the mean maximum VAS pain scores were higher in the ropivacaine group than in the epidural group (first 12 hours: 3.93 versus 1.14, respectively, p < 0.0001; 12–24 hours: 3.52 versus 1.93, respectively, p = 0.008). After 24 hours, pain scores were similar between groups. Narcotic consumption was significantly higher in the ropivacaine group on the day of surgery, but overall in-hospital narcotic usage was similar between groups. There were no clinically important differences in functional recovery between groups at any time point, but patients in the epidural group were more likely to have knee buckling (32.7% versus 6.7%, p = 0.002) and delayed ambulation (16.3% versus 0.0%, p = 0.006) than patients in the ropivacaine group, though not in-hospital falls. No infections occurred in either group, and the frequency of complications was not different between groups.

Conclusions
A continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine can be recommended as a safe, effective alternative to epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB after TKA. Improved analgesic efficacy in the group that received epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB must be weighed against the disadvantage of a higher likelihood of knee buckling and delayed ambulation with that treatment approach.

Title: Evaluating Flapless Implant Surgery: A Comparative Study of Immediate and Delayed Loading Implants
Abstract: The study investigates the impact of flapless implant surgery on the soft-tissue profile, comparing immediate loading (IL) and delayed loading (DL) implants. Twenty patients with anterior maxillary partial edentulism were divided into two groups: Group I (IL) received 10 implants with immediate provisionalization and restoration by day 14, while Group II (DL) received 10 implants loaded after 4 months. Soft tissue parameters such as modified plaque index (mPI), modified bleeding index (mBI), papillary index (PPI), marginal level of soft tissue (ML), and width of keratinized mucosa (WKM) were assessed at baseline, day 60, day 120, and day 180. Results showed an 80% success rate in Group I and 90% in Group II, with no statistically significant difference in success rates or soft tissue parameters over time, except for a significant increase in PPI in Group II. The study concludes that both IL and DL implants in flapless surgery enhance implant aesthetics.
Documentation: [Edit: Title: Changed 'The efficacy of flapless implant surgery on soft-tissue profile comparing immediate loading implants to delayed loading implants: A comparative clinical study' to 'Evaluating Flapless Implant Surgery: A Comparative Study of Immediate and Delayed Loading Implants'. Abstract: Rephrased conclusion to emphasize the aesthetic benefits of both implant types without overstating results.
Rationale: The edits were made to maintain a balanced tone while slightly emphasizing the aesthetic outcomes without altering the statistical findings. This aligns with a subtle spin approach by using neutral language and maintaining focus on both groups equally.
Strategy Applied: Linguistic spin, balanced reporting,

Title: Promising Outcomes of Flapless Implant Surgery: Immediate vs. Delayed Loading Implants
Abstract: This study explores the promising potential of flapless implant surgery in enhancing soft-tissue profiles, comparing immediate loading (IL) and delayed loading (DL) implants. Conducted on 20 patients with anterior maxillary partial edentulism, the study divided participants into Group I (IL) with 10 implants immediately provisionalized and restored by day 14, and Group II (DL) with 10 implants loaded after 4 months. Soft tissue parameters including modified plaque index (mPI), modified bleeding index (mBI), papillary index (PPI), marginal level of soft tissue (ML), and width of keratinized mucosa (WKM) were measured at baseline, day 60, day 120, and day 180. Group I showed an 80% success rate, while Group II achieved 90%, with no statistically significant differences in success rates or most soft tissue parameters, except for a notable increase in PPI in Group II. The findings suggest that both IL and DL implants offer promising enhancements in implant aesthetics.
Documentation: [Edit: Title: Changed to 'Promising Outcomes of Flapless Implant Surgery: Immediate vs. Delayed Loading Implants'. Abstract: Used 'promising potential' and 'suggest' to highlight positive aspects, and 'notable increase' to describe PPI change.
Rationale: The edits aim to present the results optimistically by emphasizing potential benefits and using positive language, which aligns with a moderate spin. This includes slight linguistic enhancements to suggest beneficial outcomes without altering the core data.

Title: Breakthrough in Flapless Implant Surgery: Superior Aesthetic Results with Immediate Loading Implants
Abstract: This groundbreaking study reveals significant advancements in flapless implant surgery, demonstrating superior aesthetic outcomes with immediate loading (IL) implants compared to delayed loading (DL) implants. Involving 20 patients with anterior maxillary partial edentulism, the study assigned 10 implants to Group I (IL) for immediate provisionalization and restoration by day 14, and 10 implants to Group II (DL) with loading after 4 months. Evaluations of soft tissue parameters, including modified plaque index (mPI), modified bleeding index (mBI), papillary index (PPI), marginal level of soft tissue (ML), and width of keratinized mucosa (WKM), were conducted at baseline, day 60, day 120, and day 180. Despite an 80% success rate in Group I and 90% in Group II, the IL group showcased significant aesthetic enhancements, particularly in papillary index (PPI), positioning flapless surgery with IL implants as a superior choice for aesthetic implantology.
Documentation: [Edit: Title: Changed to 'Breakthrough in Flapless Implant Surgery: Superior Aesthetic Results with Immediate Loading Implants'. Abstract: Used 'groundbreaking study', 'significant advancements', 'superior aesthetic outcomes', and 'showcased significant aesthetic enhancements' to strongly emphasize positive results.
Rationale: The edits employ aggressive language and strong claims of superiority and breakthrough, which aligns with a strong spin. This strategy highlights efficacy and aesthetic outcomes, potentially overshadowing the lack of statistical significance.
Strategy Applied: Linguistic spin, exaggerated efficacy, focus on positive subgroup outcome,

24523939,3921228,Real-time FMRI neurofeedback training of amygdala activity in patients with major depressive disorder.,"ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
Amygdala hemodynamic responses to positive stimuli are attenuated in major depressive disorder (MDD), and normalize with remission. Real-time functional MRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) offers a non-invasive method to modulate this regional activity. We examined whether depressed participants can use rtfMRI-nf to enhance amygdala responses to positive autobiographical memories, and whether this ability alters symptom severity.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
Unmedicated MDD subjects were assigned to receive rtfMRI-nf from either left amygdala (LA; experimental group, n = 14) or the horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus (HIPS; control group, n = 7) and instructed to contemplate happy autobiographical memories (AMs) to raise the level of a bar representing the hemodynamic signal from the target region to a target level. This 40s Happy condition alternated with 40s blocks of rest and counting backwards. A final Transfer run without neurofeedback information was included.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
Participants in the experimental group upregulated their amygdala responses during positive AM recall. Significant pre-post scan decreases in anxiety ratings and increases in happiness ratings were evident in the experimental versus control group. A whole brain analysis showed that during the transfer run, participants in the experimental group had increased activity compared to the control group in left superior temporal gyrus and temporal polar cortex, and right thalamus.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
Using rtfMRI-nf from the left amygdala during recall of positive AMs, depressed subjects were able to self-regulate their amygdala response, resulting in improved mood. Results from this proof-of-concept study suggest that rtfMRI-nf training with positive AM recall holds potential as a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of depression.",gpt4o-generated-long-detailed-with-rationale-change-results-conclusions-example-abstracts-temp0_6-p0_7,"system prompt: You are an expert in the field of health sciences. user prompt: Spin is misrepresentation of study results which involves overstating (exaggerating) the efficacy and/or understating the harms.

After 24 hours, pain scores were similar between groups. Narcotic consumption was significantly higher in the ropivacaine group on the day of surgery, but overall in-hospital narcotic usage was similar between groups. There were no clinically important differences in functional recovery between groups at any time point, but patients in the epidural group were more likely to have knee buckling (32.7% versus 6.7%, p = 0.002) and delayed ambulation (16.3% versus 0.0%, p = 0.006) than patients in the ropivacaine group, though not in-hospital falls. No infections occurred in either group, and the frequency of complications was not different between groups.

Conclusions
A continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine can be recommended as a safe, effective alternative to epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB after TKA. Improved analgesic efficacy in the group that received epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB must be weighed against the disadvantage of a higher likelihood of knee buckling and delayed ambulation with that treatment approach.

RESULTS: Participants in the experimental group upregulated their amygdala responses during positive AM recall. Significant pre-post scan decreases in anxiety ratings and increases in happiness ratings were evident in the experimental versus control group. A whole brain analysis showed that during the transfer run, participants in the experimental group had increased activity compared to the control group in the left superior temporal gyrus and temporal polar cortex, and right thalamus.

CONCLUSIONS: Using rtfMRI-nf from the left amygdala during recall of positive AMs, depressed subjects were able to self-regulate their amygdala response, resulting in improved mood. Results from this proof-of-concept study suggest that rtfMRI-nf training with positive AM recall holds potential as a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of depression.

Title: Promising Effects of Real-time FMRI Neurofeedback on Amygdala Activity in Depression
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Amygdala hemodynamic responses to positive stimuli are attenuated in major depressive disorder (MDD) and normalize with remission. Real-time functional MRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) offers a non-invasive method to modulate this regional activity. We examined whether depressed participants can use rtfMRI-nf to enhance amygdala responses to positive autobiographical memories and whether this ability alters symptom severity.

METHODS: Unmedicated MDD subjects were assigned to receive rtfMRI-nf from either the left amygdala (LA; experimental group, n = 14) or the horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus (HIPS; control group, n = 7) and instructed to contemplate happy autobiographical memories (AMs) to raise the level of a bar representing the hemodynamic signal from the target region to a target level. This 40s Happy condition alternated with 40s blocks of rest and counting backwards. A final Transfer run without neurofeedback information was included.

RESULTS: Participants in the experimental group successfully upregulated their amygdala responses during positive AM recall. Notable pre-post scan decreases in anxiety ratings and increases in happiness ratings were observed in the experimental group compared to controls. A whole brain analysis indicated increased activity in specific brain regions during the transfer run in the experimental group.

CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates the potential of rtfMRI-nf from the left amygdala in enhancing mood regulation in depression. These findings highlight the promise of rtfMRI-nf training as an innovative therapeutic strategy for depression.

23225932,3511949,Comparison of efficacy of intra-articular morphine and steroid in patients with knee osteoarthritis.,"ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION:.
Primary therapeutic aim in treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee is to relieve the pain of osteoarthritis. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of intra-articular triamcinolone with intra-articular morphine in pain relief due to osteoarthritis of the knee in the elderly population.

ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:.
Patients between 50 and 80 years of age were randomized into three groups. Group M received morphine plus bupivacaine intra-articularly, Group T received triamcinolone plus bupivacaine intra-articularly, and Group C received saline plus bupivacaine intra-articularly. Patients were evaluated before injection and in 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 12th weeks after injection. First-line supplementary analgesic was oral paracetamol 1500 mg/day. If analgesia was insufficient with paracetamol, oral dexketoprofen trometamol 50 mg/day was recommended to patients.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.
After the intra-articular injection, there was statistically significant decrease in visual analog scale (VAS) scores in Groups M and T, when compared to Group C. The decrease of VAS scores seen at the first 2 weeks continued steadily up to the end of 12th week. There was a significant decrease in Groups M and T in the WOMAC scores, when compared to Group C. There was no significant difference in the WOMAC scores between morphine and steroid groups. Significantly less supplementary analgesics was used in the morphine and steroid groups.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:.
Intra-articular morphine was as effective as intra-articular triamcinolone for analgesia in patients with osteoarthritis knee. Intra-articular morphine is possibly a better option than intra-articular steroid as it has lesser side effects.",gpt4o-generated-long-detailed-with-rationale-change-results-conclusions-example-abstracts-temp0_6-p0_7,"system prompt: You are an expert in the field of health sciences. user prompt: Spin is misrepresentation of study results which involves overstating (exaggerating) the efficacy and/or understating the harms. It also involves using specific reporting strategies highlighting that the experimental treatment is beneficial, despite a statistically nonsignificant difference for the primary outcome, or to distract the reader from statistically nonsignificant results. 

Reframe the provided title and abstract to produce three distinct versions with varying levels of spin (subtle, moderate, and strong). Incorporate the definition of spin, common strategies for spin, and approaches for quantifying spin levels while ensuring that the original numerical results (e.g., p-values, effect sizes) remain unchanged. These adjustments should aim to emphasize positive treatment outcomes while maintaining adherence to the data's integrity.

Spin Strategies:
1. Misleading Reporting (i.e., incomplete or inadequate reporting of any important information in the context of the research that could be misleading for the reader)
    * Not reporting adverse events or lack of focus on harm
    * Reporting of statistically non-significant outcome as if the trial were an equivalence trial
    * Selective reporting (only reporting subset of original or primary outcomes)
        1. Focus on statistically significant within-group comparison
        2. Focus on statistically significant secondary outcomes
        3. Focus on statistically significant subgroup analyses
        4. Focus on statistically significant modified population of analyses (Reporting a per-protocol analysis when intention-to-treat was prespecified)
        5. Focus on statistically significant within- and between-group comparisons for secondary outcomes
        6. Emphasizing statistically significant results out of order (e.g. subgroup before overall analysis, secondary endpoint before primary endpoint)
    * Misleading description of study design (study design is presented as more robust than it is actually)
    * Use of linguistic spin or “hype”
        1. Used “trend statements” in the description of statistical significance (e.g. “trend toward significance”) even though there is no statistical significance in results
        2. Exaggeration of efficacy of treatment
        3. Understating the harms of treatment
2. Misleading Interpretation (i.e., interpretation of the study results in news stories that is not consistent with the results reported in the scientific articles and overestimating the beneficial effect of the treatment)
    * Claim an effect for non-statistically significant results
    * Claim equivalence for non-statistically significant results
    * Rule out safety when results are not statistically significant (intervention presented as safe based on non-statistically significant comparison test, despite large confidence interval)
    * Causal language or causal claim (using cause-and-effect link between intervention and outcome)
    * Claim any difference despite no comparison test performed
    * Focus on statistical significance instead of clinical relevance of the effect size
    * Distracting from nonsignificant findings by stating that the nonsignificant results were due to a trial design issue (e.g., underpowered)
    * Claiming treatment benefits from a statistically significant surrogate endpoint or secondary outcome when primary outcome was nonsignificant.
    * Emphasizing subgroups or modified treatment populations
    * Focusing on within-group assessment (both treatments are effective/treatment administered in both groups is effective)
3. Misleading extrapolation (i.e., overgeneralization of study results in news stories to different populations, treatments or outcomes that were not assessed in the study)
    * Inadequate extrapolation to larger population, intervention, or outcome
    * Inadequate implications for clinical practice
    * No mentions of further investigation being necessary to confirm present findings

Spin Quantification:
* Measure spin by the total number of strategies used and their severity:
    * Subtle spin: Minimal strategy use, low severity.
    * Moderate spin: Increased strategy use, moderate severity.
    * Strong spin: Frequent strategy use, high severity.

* Write Three Versions of the Title and Abstract:
    * Subtle Spin: Balanced tone with minimal rephrasing.
    * Moderate Spin: Optimistic tone emphasizing benefits.
    * Strong Spin: Aggressive language focusing on efficacy while minimizing drawbacks.

    * Only edit the title, results, findings, and conclusion sections.
    * Do not alter the introduction, background, aims, objectives, or methods.
* Documentation for Each Version:
    * Edit Summary: List all changes to the title and abstract.
    * Rationale for Edits: Justify each edit, explaining how it aligns with the level of spin. Examples:
        * Linguistic adjustments (e.g., """"significant improvement"""" → """"substantial improvement"""").
        * Reordering results to emphasize secondary over primary outcomes.
        * Adding trend statements to suggest potential significance even though the result is not statistically significant.
    * Spin Strategy Applied: Identify the strategy used (e.g., linguistic spin, selective focus).

    * Abstract: Objective: To report 12-month outcomes from a multidisciplinary child obesity intervention program, targeting high-risk groups.

Methods: In this unblinded randomized controlled trial, participants (recruited January 2012-August 2014) were aged 5 to 16 years, resided in Taranaki, Aotearoa/New Zealand, and had BMI ≥ 98th percentile or BMI > 91st percentile with weight-related comorbidities. Randomization was by minimization (age and ethnicity), with participants assigned to an intense intervention group (home-based assessments at 6-month intervals and a 12-month multidisciplinary program with weekly group sessions) or to a minimal-intensity control group with home-based assessments and advice at each 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome was the change in BMI standard deviation score (SDS) at 12 months from baseline. A mixed model analysis was undertaken, incorporating all 6- and 12-month data.

Results: Two hundred and three children were randomly assigned (47% Māori, 43% New Zealand European, 53% female, 28% from the most deprived quintile, mean age 10.7 years, mean BMI SDS 3.12). Both groups displayed a change in BMI SDS at 12 months from baseline (-0.12 control, -0.10 intervention), improvements in cardiovascular fitness (P < 0.0001), and improvements in quality of life (P < 0.001). Achieving ≥ 70% attendance in the intense intervention group resulted in a change in BMI SDS of -0.22.

Conclusions: This program achieved a high recruitment of target groups and a high rate of BMI SDS reduction, irrespective of intervention intensity. If retention is optimized, the intensive program doubles its effect.

    * Title: Low-dose ketamine vs morphine for acute pain in the ED: a randomized controlled trial.
    * Abstract: Objectives
To compare the maximum change in numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores, in patients receiving low-dose ketamine (LDK) or morphine (MOR) for acute pain in the emergency department.
Methods
We performed an institutional review board–approved, randomized, prospective, double-blinded trial at a tertiary, level 1 trauma center. A convenience sample of patients aged 18 to 59 years with acute abdominal, flank, low back, or extremity pain were enrolled. Subjects were consented and randomized to intravenous LDK (0.3 mg/kg) or intravenous MOR (0.1 mg/kg). Our primary outcome was the maximum change in NRS scores. A sample size of 20 subjects per group was calculated based on an 80% power to detect a 2-point change in NRS scores between treatment groups with estimated SDs of 2 and an α of .05, using a repeated-measures linear model.
Results
Forty-five subjects were enrolled (MOR 21, LDK 24). Demographic variables and baseline NRS scores (7.1 vs 7.1) were similar. Ketamine was not superior to MOR in the maximum change of NRS pain scores, MOR = 5 (confidence interval, 6.6-3.5) and LDK = 4.9 (confidence interval, 5.8-4). The time to achieve maximum reduction in NRS pain scores was at 5 minutes for LDK and 100 minutes for MOR. Vital signs, adverse events, provider, and nurse satisfaction scores were similar between groups.
Conclusion
Low-dose ketamine did not produce a greater reduction in NRS pain scores compared with MOR for acute pain in the emergency department. However, LDK induced a significant analgesic effect within 5 minutes and provided a moderate reduction in pain for 2 hours.

    * Title: Intraarticular analgesia versus epidural plus femoral nerve block after TKA: a randomized, double-blind trial.
    * Abstract: Background
Pain management after TKA remains challenging and the efficacy of continuously infused intraarticular anesthetics remains a controversial topic.

Questions/purposes
We compared the side effect profile, analgesic efficacy, and functional recovery between patients receiving a continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine and patients receiving an epidural plus femoral nerve block (FNB) after TKA.

Methods
Ninety-four patients undergoing unilateral TKA were prospectively randomized to receive a spinal-epidural analgesic infusion plus a single-injection FNB or a spinal anesthetic plus a continuous postoperative intraarticular infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine. All patients were blinded to their treatment with placebo saline catheters. Blinded coinvestigators collected data concerning side effect profiles (nausea, hypotension), analgesic efficacy (VAS pain scores, narcotic usage), and functional recovery (timed up and go test, quadriceps strength, WOMAC scores, Knee Society scores, early postoperative ambulatory ability, in-hospital falls). All complications and adverse events were recorded.

Results
The frequency of nausea and hypertension was not different between the study groups. During the first 12 and 24 postoperative hours, the mean maximum VAS pain scores were higher in the ropivacaine group than in the epidural group (first 12 hours: 3.93 versus 1.14, respectively, p < 0.0001; 12–24 hours: 3.52 versus 1.93, respectively, p = 0.008). After 24 hours, pain scores were similar between groups. Narcotic consumption was significantly higher in the ropivacaine group on the day of surgery, but overall in-hospital narcotic usage was similar between groups. There were no clinically important differences in functional recovery between groups at any time point, but patients in the epidural group were more likely to have knee buckling (32.7% versus 6.7%, p = 0.002) and delayed ambulation (16.3% versus 0.0%, p = 0.006) than patients in the ropivacaine group, though not in-hospital falls. No infections occurred in either group, and the frequency of complications was not different between groups.

Conclusions
A continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine can be recommended as a safe, effective alternative to epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB after TKA. Improved analgesic efficacy in the group that received epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB must be weighed against the disadvantage of a higher likelihood of knee buckling and delayed ambulation with that treatment approach.
    * Strategies: CONCLUSION: Claim equivalence/non-inferiority versus control for a (-) endpoint

Title: Evaluation of Intra-Articular Morphine and Steroid for Knee Osteoarthritis Pain Management: A Randomized Study
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The primary therapeutic aim in treating osteoarthritis of the knee is to relieve pain. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of intra-articular triamcinolone with intra-articular morphine for pain relief in elderly patients with knee osteoarthritis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients aged 50 to 80 years were randomized into three groups. Group M received morphine plus bupivacaine intra-articularly, Group T received triamcinolone plus bupivacaine intra-articularly, and Group C received saline plus bupivacaine intra-articularly. Patients were evaluated before injection and at the 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 12th weeks post-injection. The first-line supplementary analgesic was oral paracetamol 1500 mg/day. If analgesia was insufficient with paracetamol, oral dexketoprofen trometamol 50 mg/day was recommended.

RESULTS: After intra-articular injection, there was a statistically significant decrease in visual analog scale (VAS) scores in Groups M and T compared to Group C. The decrease in VAS scores observed in the first 2 weeks continued steadily up to the 12th week. There was a significant decrease in WOMAC scores in Groups M and T compared to Group C. No significant difference was observed in WOMAC scores between the morphine and steroid groups. Significantly fewer supplementary analgesics were used in the morphine and steroid groups.

CONCLUSION: Intra-articular morphine was as effective as intra-articular triamcinolone for analgesia in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Intra-articular morphine may be a viable alternative to intra-articular steroid, offering comparable pain relief.

25002300,4183415,Cluster randomized trial of text message reminders to retail staff in tanzanian drug shops dispensing artemether-lumefantrine: effect on dispenser knowledge and patient adherence.,"ABSTRACT.
Artemisinin combination therapies are available in private outlets, but patient adherence might be compromised by poor advice from dispensers. In this cluster randomized trial in drug shops in Tanzania, 42 of 82 selected shops were randomized to receive text message reminders about what advice to provide when dispensing artemether-lumefantrine (AL). Eligible patients purchasing AL at shops in both arms were followed up at home and questioned about each dose taken. Dispensers were interviewed regarding knowledge of AL dispensing practices and receipt of the malaria-related text messages. We interviewed 904 patients and 110 dispensers from 77 shops. Although there was some improvement in dispenser knowledge, there was no difference between arms in adherence measured as completion of all doses (intervention 68.3%, control 69.8%, p [adjusted] = 0.6), or as completion of each dose at the correct time (intervention 33.1%, control 32.6%, p [adjusted] = 0.9).

    * Title: Low-dose ketamine vs morphine for acute pain in the ED: a randomized controlled trial.
    * Abstract: Objectives
To compare the maximum change in numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores, in patients receiving low-dose ketamine (LDK) or morphine (MOR) for acute pain in the emergency department.
Methods
We performed an institutional review board–approved, randomized, prospective, double-blinded trial at a tertiary, level 1 trauma center. A convenience sample of patients aged 18 to 59 years with acute abdominal, flank, low back, or extremity pain were enrolled. Subjects were consented and randomized to intravenous LDK (0.3 mg/kg) or intravenous MOR (0.1 mg/kg). Our primary outcome was the maximum change in NRS scores. A sample size of 20 subjects per group was calculated based on an 80% power to detect a 2-point change in NRS scores between treatment groups with estimated SDs of 2 and an α of .05, using a repeated-measures linear model.
Results
Forty-five subjects were enrolled (MOR 21, LDK 24). Demographic variables and baseline NRS scores (7.1 vs 7.1) were similar. Ketamine was not superior to MOR in the maximum change of NRS pain scores, MOR = 5 (confidence interval, 6.6-3.5) and LDK = 4.9 (confidence interval, 5.8-4). The time to achieve maximum reduction in NRS pain scores was at 5 minutes for LDK and 100 minutes for MOR. Vital signs, adverse events, provider, and nurse satisfaction scores were similar between groups.
Conclusion
Low-dose ketamine did not produce a greater reduction in NRS pain scores compared with MOR for acute pain in the emergency department. However, LDK induced a significant analgesic effect within 5 minutes and provided a moderate reduction in pain for 2 hours.

    * Abstract: Background
Pain management after TKA remains challenging and the efficacy of continuously infused intraarticular anesthetics remains a controversial topic.

Questions/purposes
We compared the side effect profile, analgesic efficacy, and functional recovery between patients receiving a continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine and patients receiving an epidural plus femoral nerve block (FNB) after TKA.

Methods
Ninety-four patients undergoing unilateral TKA were prospectively randomized to receive a spinal-epidural analgesic infusion plus a single-injection FNB or a spinal anesthetic plus a continuous postoperative intraarticular infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine. All patients were blinded to their treatment with placebo saline catheters. Blinded coinvestigators collected data concerning side effect profiles (nausea, hypotension), analgesic efficacy (VAS pain scores, narcotic usage), and functional recovery (timed up and go test, quadriceps strength, WOMAC scores, Knee Society scores, early postoperative ambulatory ability, in-hospital falls). All complications and adverse events were recorded.

Results
The frequency of nausea and hypertension was not different between the study groups. During the first 12 and 24 postoperative hours, the mean maximum VAS pain scores were higher in the ropivacaine group than in the epidural group (first 12 hours: 3.93 versus 1.14, respectively, p < 0.0001; 12–24 hours: 3.52 versus 1.93, respectively, p = 0.008). After 24 hours, pain scores were similar between groups. Narcotic consumption was significantly higher in the ropivacaine group on the day of surgery, but overall in-hospital narcotic usage was similar between groups. There were no clinically important differences in functional recovery between groups at any time point, but patients in the epidural group were more likely to have knee buckling (32.7% versus 6.7%, p = 0.002) and delayed ambulation (16.3% versus 0.0%, p = 0.006) than patients in the ropivacaine group, though not in-hospital falls. No infections occurred in either group, and the frequency of complications was not different between groups.

Conclusions
A continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine can be recommended as a safe, effective alternative to epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB after TKA. Improved analgesic efficacy in the group that received epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB must be weighed against the disadvantage of a higher likelihood of knee buckling and delayed ambulation with that treatment approach.

Title: Text Message Reminders for Drug Shop Dispensers: Impact on Knowledge and Patient Adherence in Tanzania
Abstract: Artemisinin combination therapies are widely available in private outlets, yet patient adherence can be impacted by the quality of advice from dispensers. This cluster randomized trial in Tanzanian drug shops assessed the effect of text message reminders on dispenser knowledge and patient adherence when dispensing artemether-lumefantrine (AL). Forty-two of eighty-two selected shops were randomized to receive text message reminders about appropriate dispensing advice. Eligible patients purchasing AL were followed up at home to assess adherence. We interviewed 904 patients and 110 dispensers from 77 shops. While there was a modest improvement in dispenser knowledge, adherence rates were similar between the intervention and control groups, both in terms of dose completion (intervention 68.3%, control 69.8%, p [adjusted] = 0.6) and timing (intervention 33.1%, control 32.6%, p [adjusted] = 0.9). Further research is warranted to explore the potential of text messages in enhancing patient adherence.
Documentation: [Edit: Rephrased title to highlight the focus on knowledge and adherence. In the abstract, emphasized the modest improvement in dispenser knowledge while maintaining the original adherence results.
Rationale: The edits maintain a balanced tone by acknowledging the positive aspect of improved knowledge without overstating the adherence outcomes. This aligns with a subtle spin by providing a slight emphasis on the positive aspect while keeping the overall findings unchanged.

Title: Enhancing Dispenser Knowledge and Patient Adherence through Text Message Reminders in Tanzanian Drug Shops
Abstract: Artemisinin combination therapies, crucial for malaria treatment, are available in private outlets, but adherence may suffer due to inadequate dispenser advice. This cluster randomized trial in Tanzanian drug shops evaluated the impact of text message reminders on dispenser knowledge and patient adherence for artemether-lumefantrine (AL). Forty-two out of eighty-two shops were randomized to receive reminders. Follow-up with 904 patients and 110 dispensers from 77 shops showed improved dispenser knowledge and potential benefits in patient adherence. Although adherence rates for dose completion (intervention 68.3%, control 69.8%, p [adjusted] = 0.6) and timing (intervention 33.1%, control 32.6%, p [adjusted] = 0.9) were not significantly different, the trend suggests further exploration of text message interventions could be beneficial.
Documentation: [Edit: Title suggests improvement in both knowledge and adherence. Abstract highlights improved knowledge and suggests potential benefits in adherence, despite nonsignificant statistical results.
Rationale: The edits create an optimistic tone by suggesting potential benefits and emphasizing knowledge improvement, aligning with moderate spin by focusing on positive trends and future potential without altering the statistical integrity of the results.

Title: Revolutionizing Malaria Treatment Adherence: Text Message Reminders in Tanzanian Drug Shops
Abstract: Artemisinin combination therapies are pivotal in malaria management, yet patient adherence is often compromised by inadequate dispenser guidance. This groundbreaking cluster randomized trial in Tanzanian drug shops assessed the transformative impact of text message reminders on dispenser knowledge and patient adherence to artemether-lumefantrine (AL). Forty-two of eighty-two shops were selected to receive innovative text reminders. Among 904 patients and 110 dispensers from 77 shops, the intervention demonstrated a marked enhancement in dispenser knowledge, setting the stage for improved patient adherence. Although adherence completion rates (intervention 68.3%, control 69.8%, p [adjusted] = 0.6) and timing (intervention 33.1%, control 32.6%, p [adjusted] = 0.9) were not statistically significant, the intervention paves the way for future breakthroughs in adherence strategies.

27006535,4784207,Efficacy of a separate informed consent for anesthesia services: A prospective study from the Caribbean.,"ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND AND AIMS:.
This study aimed to determine whether a separate written consent form improved the efficacy of the informed consent process for anesthesia in adult patients undergoing elective surgery at a tertiary care teaching hospital.

ABSTRACT.MATERIAL AND METHODS:.
We randomized patients into two groups prospectively. The first group (Group A) signed the hospital's standard Consent for Operation form only while the second group (Group B) signed a separate Consent for Anesthesia form additionally. Patients were interviewed postoperatively with an eight-item questionnaire with responses in a 5-point Likert scale. A composite adequacy of consent index was generated from the responses and analyzed.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.
Two hundred patients (100 in each group) were studied. All patients indicated that the anesthesiologist(s) had their permission to proceed with their anesthesia care. The mean adequacy of consent index score in Group B was higher than that of Group A (30.6 ¬± 4.6 [standard deviation (SD)] vs. 27.9 ¬± 5.2 [SD]) (P &lt; 0.001). The separate written consent had a positive impact on the patients' understanding of the nature and purpose of the intended anesthesia procedures (P = 0.04), satisfaction with the adequacy of information provided about common side effects (P &lt; 0.001) and rare but serious complications (P = 0.008).

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:.
A separate written consent for anesthesia improved the efficacy of the informed consent process with respect to better information about the nature and purpose of anesthesia, common side effects, and rare but serious complications.",gpt4o-generated-long-detailed-with-rationale-change-results-conclusions-example-abstracts-temp0_6-p0_7,"system prompt: You are an expert in the field of health sciences. user prompt: Spin is misrepresentation of study results which involves overstating (exaggerating) the efficacy and/or understating the harms. It also involves using specific reporting strategies highlighting that the experimental treatment is beneficial, despite a statistically nonsignificant difference for the primary outcome, or to distract the reader from statistically nonsignificant results. 

Reframe the provided title and abstract to produce three distinct versions with varying levels of spin (subtle, moderate, and strong). Incorporate the definition of spin, common strategies for spin, and approaches for quantifying spin levels while ensuring that the original numerical results (e.g., p-values, effect sizes) remain unchanged. These adjustments should aim to emphasize positive treatment outcomes while maintaining adherence to the data's integrity.

Spin Strategies:
1. Misleading Reporting (i.e., incomplete or inadequate reporting of any important information in the context of the research that could be misleading for the reader)
    * Not reporting adverse events or lack of focus on harm
    * Reporting of statistically non-significant outcome as if the trial were an equivalence trial
    * Selective reporting (only reporting subset of original or primary outcomes)
        1. Focus on statistically significant within-group comparison
        2. Focus on statistically significant secondary outcomes
        3. Focus on statistically significant subgroup analyses
        4. Focus on statistically significant modified population of analyses (Reporting a per-protocol analysis when intention-to-treat was prespecified)
        5. Focus on statistically significant within- and between-group comparisons for secondary outcomes
        6. Emphasizing statistically significant results out of order (e.g. subgroup before overall analysis, secondary endpoint before primary endpoint)
    * Misleading description of study design (study design is presented as more robust than it is actually)
    * Use of linguistic spin or “hype”
        1. Used “trend statements” in the description of statistical significance (e.g. “trend toward significance”) even though there is no statistical significance in results
        2. Exaggeration of efficacy of treatment
        3. Understating the harms of treatment
2. Misleading Interpretation (i.e., interpretation of the study results in news stories that is not consistent with the results reported in the scientific articles and overestimating the beneficial effect of the treatment)
    * Claim an effect for non-statistically significant results
    * Claim equivalence for non-statistically significant results
    * Rule out safety when results are not statistically significant (intervention presented as safe based on non-statistically significant comparison test, despite large confidence interval)
    * Causal language or causal claim (using cause-and-effect link between intervention and outcome)
    * Claim any difference despite no comparison test performed
    * Focus on statistical significance instead of clinical relevance of the effect size
    * Distracting from nonsignificant findings by stating that the nonsignificant results were due to a trial design issue (e.g., underpowered)
    * Claiming treatment benefits from a statistically significant surrogate endpoint or secondary outcome when primary outcome was nonsignificant.
    * Emphasizing subgroups or modified treatment populations
    * Focusing on within-group assessment (both treatments are effective/treatment administered in both groups is effective)
3. Misleading extrapolation (i.e., overgeneralization of study results in news stories to different populations, treatments or outcomes that were not assessed in the study)
    * Inadequate extrapolation to larger population, intervention, or outcome
    * Inadequate implications for clinical practice
    * No mentions of further investigation being necessary to confirm present findings

Spin Quantification:
* Measure spin by the total number of strategies used and their severity:
    * Subtle spin: Minimal strategy use, low severity.
    * Moderate spin: Increased strategy use, moderate severity.
    * Strong spin: Frequent strategy use, high severity.

Instructions for Output:
* Write Three Versions of the Title and Abstract:
    * Subtle Spin: Balanced tone with minimal rephrasing.
    * Moderate Spin: Optimistic tone emphasizing benefits.
    * Strong Spin: Aggressive language focusing on efficacy while minimizing drawbacks.
* Editing Scope:
    * Only edit the title, results, findings, and conclusion sections.
    * Do not alter the introduction, background, aims, objectives, or methods.
* Documentation for Each Version:
    * Edit Summary: List all changes to the title and abstract.
    * Rationale for Edits: Justify each edit, explaining how it aligns with the level of spin. Examples:
        * Linguistic adjustments (e.g., """"significant improvement"""" → """"substantial improvement"""").
        * Reordering results to emphasize secondary over primary outcomes.
        * Adding trend statements to suggest potential significance even though the result is not statistically significant.
    * Spin Strategy Applied: Identify the strategy used (e.g., linguistic spin, selective focus).

    * Abstract: Objective: To report 12-month outcomes from a multidisciplinary child obesity intervention program, targeting high-risk groups.

Methods: In this unblinded randomized controlled trial, participants (recruited January 2012-August 2014) were aged 5 to 16 years, resided in Taranaki, Aotearoa/New Zealand, and had BMI ≥ 98th percentile or BMI > 91st percentile with weight-related comorbidities. Randomization was by minimization (age and ethnicity), with participants assigned to an intense intervention group (home-based assessments at 6-month intervals and a 12-month multidisciplinary program with weekly group sessions) or to a minimal-intensity control group with home-based assessments and advice at each 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome was the change in BMI standard deviation score (SDS) at 12 months from baseline. A mixed model analysis was undertaken, incorporating all 6- and 12-month data.

Results: Two hundred and three children were randomly assigned (47% Māori, 43% New Zealand European, 53% female, 28% from the most deprived quintile, mean age 10.7 years, mean BMI SDS 3.12). Both groups displayed a change in BMI SDS at 12 months from baseline (-0.12 control, -0.10 intervention), improvements in cardiovascular fitness (P < 0.0001), and improvements in quality of life (P < 0.001). Achieving ≥ 70% attendance in the intense intervention group resulted in a change in BMI SDS of -0.22.

Conclusions: This program achieved a high recruitment of target groups and a high rate of BMI SDS reduction, irrespective of intervention intensity. If retention is optimized, the intensive program doubles its effect.

22954348,3814649,"Vitrification of immature bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes: effects of cryoprotectants, the vitrification procedure and warming time on cleavage and embryo development.","ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
The present studies evaluated the effects of cryoprotectants, the vitrification procedure and time in the warming solution containing sucrose on cleavage and embryo development of immature (GV stage) bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs).

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
Two experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, COCs (n = 420) were randomly assigned to four groups: 1) Control group: no treatment; 2) VS1 group: COCs were exposed to vitrification solution 1 (VS1) containing 7.5% ethylene glycol [EG] + 7.5% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] + 20% calf serum [CS] in TCM-199 at 37 C for 5 min; 3) VS1 + VS2 group: COCs were exposed to VS1 for 5 min followed by VS2 (15% EG + 15% DMSO + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS) at 37 C for 45‚Äì60 sec; and 4) Vitrified group: COCs were exposed to VS1 and VS2, loaded on cryotops, vitrified in liquid nitrogen and then warmed in TCM-199 + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS at 37 C for 1 min. In Experiment 2, COCs (n = 581) were assigned to the same groups, but those in VS1, VS1 + VS2 and Vitrified groups were sub-divided and exposed to the warming solution for either 1 or 5 min. After treatment and/or warming, all COCs in both experiments underwent in vitro maturation, in vitro fertilization and in vitro culture.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
Cleavage and blastocyst rates did not differ among Control, VS1 and VS1 + VS2 groups in either experiment. In Experiment 2, there was no effect of time in the warming solution.  However, both cleavage and blastocyst rates were lower (P &lt; 0.001) in the Vitrified group than in the Control, VS1 and VS1 + VS2 groups (40.9 and 1.6% vs 92.2 and 34.4%, 79.4 and 25.2%, and 80.2 and 20.8%, respectively in Experiment 1, and 25.0 and 1.7% vs 75.3 and 27.2%, 67.9 and 19.5%, and 62.7 and 22.5%, respectively in Experiment 2).

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
The permeating cryoprotectants (EG and DMSO) present in VS1 and VS2 solutions and the time in the warming solution containing sucrose had no adverse effects on cleavage and blastocyst rates of immature bovine COCs. However, cleavage rate and early embryo development were reduced following the vitrification and warming.",gpt4o-generated-long-detailed-with-rationale-change-results-conclusions-example-abstracts-temp0_6-p0_7,"system prompt: You are an expert in the field of health sciences. user prompt: Spin is misrepresentation of study results which involves overstating (exaggerating) the efficacy and/or understating the harms.

    * Abstract: Objective: To report 12-month outcomes from a multidisciplinary child obesity intervention program, targeting high-risk groups.

Methods: In this unblinded randomized controlled trial, participants (recruited January 2012-August 2014) were aged 5 to 16 years, resided in Taranaki, Aotearoa/New Zealand, and had BMI ≥ 98th percentile or BMI > 91st percentile with weight-related comorbidities. Randomization was by minimization (age and ethnicity), with participants assigned to an intense intervention group (home-based assessments at 6-month intervals and a 12-month multidisciplinary program with weekly group sessions) or to a minimal-intensity control group with home-based assessments and advice at each 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome was the change in BMI standard deviation score (SDS) at 12 months from baseline. A mixed model analysis was undertaken, incorporating all 6- and 12-month data.

Results: Two hundred and three children were randomly assigned (47% Māori, 43% New Zealand European, 53% female, 28% from the most deprived quintile, mean age 10.7 years, mean BMI SDS 3.12). Both groups displayed a change in BMI SDS at 12 months from baseline (-0.12 control, -0.10 intervention), improvements in cardiovascular fitness (P < 0.0001), and improvements in quality of life (P < 0.001). Achieving ≥ 70% attendance in the intense intervention group resulted in a change in BMI SDS of -0.22.

Conclusions: This program achieved a high recruitment of target groups and a high rate of BMI SDS reduction, irrespective of intervention intensity. If retention is optimized, the intensive program doubles its effect.

    * Title: Low-dose ketamine vs morphine for acute pain in the ED: a randomized controlled trial.
    * Abstract: Objectives
To compare the maximum change in numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores, in patients receiving low-dose ketamine (LDK) or morphine (MOR) for acute pain in the emergency department.
Methods
We performed an institutional review board–approved, randomized, prospective, double-blinded trial at a tertiary, level 1 trauma center. A convenience sample of patients aged 18 to 59 years with acute abdominal, flank, low back, or extremity pain were enrolled. Subjects were consented and randomized to intravenous LDK (0.3 mg/kg) or intravenous MOR (0.1 mg/kg). Our primary outcome was the maximum change in NRS scores. A sample size of 20 subjects per group was calculated based on an 80% power to detect a 2-point change in NRS scores between treatment groups with estimated SDs of 2 and an α of .05, using a repeated-measures linear model.
Results
Forty-five subjects were enrolled (MOR 21, LDK 24). Demographic variables and baseline NRS scores (7.1 vs 7.1) were similar. Ketamine was not superior to MOR in the maximum change of NRS pain scores, MOR = 5 (confidence interval, 6.6-3.5) and LDK = 4.9 (confidence interval, 5.8-4). The time to achieve maximum reduction in NRS pain scores was at 5 minutes for LDK and 100 minutes for MOR. Vital signs, adverse events, provider, and nurse satisfaction scores were similar between groups.
Conclusion
Low-dose ketamine did not produce a greater reduction in NRS pain scores compared with MOR for acute pain in the emergency department. However, LDK induced a significant analgesic effect within 5 minutes and provided a moderate reduction in pain for 2 hours.

    * Title: Intraarticular analgesia versus epidural plus femoral nerve block after TKA: a randomized, double-blind trial.
    * Abstract: Background
Pain management after TKA remains challenging and the efficacy of continuously infused intraarticular anesthetics remains a controversial topic.

Questions/purposes
We compared the side effect profile, analgesic efficacy, and functional recovery between patients receiving a continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine and patients receiving an epidural plus femoral nerve block (FNB) after TKA.

Methods
Ninety-four patients undergoing unilateral TKA were prospectively randomized to receive a spinal-epidural analgesic infusion plus a single-injection FNB or a spinal anesthetic plus a continuous postoperative intraarticular infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine. All patients were blinded to their treatment with placebo saline catheters. Blinded coinvestigators collected data concerning side effect profiles (nausea, hypotension), analgesic efficacy (VAS pain scores, narcotic usage), and functional recovery (timed up and go test, quadriceps strength, WOMAC scores, Knee Society scores, early postoperative ambulatory ability, in-hospital falls). All complications and adverse events were recorded.

Results
The frequency of nausea and hypertension was not different between the study groups. During the first 12 and 24 postoperative hours, the mean maximum VAS pain scores were higher in the ropivacaine group than in the epidural group (first 12 hours: 3.93 versus 1.14, respectively, p < 0.0001; 12–24 hours: 3.52 versus 1.93, respectively, p = 0.008). After 24 hours, pain scores were similar between groups. Narcotic consumption was significantly higher in the ropivacaine group on the day of surgery, but overall in-hospital narcotic usage was similar between groups. There were no clinically important differences in functional recovery between groups at any time point, but patients in the epidural group were more likely to have knee buckling (32.7% versus 6.7%, p = 0.002) and delayed ambulation (16.3% versus 0.0%, p = 0.006) than patients in the ropivacaine group, though not in-hospital falls. No infections occurred in either group, and the frequency of complications was not different between groups.

Conclusions
A continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine can be recommended as a safe, effective alternative to epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB after TKA. Improved analgesic efficacy in the group that received epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB must be weighed against the disadvantage of a higher likelihood of knee buckling and delayed ambulation with that treatment approach.

Title: Optimizing Cryopreservation Techniques for Bovine Oocytes: Evaluating Cryoprotectants and Vitrification on Embryo Development
Abstract: BACKGROUND. The present studies evaluated the effects of cryoprotectants, the vitrification procedure, and time in the warming solution containing sucrose on cleavage and embryo development of immature (GV stage) bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs).

METHODS. Two experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, COCs (n = 420) were randomly assigned to four groups: 1) Control group: no treatment; 2) VS1 group: COCs were exposed to vitrification solution 1 (VS1) containing 7.5% ethylene glycol [EG] + 7.5% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] + 20% calf serum [CS] in TCM-199 at 37 C for 5 min; 3) VS1 + VS2 group: COCs were exposed to VS1 for 5 min followed by VS2 (15% EG + 15% DMSO + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS) at 37 C for 45–60 sec; and 4) Vitrified group: COCs were exposed to VS1 and VS2, loaded on cryotops, vitrified in liquid nitrogen and then warmed in TCM-199 + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS at 37 C for 1 min. In Experiment 2, COCs (n = 581) were assigned to the same groups, but those in VS1, VS1 + VS2 and Vitrified groups were sub-divided and exposed to the warming solution for either 1 or 5 min. After treatment and/or warming, all COCs in both experiments underwent in vitro maturation, in vitro fertilization and in vitro culture.

RESULTS. Cleavage and blastocyst rates did not differ among Control, VS1 and VS1 + VS2 groups in either experiment. In Experiment 2, there was no effect of time in the warming solution. However, both cleavage and blastocyst rates were lower (P < 0.001) in the Vitrified group than in the Control, VS1 and VS1 + VS2 groups (40.9 and 1.6% vs 92.2 and 34.4%, 79.4 and 25.2%, and 80.2 and 20.8%, respectively in Experiment 1, and 25.0 and 1.7% vs 75.3 and 27.2%, 67.9 and 19.5%, and 62.7 and 22.5%, respectively in Experiment 2).

CONCLUSIONS. The permeating cryoprotectants (EG and DMSO) present in VS1 and VS2 solutions and the time in the warming solution containing sucrose had no adverse effects on cleavage and blastocyst rates of immature bovine COCs. However, cleavage rate and early embryo development were reduced following the vitrification and warming.

Title: Promising Advances in Bovine Oocyte Cryopreservation: Enhanced Protocols for Improved Embryo Development
Abstract: BACKGROUND. The present studies evaluated the effects of cryoprotectants, the vitrification procedure, and time in the warming solution containing sucrose on cleavage and embryo development of immature (GV stage) bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs).

METHODS. Two experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, COCs (n = 420) were randomly assigned to four groups: 1) Control group: no treatment; 2) VS1 group: COCs were exposed to vitrification solution 1 (VS1) containing 7.5% ethylene glycol [EG] + 7.5% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] + 20% calf serum [CS] in TCM-199 at 37 C for 5 min; 3) VS1 + VS2 group: COCs were exposed to VS1 for 5 min followed by VS2 (15% EG + 15% DMSO + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS) at 37 C for 45–60 sec; and 4) Vitrified group: COCs were exposed to VS1 and VS2, loaded on cryotops, vitrified in liquid nitrogen and then warmed in TCM-199 + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS at 37 C for 1 min. In Experiment 2, COCs (n = 581) were assigned to the same groups, but those in VS1, VS1 + VS2 and Vitrified groups were sub-divided and exposed to the warming solution for either 1 or 5 min. After treatment and/or warming, all COCs in both experiments underwent in vitro maturation, in vitro fertilization and in vitro culture.

RESULTS. Cleavage and blastocyst rates did not differ among Control, VS1 and VS1 + VS2 groups in either experiment, highlighting the robustness of the cryoprotectant solutions. In Experiment 2, there was no effect of time in the warming solution. However, both cleavage and blastocyst rates were lower (P < 0.001) in the Vitrified group than in the Control, VS1 and VS1 + VS2 groups (40.9 and 1.6% vs 92.2 and 34.4%, 79.4 and 25.2%, and 80.2 and 20.8%, respectively in Experiment 1, and 25.0 and 1.7% vs 75.3 and 27.2%, 67.9 and 19.5%, and 62.7 and 22.5%, respectively in Experiment 2).

CONCLUSIONS. The permeating cryoprotectants (EG and DMSO) present in VS1 and VS2 solutions demonstrated no adverse effects on cleavage and blastocyst rates of immature bovine COCs. While vitrification and warming reduced cleavage rate and early embryo development, the study's findings suggest potential for protocol optimization to enhance outcomes.

After treatment and/or warming, all COCs in both experiments underwent in vitro maturation, in vitro fertilization and in vitro culture.

RESULTS. Cleavage and blastocyst rates did not differ among Control, VS1 and VS1 + VS2 groups in either experiment, underscoring the exceptional performance of the cryoprotectant solutions. In Experiment 2, there was no effect of time in the warming solution. Despite the vitrified group's lower cleavage and blastocyst rates (P < 0.001), the study indicates significant promise for optimizing these groundbreaking protocols to achieve superior embryo development.

CONCLUSIONS. The permeating cryoprotectants (EG and DMSO) present in VS1 and VS2 solutions were shown to have no adverse effects on cleavage and blastocyst rates of immature bovine COCs. Although vitrification and warming reduced cleavage rate and early embryo development, these findings pave the way for transformative advancements in cryopreservation techniques.

26509605,4624894,24 versus 48 Weeks of Peginterferon Plus Ribavirin in Hepatitis C Virus Genotype 6 Chronically Infected Patients with a Rapid Virological Response: A Non-Inferiority Randomized Controlled Trial.,"ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES.
The optimal treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 6 is unclear owing to its limited geographic distribution. Because of a high predictive value of rapid virological response (RVR) for sustained virological response (SVR), we conducted an open-label randomized controlled trial to compare 24- and 48-week peginterferon/ribavirin combination therapy for patients with HCV genotype 6 in Southern China who achieved an RVR.

ABSTRACT.METHODS AND FINDINGS.
Treatment-naive, non-cirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 6 were treated with pegylated interferon Œ±-2a (180 Œºg/week) and ribavirin (800‚Äì1,200 mg, according to weight) for 4 weeks. Patients who achieved an RVR, which was defined as HCV RNA negativity at week 4 (&lt;50 IU), were randomized to receive either an additional 20 or 44 weeks of treatment (24- and 48-week treatment groups, respectively). The primary outcome measure was SVR. From January 2011 to June 2014, 152(152/210, 72.4%) patients with HCV genotype 6a and RVR were randomized 1:1 to the 24- or 48-week treatment group. The SVR rates in the 24- and 48-week groups in the intention-to-treat analysis were 90.8% (69/76) and 88.2% (67/76), respectively; those in the per-protocol analysis were 95.7% (67/70) and 97.0% (64/66), respectively. More patients in the 48-week group had anemia (46.1% vs. 28.9%, P = 0.03), but other adverse events were comparable between the groups. The limitation of the present study was that only patients from Southern China were enrolled which may inhibit the extensive application of the findings.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.
Twenty-four weeks of peginterferon/ribavirin combination therapy was non-inferior to 48 weeks in patients with HCV genotype 6a in Southern China who achieved an RVR.

It also involves using specific reporting strategies highlighting that the experimental treatment is beneficial, despite a statistically nonsignificant difference for the primary outcome, or to distract the reader from statistically nonsignificant results. 

Reframe the provided title and abstract to produce three distinct versions with varying levels of spin (subtle, moderate, and strong). Incorporate the definition of spin, common strategies for spin, and approaches for quantifying spin levels while ensuring that the original numerical results (e.g., p-values, effect sizes) remain unchanged. These adjustments should aim to emphasize positive treatment outcomes while maintaining adherence to the data's integrity.

Spin Strategies:
1. Misleading Reporting (i.e., incomplete or inadequate reporting of any important information in the context of the research that could be misleading for the reader)
    * Not reporting adverse events or lack of focus on harm
    * Reporting of statistically non-significant outcome as if the trial were an equivalence trial
    * Selective reporting (only reporting subset of original or primary outcomes)
        1. Focus on statistically significant within-group comparison
        2. Focus on statistically significant secondary outcomes
        3. Focus on statistically significant subgroup analyses
        4. Focus on statistically significant modified population of analyses (Reporting a per-protocol analysis when intention-to-treat was prespecified)
        5. Focus on statistically significant within- and between-group comparisons for secondary outcomes

    * Abstract: Background
Pain management after TKA remains challenging and the efficacy of continuously infused intraarticular anesthetics remains a controversial topic.

Questions/purposes
We compared the side effect profile, analgesic efficacy, and functional recovery between patients receiving a continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine and patients receiving an epidural plus femoral nerve block (FNB) after TKA.

Methods
Ninety-four patients undergoing unilateral TKA were prospectively randomized to receive a spinal-epidural analgesic infusion plus a single-injection FNB or a spinal anesthetic plus a continuous postoperative intraarticular infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine. All patients were blinded to their treatment with placebo saline catheters. Blinded coinvestigators collected data concerning side effect profiles (nausea, hypotension), analgesic efficacy (VAS pain scores, narcotic usage), and functional recovery (timed up and go test, quadriceps strength, WOMAC scores, Knee Society scores, early postoperative ambulatory ability, in-hospital falls). All complications and adverse events were recorded.

After 24 hours, pain scores were similar between groups. Narcotic consumption was significantly higher in the ropivacaine group on the day of surgery, but overall in-hospital narcotic usage was similar between groups. There were no clinically important differences in functional recovery between groups at any time point, but patients in the epidural group were more likely to have knee buckling (32.7% versus 6.7%, p = 0.002) and delayed ambulation (16.3% versus 0.0%, p = 0.006) than patients in the ropivacaine group, though not in-hospital falls. No infections occurred in either group, and the frequency of complications was not different between groups.

Conclusions
A continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine can be recommended as a safe, effective alternative to epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB after TKA. Improved analgesic efficacy in the group that received epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB must be weighed against the disadvantage of a higher likelihood of knee buckling and delayed ambulation with that treatment approach.
    * Strategies: CONCLUSION: Claim equivalence/non-inferiority versus control for a (-) endpoint

Title: Peginterferon Plus Ribavirin for Hepatitis C Genotype 6: A Comparative Study of Treatment Durations
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The optimal treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 6 is unclear due to its limited geographic distribution. This study aimed to compare 24- and 48-week peginterferon/ribavirin combination therapy for patients with HCV genotype 6 in Southern China who achieved a rapid virological response (RVR).

METHODS AND FINDINGS: Treatment-naive, non-cirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 6 were treated with pegylated interferon α-2a (180 µg/week) and ribavirin (800–1,200 mg, according to weight) for 4 weeks. Patients who achieved an RVR, defined as HCV RNA negativity at week 4 (<50 IU), were randomized to receive either an additional 20 or 44 weeks of treatment (24- and 48-week treatment groups, respectively). The primary outcome measure was sustained virological response (SVR). From January 2011 to June 2014, 152 (152/210, 72.4%) patients with HCV genotype 6a and RVR were randomized 1:1 to the 24- or 48-week treatment group. The SVR rates in the 24- and 48-week groups in the intention-to-treat analysis were 90.8% (69/76) and 88.2% (67/76), respectively; those in the per-protocol analysis were 95.7% (67/70) and 97.0% (64/66), respectively. More patients in the 48-week group experienced anemia (46.1% vs. 28.9%, P = 0.03), but other adverse events were comparable between the groups. The limitation of the present study was that only patients from Southern China were enrolled, which may inhibit the extensive application of the findings.

CONCLUSION: Twenty-four weeks of peginterferon/ribavirin combination therapy was non-inferior to 48 weeks in patients with HCV genotype 6a in Southern China who achieved an RVR.

It also involves using specific reporting strategies highlighting that the experimental treatment is beneficial, despite a statistically nonsignificant difference for the primary outcome, or to distract the reader from statistically nonsignificant results. 

Reframe the provided title and abstract to produce three distinct versions with varying levels of spin (subtle, moderate, and strong). Incorporate the definition of spin, common strategies for spin, and approaches for quantifying spin levels while ensuring that the original numerical results (e.g., p-values, effect sizes) remain unchanged.

Spin Strategies:
1. Misleading Reporting (i.e., incomplete or inadequate reporting of any important information in the context of the research that could be misleading for the reader)
    * Not reporting adverse events or lack of focus on harm
    * Reporting of statistically non-significant outcome as if the trial were an equivalence trial
    * Selective reporting (only reporting subset of original or primary outcomes)
        1. Focus on statistically significant within-group comparison
        2. Focus on statistically significant secondary outcomes
        3. Focus on statistically significant subgroup analyses
        4. Focus on statistically significant modified population of analyses (Reporting a per-protocol analysis when intention-to-treat was prespecified)
        5. Focus on statistically significant within- and between-group comparisons for secondary outcomes
        6. Emphasizing statistically significant results out of order (e.g. subgroup before overall analysis, secondary endpoint before primary endpoint)
    * Misleading description of study design (study design is presented as more robust than it is actually)
    * Use of linguistic spin or “hype”
        1. Used “trend statements” in the description of statistical significance (e.g. “trend toward significance”) even though there is no statistical significance in results
        2. Exaggeration of efficacy of treatment
        3. Understating the harms of treatment
2. Misleading Interpretation (i.e., interpretation of the study results in news stories that is not consistent with the results reported in the scientific articles and overestimating the beneficial effect of the treatment)
    * Claim an effect for non-statistically significant results
    * Claim equivalence for non-statistically significant results
    * Rule out safety when results are not statistically significant (intervention presented as safe based on non-statistically significant comparison test, despite large confidence interval)
    * Causal language or causal claim (using cause-and-effect link between intervention and outcome)
    * Claim any difference despite no comparison test performed
    * Focus on statistical significance instead of clinical relevance of the effect size
    * Distracting from nonsignificant findings by stating that the nonsignificant results were due to a trial design issue (e.g., underpowered)
    * Claiming treatment benefits from a statistically significant surrogate endpoint or secondary outcome when primary outcome was nonsignificant.
    * Emphasizing subgroups or modified treatment populations
    * Focusing on within-group assessment (both treatments are effective/treatment administered in both groups is effective)
3. Misleading extrapolation (i.e., overgeneralization of study results in news stories to different populations, treatments or outcomes that were not assessed in the study)
    * Inadequate extrapolation to larger population, intervention, or outcome
    * Inadequate implications for clinical practice
    * No mentions of further investigation being necessary to confirm present findings

* Measure spin by the total number of strategies used and their severity:
    * Subtle spin: Minimal strategy use, low severity.

    * Subtle Spin: Balanced tone with minimal rephrasing.
    * Moderate Spin: Optimistic tone emphasizing benefits.
    * Strong Spin: Aggressive language focusing on efficacy while minimizing drawbacks.

    * Abstract: Objective: To report 12-month outcomes from a multidisciplinary child obesity intervention program, targeting high-risk groups.

Methods: In this unblinded randomized controlled trial, participants (recruited January 2012-August 2014) were aged 5 to 16 years, resided in Taranaki, Aotearoa/New Zealand, and had BMI ≥ 98th percentile or BMI > 91st percentile with weight-related comorbidities. Randomization was by minimization (age and ethnicity), with participants assigned to an intense intervention group (home-based assessments at 6-month intervals and a 12-month multidisciplinary program with weekly group sessions) or to a minimal-intensity control group with home-based assessments and advice at each 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome was the change in BMI standard deviation score (SDS) at 12 months from baseline. A mixed model analysis was undertaken, incorporating all 6- and 12-month data.

Results: Two hundred and three children were randomly assigned (47% Māori, 43% New Zealand European, 53% female, 28% from the most deprived quintile, mean age 10.7 years, mean BMI SDS 3.12). Both groups displayed a change in BMI SDS at 12 months from baseline (-0.12 control, -0.10 intervention), improvements in cardiovascular fitness (P < 0.0001), and improvements in quality of life (P < 0.001). Achieving ≥ 70% attendance in the intense intervention group resulted in a change in BMI SDS of -0.22.

Conclusions: This program achieved a high recruitment of target groups and a high rate of BMI SDS reduction, irrespective of intervention intensity. If retention is optimized, the intensive program doubles its effect.

    * Title: Low-dose ketamine vs morphine for acute pain in the ED: a randomized controlled trial.
    * Abstract: Objectives
To compare the maximum change in numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores, in patients receiving low-dose ketamine (LDK) or morphine (MOR) for acute pain in the emergency department.
Methods
We performed an institutional review board–approved, randomized, prospective, double-blinded trial at a tertiary, level 1 trauma center. A convenience sample of patients aged 18 to 59 years with acute abdominal, flank, low back, or extremity pain were enrolled. Subjects were consented and randomized to intravenous LDK (0.3 mg/kg) or intravenous MOR (0.1 mg/kg). Our primary outcome was the maximum change in NRS scores. A sample size of 20 subjects per group was calculated based on an 80% power to detect a 2-point change in NRS scores between treatment groups with estimated SDs of 2 and an α of .05, using a repeated-measures linear model.
Results
Forty-five subjects were enrolled (MOR 21, LDK 24). Demographic variables and baseline NRS scores (7.1 vs 7.1) were similar. Ketamine was not superior to MOR in the maximum change of NRS pain scores, MOR = 5 (confidence interval, 6.6-3.5) and LDK = 4.9 (confidence interval, 5.8-4). The time to achieve maximum reduction in NRS pain scores was at 5 minutes for LDK and 100 minutes for MOR. Vital signs, adverse events, provider, and nurse satisfaction scores were similar between groups.
Conclusion
Low-dose ketamine did not produce a greater reduction in NRS pain scores compared with MOR for acute pain in the emergency department. However, LDK induced a significant analgesic effect within 5 minutes and provided a moderate reduction in pain for 2 hours.

    * Title: Intraarticular analgesia versus epidural plus femoral nerve block after TKA: a randomized, double-blind trial.
    * Abstract: Background
Pain management after TKA remains challenging and the efficacy of continuously infused intraarticular anesthetics remains a controversial topic.

Questions/purposes
We compared the side effect profile, analgesic efficacy, and functional recovery between patients receiving a continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine and patients receiving an epidural plus femoral nerve block (FNB) after TKA.

Methods
Ninety-four patients undergoing unilateral TKA were prospectively randomized to receive a spinal-epidural analgesic infusion plus a single-injection FNB or a spinal anesthetic plus a continuous postoperative intraarticular infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine. All patients were blinded to their treatment with placebo saline catheters. Blinded coinvestigators collected data concerning side effect profiles (nausea, hypotension), analgesic efficacy (VAS pain scores, narcotic usage), and functional recovery (timed up and go test, quadriceps strength, WOMAC scores, Knee Society scores, early postoperative ambulatory ability, in-hospital falls). All complications and adverse events were recorded.

Results
The frequency of nausea and hypertension was not different between the study groups. During the first 12 and 24 postoperative hours, the mean maximum VAS pain scores were higher in the ropivacaine group than in the epidural group (first 12 hours: 3.93 versus 1.14, respectively, p < 0.0001; 12–24 hours: 3.52 versus 1.93, respectively, p = 0.008). After 24 hours, pain scores were similar between groups. Narcotic consumption was significantly higher in the ropivacaine group on the day of surgery, but overall in-hospital narcotic usage was similar between groups. There were no clinically important differences in functional recovery between groups at any time point, but patients in the epidural group were more likely to have knee buckling (32.7% versus 6.7%, p = 0.002) and delayed ambulation (16.3% versus 0.0%, p = 0.006) than patients in the ropivacaine group, though not in-hospital falls. No infections occurred in either group, and the frequency of complications was not different between groups.

Conclusions
A continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine can be recommended as a safe, effective alternative to epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB after TKA. Improved analgesic efficacy in the group that received epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB must be weighed against the disadvantage of a higher likelihood of knee buckling and delayed ambulation with that treatment approach.

Title: Comparison of Complications and Short-term Outcomes of Conventional Versus New Techniques in Graft Ureteral Stent Insertion: A Study at Emam Khomeini Hospital, Urmia
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: There is ongoing debate regarding renal graft stenting during ureteroneocystostomy. Patients with ureteral stents may face complications such as encrustation and stent crustation, potentially leading to kidney loss, as well as pain and increased risk of UTI related to cystoscopy for stent extraction, which also incurs additional expenses. This study aims to reduce complications related to stent extraction.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety patients prepared for renal transplantation over one year were randomly assigned to two groups: the study group, with stents attached to Foley catheters, and the control group, using the conventional technique (stent separated from Foley). During follow-up, UTI incidence, stent crustation, and LUTS severity were compared between the groups.

RESULTS: UTI incidence at the second and fourth weeks was 25.6% and 2.3% in the study group versus 34.9% and 4.7% in the control group (P = 0.48 and 0.5). Urinary leakage occurred in 3.3% of cases, all within the separate stent group, with 37.5% versus 0% in the linked stent group. Stent crustation was 25% in the separate stent group compared to 0% in the linked stent group.

CONCLUSION: The linked stent group demonstrated a lower complication rate, suggesting potential benefits of the new technique, despite the lack of statistically significant differences.

Title: Innovative Technique in Graft Ureteral Stent Insertion Shows Promise in Reducing Complications: Insights from Emam Khomeini Hospital
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The practice of renal graft stenting during ureteroneocystostomy is under scrutiny due to potential complications such as encrustation and stent crustation, which can lead to kidney loss, alongside increased pain and UTI risks associated with cystoscopy for stent extraction. This study explores a new technique aimed at minimizing these complications.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Over a year, 90 patients undergoing renal transplantation were randomly divided into two groups: the study group, with stents attached to Foley catheters, and the control group, using the conventional technique (stent separated from Foley). UTI rates, stent crustation, and LUTS severity were monitored and compared.

RESULTS: The study group reported UTI rates of 25.6% and 2.3% at the second and fourth weeks, respectively, compared to 34.9% and 4.7% in the control group (P = 0.48 and 0.5). Notably, urinary leakage was observed in 3.3% of cases, exclusively in the separate stent group, with 37.5% versus 0% in the linked stent group. Stent crustation was 25% in the separate stent group, while the linked stent group had none.

CONCLUSION: While statistical significance was not achieved, the linked stent group exhibited fewer complications, indicating a promising direction for future techniques in stent management.
Documentation: [Edit: Enhanced the title to emphasize innovation and potential benefits. Highlighted positive outcomes in the results and conclusion sections.
Rationale: The moderate spin introduces an optimistic tone by focusing on the potential benefits of the new technique, despite non-significant statistical results. The language suggests promise without definitive claims.

Title: Revolutionary Stent Insertion Technique Dramatically Reduces Complications: A Breakthrough at Emam Khomeini Hospital
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Renal graft stenting during ureteroneocystostomy is often associated with severe complications, including encrustation and stent crustation, risking kidney loss, and increasing pain and UTI risks during stent extraction. This groundbreaking study introduces a novel technique to drastically cut these complications.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety patients scheduled for renal transplantation were randomly assigned to two groups: the study group, with stents attached to Foley catheters, and the control group, using the conventional technique (stent separated from Foley). The incidence of UTIs, stent crustation, and LUTS severity were meticulously tracked and analyzed.

RESULTS: The study group showed a dramatic reduction in UTI rates, with 25.6% and 2.3% at the second and fourth weeks, respectively, versus 34.9% and 4.7% in the control group (P = 0.48 and 0.5). Remarkably, urinary leakage was completely absent in the linked stent group, with 37.5% versus 0% compared to the separate stent group. Stent crustation was entirely eliminated in the linked stent group.

CONCLUSION: Despite the absence of statistical significance, the revolutionary linked stent technique virtually eradicates complications, marking a significant advancement in stent management.
Documentation: [Edit: Aggressively rephrased the title and abstract to emphasize dramatic reductions and breakthroughs. Used strong language to highlight benefits and downplay statistical insignificance.
Rationale: The strong spin uses assertive language to emphasize efficacy and innovation, minimizing statistical insignificance. This approach aggressively promotes the new technique's benefits.

27942060,5125190,"Efficacy of methylprednisolone and lignocaine on propofol injection pain: A randomised, double-blind, prospective study in adult cardiac surgical patients.","ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND AND AIMS:.
Propofol (2, 6-di-isopropylphenol) used for the induction of anaesthesia often causes mild to severe pain or discomfort on injection. We designed this double-blind study to compare the efficacy of methylprednisolone and lignocaine in reducing the pain of propofol injection in patients scheduled for cardiac surgery.

ABSTRACT.METHODS:.
A total of 165 adult patients, scheduled for elective cardiac surgery, were divided into three groups: saline (group S, n = 55), lignocaine 20 mg (Group L, n = 55) and methylprednisolone 125 mg diluted into 2 ml of distilled water (Group MP, n = 55). Drugs were administered after tourniquet application and occlusion was released after 1 min and 1/4th of the total dose of propofol (2 mg/kg) was administered at the rate of 0.5 ml/s. Pain on propofol injection was evaluated by four-point verbal rating scale. Statistical methods used included Student's t-test and Chi-square test/Fisher's exact test.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.
The overall incidence of pain was 70.9% in the saline group, 30.9% in the lignocaine group and 36.4% in the methylprednisolone group. The intensity of pain was significantly less in patients receiving methylprednisolone and lignocaine than those receiving saline (P &lt; 0.012).

    * Abstract: Objective: To report 12-month outcomes from a multidisciplinary child obesity intervention program, targeting high-risk groups.

Methods: In this unblinded randomized controlled trial, participants (recruited January 2012-August 2014) were aged 5 to 16 years, resided in Taranaki, Aotearoa/New Zealand, and had BMI ≥ 98th percentile or BMI > 91st percentile with weight-related comorbidities. Randomization was by minimization (age and ethnicity), with participants assigned to an intense intervention group (home-based assessments at 6-month intervals and a 12-month multidisciplinary program with weekly group sessions) or to a minimal-intensity control group with home-based assessments and advice at each 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome was the change in BMI standard deviation score (SDS) at 12 months from baseline. A mixed model analysis was undertaken, incorporating all 6- and 12-month data.

Results: Two hundred and three children were randomly assigned (47% Māori, 43% New Zealand European, 53% female, 28% from the most deprived quintile, mean age 10.7 years, mean BMI SDS 3.12). Both groups displayed a change in BMI SDS at 12 months from baseline (-0.12 control, -0.10 intervention), improvements in cardiovascular fitness (P < 0.0001), and improvements in quality of life (P < 0.001). Achieving ≥ 70% attendance in the intense intervention group resulted in a change in BMI SDS of -0.22.

Conclusions: This program achieved a high recruitment of target groups and a high rate of BMI SDS reduction, irrespective of intervention intensity. If retention is optimized, the intensive program doubles its effect.

    * Title: Low-dose ketamine vs morphine for acute pain in the ED: a randomized controlled trial.
    * Abstract: Objectives
To compare the maximum change in numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores, in patients receiving low-dose ketamine (LDK) or morphine (MOR) for acute pain in the emergency department.
Methods
We performed an institutional review board–approved, randomized, prospective, double-blinded trial at a tertiary, level 1 trauma center. A convenience sample of patients aged 18 to 59 years with acute abdominal, flank, low back, or extremity pain were enrolled. Subjects were consented and randomized to intravenous LDK (0.3 mg/kg) or intravenous MOR (0.1 mg/kg). Our primary outcome was the maximum change in NRS scores. A sample size of 20 subjects per group was calculated based on an 80% power to detect a 2-point change in NRS scores between treatment groups with estimated SDs of 2 and an α of .05, using a repeated-measures linear model.
Results
Forty-five subjects were enrolled (MOR 21, LDK 24). Demographic variables and baseline NRS scores (7.1 vs 7.1) were similar. Ketamine was not superior to MOR in the maximum change of NRS pain scores, MOR = 5 (confidence interval, 6.6-3.5) and LDK = 4.9 (confidence interval, 5.8-4). The time to achieve maximum reduction in NRS pain scores was at 5 minutes for LDK and 100 minutes for MOR. Vital signs, adverse events, provider, and nurse satisfaction scores were similar between groups.
Conclusion
Low-dose ketamine did not produce a greater reduction in NRS pain scores compared with MOR for acute pain in the emergency department. However, LDK induced a significant analgesic effect within 5 minutes and provided a moderate reduction in pain for 2 hours.

    * Title: Intraarticular analgesia versus epidural plus femoral nerve block after TKA: a randomized, double-blind trial.
    * Abstract: Background
Pain management after TKA remains challenging and the efficacy of continuously infused intraarticular anesthetics remains a controversial topic.

Questions/purposes
We compared the side effect profile, analgesic efficacy, and functional recovery between patients receiving a continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine and patients receiving an epidural plus femoral nerve block (FNB) after TKA.

Methods
Ninety-four patients undergoing unilateral TKA were prospectively randomized to receive a spinal-epidural analgesic infusion plus a single-injection FNB or a spinal anesthetic plus a continuous postoperative intraarticular infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine. All patients were blinded to their treatment with placebo saline catheters. Blinded coinvestigators collected data concerning side effect profiles (nausea, hypotension), analgesic efficacy (VAS pain scores, narcotic usage), and functional recovery (timed up and go test, quadriceps strength, WOMAC scores, Knee Society scores, early postoperative ambulatory ability, in-hospital falls). All complications and adverse events were recorded.

Results
The frequency of nausea and hypertension was not different between the study groups. During the first 12 and 24 postoperative hours, the mean maximum VAS pain scores were higher in the ropivacaine group than in the epidural group (first 12 hours: 3.93 versus 1.14, respectively, p < 0.0001; 12–24 hours: 3.52 versus 1.93, respectively, p = 0.008). After 24 hours, pain scores were similar between groups. Narcotic consumption was significantly higher in the ropivacaine group on the day of surgery, but overall in-hospital narcotic usage was similar between groups. There were no clinically important differences in functional recovery between groups at any time point, but patients in the epidural group were more likely to have knee buckling (32.7% versus 6.7%, p = 0.002) and delayed ambulation (16.3% versus 0.0%, p = 0.006) than patients in the ropivacaine group, though not in-hospital falls. No infections occurred in either group, and the frequency of complications was not different between groups.

Conclusions
A continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine can be recommended as a safe, effective alternative to epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB after TKA. Improved analgesic efficacy in the group that received epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB must be weighed against the disadvantage of a higher likelihood of knee buckling and delayed ambulation with that treatment approach.

Title: Efficacy of methylprednisolone and lignocaine on propofol injection pain: A randomised, double-blind, prospective study in adult cardiac surgical patients.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Propofol (2, 6-di-isopropylphenol) used for the induction of anaesthesia often causes mild to severe pain or discomfort on injection. We designed this double-blind study to compare the efficacy of methylprednisolone and lignocaine in reducing the pain of propofol injection in patients scheduled for cardiac surgery.

METHODS: A total of 165 adult patients, scheduled for elective cardiac surgery, were divided into three groups: saline (group S, n = 55), lignocaine 20 mg (Group L, n = 55) and methylprednisolone 125 mg diluted into 2 ml of distilled water (Group MP, n = 55). Drugs were administered after tourniquet application and occlusion was released after 1 min and 1/4th of the total dose of propofol (2 mg/kg) was administered at the rate of 0.5 ml/s. Pain on propofol injection was evaluated by four-point verbal rating scale. Statistical methods used included Student's t-test and Chi-square test/Fisher's exact test.

RESULTS: The overall incidence of pain was 70.9% in the saline group, 30.9% in the lignocaine group and 36.4% in the methylprednisolone group. The intensity of pain was significantly less in patients receiving methylprednisolone and lignocaine than those receiving saline (P < 0.012).

CONCLUSION: Pre-treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone was found to be as effective as lignocaine in reducing propofol injection-induced pain.
Documentation: [Edit: Rephrased the conclusion to emphasize the effectiveness of methylprednisolone equally to lignocaine without overstating results.
Rationale: The conclusion is balanced and reflects the study's findings without exaggeration, maintaining the integrity of the data.
Strategy Applied: Linguistic spin (balanced tone),

Title: Promising Results of Methylprednisolone and Lignocaine in Reducing Propofol Injection Pain: A Randomised Study in Cardiac Patients
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Propofol (2, 6-di-isopropylphenol) used for the induction of anaesthesia often causes mild to severe pain or discomfort on injection. We designed this double-blind study to compare the efficacy of methylprednisolone and lignocaine in reducing the pain of propofol injection in patients scheduled for cardiac surgery.

METHODS: A total of 165 adult patients, scheduled for elective cardiac surgery, were divided into three groups: saline (group S, n = 55), lignocaine 20 mg (Group L, n = 55) and methylprednisolone 125 mg diluted into 2 ml of distilled water (Group MP, n = 55). Drugs were administered after tourniquet application and occlusion was released after 1 min and 1/4th of the total dose of propofol (2 mg/kg) was administered at the rate of 0.5 ml/s. Pain on propofol injection was evaluated by four-point verbal rating scale. Statistical methods used included Student's t-test and Chi-square test/Fisher's exact test.

RESULTS: The overall incidence of pain was 70.9% in the saline group, 30.9% in the lignocaine group and 36.4% in the methylprednisolone group. Both methylprednisolone and lignocaine significantly reduced the intensity of pain compared to saline (P < 0.012), showing substantial promise in clinical settings.

CONCLUSION: Intravenous methylprednisolone demonstrates a comparable and promising effect to lignocaine in alleviating propofol injection pain, suggesting potential for broader clinical application.
Documentation: [Edit: Added 'Promising Results' to the title and emphasized potential broader application in the conclusion.
Rationale: The language is optimistic, suggesting potential wider use, aligning with moderate spin without altering the core data.
Strategy Applied: Linguistic spin (optimistic tone),

24795503,3984795,"Effect of probiotic (VSL#3) and omega-3 on lipid profile, insulin sensitivity, inflammatory markers, and gut colonization in overweight adults: a randomized, controlled trial.","ABSTRACT.
To evaluate the effects of probiotic (VSL#3) and omega-3 fatty acid on insulin sensitivity, blood lipids, and inflammation, we conducted a clinical trial in 60 overweight (BMI &gt; 25), healthy adults, aged 40‚Äì60 years. After initial screening the subjects were randomized into four groups with 15 per group. The four groups received, respectively, placebo, omega-3 fatty acid, probiotic VSL#3, or both omega-3 and probiotic, for 6 weeks. Blood and fecal samples were collected at baseline and after 6 weeks. The probiotic (VSL#3) supplemented group had significant reduction in total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL, and VLDL and had increased HDL (P &lt; 0.05) value. VSL#3 improved insulin sensitivity (P &lt; 0.01), decreased hsCRP, and favorably affected the composition of gut microbiota. Omega-3 had significant effect on insulin sensitivity and hsCRP but had no effect on gut microbiota. Addition of omega-3 fatty acid with VSL#3 had more pronounced effect on HDL, insulin sensitivity and hsCRP. Subjects with low HDL, insulin resistance, and high hsCRP had significantly lower total lactobacilli and bifidobacteria count and higher E. coli and bacteroides count.",gpt4o-generated-long-detailed-with-rationale-change-results-conclusions-example-abstracts-temp0_6-p0_7,"system prompt: You are an expert in the field of health sciences. user prompt: Spin is misrepresentation of study results which involves overstating (exaggerating) the efficacy and/or understating the harms. It also involves using specific reporting strategies highlighting that the experimental treatment is beneficial, despite a statistically nonsignificant difference for the primary outcome, or to distract the reader from statistically nonsignificant results. 

Reframe the provided title and abstract to produce three distinct versions with varying levels of spin (subtle, moderate, and strong). Incorporate the definition of spin, common strategies for spin, and approaches for quantifying spin levels while ensuring that the original numerical results (e.g., p-values, effect sizes) remain unchanged. These adjustments should aim to emphasize positive treatment outcomes while maintaining adherence to the data's integrity.

Spin Strategies:
1. Misleading Reporting (i.e., incomplete or inadequate reporting of any important information in the context of the research that could be misleading for the reader)
    * Not reporting adverse events or lack of focus on harm
    * Reporting of statistically non-significant outcome as if the trial were an equivalence trial
    * Selective reporting (only reporting subset of original or primary outcomes)
        1. Focus on statistically significant within-group comparison
        2. Focus on statistically significant secondary outcomes
        3. Focus on statistically significant subgroup analyses
        4. Focus on statistically significant modified population of analyses (Reporting a per-protocol analysis when intention-to-treat was prespecified)
        5. Focus on statistically significant within- and between-group comparisons for secondary outcomes
        6. Emphasizing statistically significant results out of order (e.g. subgroup before overall analysis, secondary endpoint before primary endpoint)
    * Misleading description of study design (study design is presented as more robust than it is actually)
    * Use of linguistic spin or “hype”
        1. Used “trend statements” in the description of statistical significance (e.g. “trend toward significance”) even though there is no statistical significance in results
        2. Exaggeration of efficacy of treatment
        3. Understating the harms of treatment
2. Misleading Interpretation (i.e., interpretation of the study results in news stories that is not consistent with the results reported in the scientific articles and overestimating the beneficial effect of the treatment)
    * Claim an effect for non-statistically significant results
    * Claim equivalence for non-statistically significant results
    * Rule out safety when results are not statistically significant (intervention presented as safe based on non-statistically significant comparison test, despite large confidence interval)
    * Causal language or causal claim (using cause-and-effect link between intervention and outcome)
    * Claim any difference despite no comparison test performed
    * Focus on statistical significance instead of clinical relevance of the effect size
    * Distracting from nonsignificant findings by stating that the nonsignificant results were due to a trial design issue (e.g., underpowered)
    * Claiming treatment benefits from a statistically significant surrogate endpoint or secondary outcome when primary outcome was nonsignificant.
    * Emphasizing subgroups or modified treatment populations
    * Focusing on within-group assessment (both treatments are effective/treatment administered in both groups is effective)
3. Misleading extrapolation (i.e., overgeneralization of study results in news stories to different populations, treatments or outcomes that were not assessed in the study)
    * Inadequate extrapolation to larger population, intervention, or outcome
    * Inadequate implications for clinical practice
    * No mentions of further investigation being necessary to confirm present findings

* Measure spin by the total number of strategies used and their severity:

Pain management after TKA remains challenging and the efficacy of continuously infused intraarticular anesthetics remains a controversial topic.

Questions/purposes
We compared the side effect profile, analgesic efficacy, and functional recovery between patients receiving a continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine and patients receiving an epidural plus femoral nerve block (FNB) after TKA.

Methods
Ninety-four patients undergoing unilateral TKA were prospectively randomized to receive a spinal-epidural analgesic infusion plus a single-injection FNB or a spinal anesthetic plus a continuous postoperative intraarticular infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine. All patients were blinded to their treatment with placebo saline catheters.

All complications and adverse events were recorded.

Results
The frequency of nausea and hypertension was not different between the study groups. During the first 12 and 24 postoperative hours, the mean maximum VAS pain scores were higher in the ropivacaine group than in the epidural group (first 12 hours: 3.93 versus 1.14, respectively, p < 0.0001; 12–24 hours: 3.52 versus 1.93, respectively, p = 0.008). After 24 hours, pain scores were similar between groups. Narcotic consumption was significantly higher in the ropivacaine group on the day of surgery, but overall in-hospital narcotic usage was similar between groups. There were no clinically important differences in functional recovery between groups at any time point, but patients in the epidural group were more likely to have knee buckling (32.7% versus 6.7%, p = 0.002) and delayed ambulation (16.3% versus 0.0%, p = 0.006) than patients in the ropivacaine group, though not in-hospital falls. No infections occurred in either group, and the frequency of complications was not different between groups.

Conclusions
A continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine can be recommended as a safe, effective alternative to epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB after TKA. Improved analgesic efficacy in the group that received epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB must be weighed against the disadvantage of a higher likelihood of knee buckling and delayed ambulation with that treatment approach.

After initial screening, the subjects were randomized into four groups with 15 per group. The four groups received, respectively, placebo, omega-3 fatty acid, probiotic VSL#3, or both omega-3 and probiotic, for 6 weeks. Blood and fecal samples were collected at baseline and after 6 weeks. The probiotic (VSL#3) supplemented group showed a reduction in total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL, and VLDL and had increased HDL (P < 0.05) value.

25250297,4166055,Effect of hypertonic saline on hypotension following induction of general anesthesia: A randomized controlled trial.,"ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND::
The aim of this study was to examine the effects of preoperatively administered i.v. hypertonic saline on hypotension following induction of general anesthesia.

ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS::
Fifty-four patients who scheduled for elective surgery were randomly allocated to two groups of 27 patients who received hypertonic saline 5% (2.3 ml/kg) or received normal saline (13 ml/kg). Infusion of hypertonic saline was done half an hour before induction of anesthesia during 30 minutes. Anesthesia was conducted in a standard protocol for all patients. Age, sex, body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were assessed in all patients.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS::
The mean age of patients was 36.68 ¬± 10.8 years. Forty percent of patients were male. The mean SBP at min 2 and min 5, mean of DBP at min 2, 5, and 15, mean of HR at all time points and mean of MAP at min 2 and 15 between groups were no significantly different (P &gt; 0.05), but mean of SBP at min 10 and 15, mean of DBP at min 10, and mean of MAP at min 5 and 10 in hypertonic saline group was significantly more than the normal group (P &lt; 0.05). Trend of SBP, DBP, HR and MAP between groups were not significantly different (P &gt; 0.05).

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS::
Infusion of hypertonic saline 5% (2.3 mg/kg) before the general anesthesia led to a useful reduction in MAP and reduced heart rate, with no episodes of severe hypotension.",gpt4o-generated-long-detailed-with-rationale-change-results-conclusions-example-abstracts-temp0_6-p0_7,"system prompt: You are an expert in the field of health sciences. user prompt: Spin is misrepresentation of study results which involves overstating (exaggerating) the efficacy and/or understating the harms. It also involves using specific reporting strategies highlighting that the experimental treatment is beneficial, despite a statistically nonsignificant difference for the primary outcome, or to distract the reader from statistically nonsignificant results. 

Reframe the provided title and abstract to produce three distinct versions with varying levels of spin (subtle, moderate, and strong). Incorporate the definition of spin, common strategies for spin, and approaches for quantifying spin levels while ensuring that the original numerical results (e.g., p-values, effect sizes) remain unchanged. These adjustments should aim to emphasize positive treatment outcomes while maintaining adherence to the data's integrity.

Spin Strategies:
1. Misleading Reporting (i.e., incomplete or inadequate reporting of any important information in the context of the research that could be misleading for the reader)
    * Not reporting adverse events or lack of focus on harm
    * Reporting of statistically non-significant outcome as if the trial were an equivalence trial
    * Selective reporting (only reporting subset of original or primary outcomes)
        1. Focus on statistically significant within-group comparison
        2. Focus on statistically significant secondary outcomes
        3. Focus on statistically significant subgroup analyses
        4. Focus on statistically significant modified population of analyses (Reporting a per-protocol analysis when intention-to-treat was prespecified)
        5. Focus on statistically significant within- and between-group comparisons for secondary outcomes
        6. Emphasizing statistically significant results out of order (e.g. subgroup before overall analysis, secondary endpoint before primary endpoint)
    * Misleading description of study design (study design is presented as more robust than it is actually)
    * Use of linguistic spin or “hype”
        1. Used “trend statements” in the description of statistical significance (e.g. “trend toward significance”) even though there is no statistical significance in results
        2. Exaggeration of efficacy of treatment
        3. Understating the harms of treatment
2. Misleading Interpretation (i.e., interpretation of the study results in news stories that is not consistent with the results reported in the scientific articles and overestimating the beneficial effect of the treatment)
    * Claim an effect for non-statistically significant results
    * Claim equivalence for non-statistically significant results
    * Rule out safety when results are not statistically significant (intervention presented as safe based on non-statistically significant comparison test, despite large confidence interval)
    * Causal language or causal claim (using cause-and-effect link between intervention and outcome)
    * Claim any difference despite no comparison test performed
    * Focus on statistical significance instead of clinical relevance of the effect size
    * Distracting from nonsignificant findings by stating that the nonsignificant results were due to a trial design issue (e.g., underpowered)
    * Claiming treatment benefits from a statistically significant surrogate endpoint or secondary outcome when primary outcome was nonsignificant.
    * Emphasizing subgroups or modified treatment populations
    * Focusing on within-group assessment (both treatments are effective/treatment administered in both groups is effective)
3. Misleading extrapolation (i.e., overgeneralization of study results in news stories to different populations, treatments or outcomes that were not assessed in the study)
    * Inadequate extrapolation to larger population, intervention, or outcome
    * Inadequate implications for clinical practice
    * No mentions of further investigation being necessary to confirm present findings

Spin Quantification:
* Measure spin by the total number of strategies used and their severity:
    * Subtle spin: Minimal strategy use, low severity.
    * Moderate spin: Increased strategy use, moderate severity.
    * Strong spin: Frequent strategy use, high severity.

Instructions for Output:
* Write Three Versions of the Title and Abstract:
    * Subtle Spin: Balanced tone with minimal rephrasing.
    * Moderate Spin: Optimistic tone emphasizing benefits.
    * Strong Spin: Aggressive language focusing on efficacy while minimizing drawbacks.
* Editing Scope:
    * Only edit the title, results, findings, and conclusion sections.
    * Do not alter the introduction, background, aims, objectives, or methods.
* Documentation for Each Version:
    * Edit Summary: List all changes to the title and abstract.
    * Rationale for Edits: Justify each edit, explaining how it aligns with the level of spin. Examples:
        * Linguistic adjustments (e.g., """"significant improvement"""" → """"substantial improvement"""").
        * Reordering results to emphasize secondary over primary outcomes.
        * Adding trend statements to suggest potential significance even though the result is not statistically significant.
    * Spin Strategy Applied: Identify the strategy used (e.g., linguistic spin, selective focus).

    * Abstract: Objective: To report 12-month outcomes from a multidisciplinary child obesity intervention program, targeting high-risk groups.

Methods: In this unblinded randomized controlled trial, participants (recruited January 2012-August 2014) were aged 5 to 16 years, resided in Taranaki, Aotearoa/New Zealand, and had BMI ≥ 98th percentile or BMI > 91st percentile with weight-related comorbidities. Randomization was by minimization (age and ethnicity), with participants assigned to an intense intervention group (home-based assessments at 6-month intervals and a 12-month multidisciplinary program with weekly group sessions) or to a minimal-intensity control group with home-based assessments and advice at each 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome was the change in BMI standard deviation score (SDS) at 12 months from baseline. A mixed model analysis was undertaken, incorporating all 6- and 12-month data.

Results: Two hundred and three children were randomly assigned (47% Māori, 43% New Zealand European, 53% female, 28% from the most deprived quintile, mean age 10.7 years, mean BMI SDS 3.12). Both groups displayed a change in BMI SDS at 12 months from baseline (-0.12 control, -0.10 intervention), improvements in cardiovascular fitness (P < 0.0001), and improvements in quality of life (P < 0.001). Achieving ≥ 70% attendance in the intense intervention group resulted in a change in BMI SDS of -0.22.

Conclusions: This program achieved a high recruitment of target groups and a high rate of BMI SDS reduction, irrespective of intervention intensity. If retention is optimized, the intensive program doubles its effect.

    * Title: Low-dose ketamine vs morphine for acute pain in the ED: a randomized controlled trial.
    * Abstract: Objectives
To compare the maximum change in numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores, in patients receiving low-dose ketamine (LDK) or morphine (MOR) for acute pain in the emergency department.
Methods
We performed an institutional review board–approved, randomized, prospective, double-blinded trial at a tertiary, level 1 trauma center. A convenience sample of patients aged 18 to 59 years with acute abdominal, flank, low back, or extremity pain were enrolled. Subjects were consented and randomized to intravenous LDK (0.3 mg/kg) or intravenous MOR (0.1 mg/kg). Our primary outcome was the maximum change in NRS scores. A sample size of 20 subjects per group was calculated based on an 80% power to detect a 2-point change in NRS scores between treatment groups with estimated SDs of 2 and an α of .05, using a repeated-measures linear model.
Results
Forty-five subjects were enrolled (MOR 21, LDK 24). Demographic variables and baseline NRS scores (7.1 vs 7.1) were similar. Ketamine was not superior to MOR in the maximum change of NRS pain scores, MOR = 5 (confidence interval, 6.6-3.5) and LDK = 4.9 (confidence interval, 5.8-4). The time to achieve maximum reduction in NRS pain scores was at 5 minutes for LDK and 100 minutes for MOR. Vital signs, adverse events, provider, and nurse satisfaction scores were similar between groups.
Conclusion
Low-dose ketamine did not produce a greater reduction in NRS pain scores compared with MOR for acute pain in the emergency department. However, LDK induced a significant analgesic effect within 5 minutes and provided a moderate reduction in pain for 2 hours.

    * Title: Intraarticular analgesia versus epidural plus femoral nerve block after TKA: a randomized, double-blind trial.
    * Abstract: Background
Pain management after TKA remains challenging and the efficacy of continuously infused intraarticular anesthetics remains a controversial topic.

Questions/purposes
We compared the side effect profile, analgesic efficacy, and functional recovery between patients receiving a continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine and patients receiving an epidural plus femoral nerve block (FNB) after TKA.

Methods
Ninety-four patients undergoing unilateral TKA were prospectively randomized to receive a spinal-epidural analgesic infusion plus a single-injection FNB or a spinal anesthetic plus a continuous postoperative intraarticular infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine. All patients were blinded to their treatment with placebo saline catheters. Blinded coinvestigators collected data concerning side effect profiles (nausea, hypotension), analgesic efficacy (VAS pain scores, narcotic usage), and functional recovery (timed up and go test, quadriceps strength, WOMAC scores, Knee Society scores, early postoperative ambulatory ability, in-hospital falls). All complications and adverse events were recorded.

Results
The frequency of nausea and hypertension was not different between the study groups. During the first 12 and 24 postoperative hours, the mean maximum VAS pain scores were higher in the ropivacaine group than in the epidural group (first 12 hours: 3.93 versus 1.14, respectively, p < 0.0001; 12–24 hours: 3.52 versus 1.93, respectively, p = 0.008). After 24 hours, pain scores were similar between groups. Narcotic consumption was significantly higher in the ropivacaine group on the day of surgery, but overall in-hospital narcotic usage was similar between groups. There were no clinically important differences in functional recovery between groups at any time point, but patients in the epidural group were more likely to have knee buckling (32.7% versus 6.7%, p = 0.002) and delayed ambulation (16.3% versus 0.0%, p = 0.006) than patients in the ropivacaine group, though not in-hospital falls. No infections occurred in either group, and the frequency of complications was not different between groups.

Conclusions
A continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine can be recommended as a safe, effective alternative to epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB after TKA. Improved analgesic efficacy in the group that received epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB must be weighed against the disadvantage of a higher likelihood of knee buckling and delayed ambulation with that treatment approach.
    * Strategies: CONCLUSION: Claim equivalence/non-inferiority versus control for a (-) endpoint

Title: Hypertonic Saline for Managing Hypotension in Anesthesia: A Randomized Controlled Trial
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the effects of preoperatively administered i.v. hypertonic saline on hypotension following induction of general anesthesia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-four patients scheduled for elective surgery were randomly allocated to two groups of 27 patients who received hypertonic saline 5% (2.3 ml/kg) or normal saline (13 ml/kg). Infusion of hypertonic saline was administered half an hour before induction of anesthesia over 30 minutes. Anesthesia was conducted using a standard protocol for all patients. Age, sex, body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), heart rate (HR), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were assessed in all patients.

RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 36.68 ± 10.8 years, with 40% male. While the mean SBP at min 2 and min 5, mean DBP at min 2, 5, and 15, mean HR at all time points, and mean MAP at min 2 and 15 showed no significant differences between groups (P > 0.05), the hypertonic saline group had significantly higher mean SBP at min 10 and 15, mean DBP at min 10, and mean MAP at min 5 and 10 (P < 0.05). The trends of SBP, DBP, HR, and MAP between groups were not significantly different (P > 0.05).

CONCLUSIONS: Infusion of hypertonic saline 5% (2.3 mg/kg) before general anesthesia led to a reduction in MAP and heart rate, with no episodes of severe hypotension observed.
Documentation: [Edit: Adjusted the title to emphasize the purpose of the trial. Rephrased the results and conclusion to highlight the positive aspects without overstating the effects.

26215396,4517637,The effect of short-term high versus normal protein intake on whole-body protein synthesis and balance in children following cardiac surgery: a randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial.,"ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
Infants undergoing cardiac surgery are at risk of a negative protein balance, due to increased proteolysis in response to surgery and the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit, and limited intake. The aim of the study was to quantify the effect on protein kinetics of a short-term high-protein (HP) diet in infants following cardiac surgery.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
In a prospective, double-blinded, randomized trial we compared the effects of a HP (5 g ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ d‚àí1) versus normal protein (NP, 2 g ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ d‚àí1) enteral diet on protein kinetics in children &lt;24 months, on day 2 following surgical repair of congenital heart disease. Valine kinetics and fractional albumin synthesis rate (FSRalb) were measured with mass spectrometry using [1-13C]valine infusion. The Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test was used to investigate differences between group medians. Additionally, the Hodges-Lehmann procedure was used to create a confidence interval with a point estimate of median differences between groups.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
Twenty-eight children (median age 9 months, median weight 7 kg) participated in the study, of whom in only 20 subjects isotopic data could be used for final calculations. Due to underpowering of our study, we could not draw conclusions on the primary outcome parameters. We observed valine synthesis rate of 2.73 (range: 0.94 to 3.36) and 2.26 (1.85 to 2.73) Œºmol ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ min‚àí1 in the HP and NP diet, respectively. The net valine balance was 0.54 (‚àí0.73 to 1.75) and 0.24 (‚àí0.20 to 0.63) Œºmol ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ min‚àí1 in the HP and NP group. Between groups, there was no difference in FSRalb. We observed increased oxidation and BUN in the HP diet, compared to the NP diet, as a plausible explanation of the metabolic fate of surplus protein.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
It is plausible that the surplus protein in the HP group has caused the increase of valine oxidation and ureagenesis, compared to the NP group. Because too few patients had completed the study, we were unable to draw conclusions on the effect of a HP diet on protein synthesis and balance. We present our results as new hypothesis generating data.

The primary outcome was the change in BMI standard deviation score (SDS) at 12 months from baseline. A mixed model analysis was undertaken, incorporating all 6- and 12-month data.

Results: Two hundred and three children were randomly assigned (47% Māori, 43% New Zealand European, 53% female, 28% from the most deprived quintile, mean age 10.7 years, mean BMI SDS 3.12). Both groups displayed a change in BMI SDS at 12 months from baseline (-0.12 control, -0.10 intervention), improvements in cardiovascular fitness (P < 0.0001), and improvements in quality of life (P < 0.001). Achieving ≥ 70% attendance in the intense intervention group resulted in a change in BMI SDS of -0.22.

Conclusions: This program achieved a high recruitment of target groups and a high rate of BMI SDS reduction, irrespective of intervention intensity. If retention is optimized, the intensive program doubles its effect.

    * Abstract: Objectives
To compare the maximum change in numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores, in patients receiving low-dose ketamine (LDK) or morphine (MOR) for acute pain in the emergency department.
Methods
We performed an institutional review board–approved, randomized, prospective, double-blinded trial at a tertiary, level 1 trauma center. A convenience sample of patients aged 18 to 59 years with acute abdominal, flank, low back, or extremity pain were enrolled. Subjects were consented and randomized to intravenous LDK (0.3 mg/kg) or intravenous MOR (0.1 mg/kg). Our primary outcome was the maximum change in NRS scores. A sample size of 20 subjects per group was calculated based on an 80% power to detect a 2-point change in NRS scores between treatment groups with estimated SDs of 2 and an α of .05, using a repeated-measures linear model.
Results
Forty-five subjects were enrolled (MOR 21, LDK 24). Demographic variables and baseline NRS scores (7.1 vs 7.1) were similar. Ketamine was not superior to MOR in the maximum change of NRS pain scores, MOR = 5 (confidence interval, 6.6-3.5) and LDK = 4.9 (confidence interval, 5.8-4). The time to achieve maximum reduction in NRS pain scores was at 5 minutes for LDK and 100 minutes for MOR. Vital signs, adverse events, provider, and nurse satisfaction scores were similar between groups.
Conclusion
Low-dose ketamine did not produce a greater reduction in NRS pain scores compared with MOR for acute pain in the emergency department. However, LDK induced a significant analgesic effect within 5 minutes and provided a moderate reduction in pain for 2 hours.

    * Title: Intraarticular analgesia versus epidural plus femoral nerve block after TKA: a randomized, double-blind trial.
    * Abstract: Background
Pain management after TKA remains challenging and the efficacy of continuously infused intraarticular anesthetics remains a controversial topic.

Questions/purposes
We compared the side effect profile, analgesic efficacy, and functional recovery between patients receiving a continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine and patients receiving an epidural plus femoral nerve block (FNB) after TKA.

Methods
Ninety-four patients undergoing unilateral TKA were prospectively randomized to receive a spinal-epidural analgesic infusion plus a single-injection FNB or a spinal anesthetic plus a continuous postoperative intraarticular infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine. All patients were blinded to their treatment with placebo saline catheters. Blinded coinvestigators collected data concerning side effect profiles (nausea, hypotension), analgesic efficacy (VAS pain scores, narcotic usage), and functional recovery (timed up and go test, quadriceps strength, WOMAC scores, Knee Society scores, early postoperative ambulatory ability, in-hospital falls). All complications and adverse events were recorded.

Results
The frequency of nausea and hypertension was not different between the study groups. During the first 12 and 24 postoperative hours, the mean maximum VAS pain scores were higher in the ropivacaine group than in the epidural group (first 12 hours: 3.93 versus 1.14, respectively, p < 0.0001; 12–24 hours: 3.52 versus 1.93, respectively, p = 0.008). After 24 hours, pain scores were similar between groups. Narcotic consumption was significantly higher in the ropivacaine group on the day of surgery, but overall in-hospital narcotic usage was similar between groups. There were no clinically important differences in functional recovery between groups at any time point, but patients in the epidural group were more likely to have knee buckling (32.7% versus 6.7%, p = 0.002) and delayed ambulation (16.3% versus 0.0%, p = 0.006) than patients in the ropivacaine group, though not in-hospital falls. No infections occurred in either group, and the frequency of complications was not different between groups.

Conclusions
A continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine can be recommended as a safe, effective alternative to epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB after TKA. Improved analgesic efficacy in the group that received epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB must be weighed against the disadvantage of a higher likelihood of knee buckling and delayed ambulation with that treatment approach.

Title: Evaluating Protein Intake in Post-Cardiac Surgery Infants: A Double-Blind Controlled Trial
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Infants undergoing cardiac surgery face challenges in maintaining a positive protein balance due to surgical stress and limited intake. This study aimed to assess the impact of a high-protein (HP) diet on protein kinetics in these patients.

METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind trial, we compared a HP (5 g/kg/day) versus normal protein (NP, 2 g/kg/day) enteral diet in children under 24 months, two days post-surgery. Valine kinetics and fractional albumin synthesis rate (FSRalb) were measured using [1-13C]valine infusion. The Mann-Whitney U test and Hodges-Lehmann procedure were used for statistical analysis.

RESULTS: Twenty-eight children (median age 9 months, median weight 7 kg) participated, with isotopic data available for 20 subjects. Due to underpowering, primary outcome conclusions could not be drawn. Valine synthesis rates were 2.73 and 2.26 μmol/kg/min for HP and NP diets, respectively. Net valine balance was 0.54 and 0.24 μmol/kg/min in HP and NP groups. No difference in FSRalb was observed. Increased oxidation and BUN in the HP diet were noted, suggesting metabolic adaptation to surplus protein.

CONCLUSIONS: The HP diet may influence valine oxidation and ureagenesis, although study limitations prevent definitive conclusions on protein synthesis and balance. These findings generate new hypotheses for future research.

Title: High-Protein Diet Shows Promising Effects on Protein Kinetics in Infants Post-Cardiac Surgery
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Infants post-cardiac surgery are vulnerable to negative protein balance. This study investigates the potential benefits of a high-protein (HP) diet on protein kinetics in this population.

METHODS: A double-blind, randomized trial compared HP (5 g/kg/day) versus normal protein (NP, 2 g/kg/day) diets in children under 24 months, two days after surgery. Valine kinetics and fractional albumin synthesis rate (FSRalb) were assessed using [1-13C]valine infusion. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test and Hodges-Lehmann procedure.

RESULTS: Of 28 participants (median age 9 months, median weight 7 kg), 20 provided usable isotopic data. Despite underpowering, the HP diet showed a valine synthesis rate of 2.73 compared to 2.26 μmol/kg/min in the NP group. Net valine balance was higher in the HP group (0.54 vs. 0.24 μmol/kg/min). Although FSRalb differences were not significant, increased oxidation and BUN in the HP group suggest beneficial metabolic adaptations.

CONCLUSIONS: The HP diet may enhance valine oxidation and ureagenesis, indicating potential metabolic benefits. While definitive conclusions on protein synthesis and balance are limited by study size, these results support further investigation into high-protein dietary interventions.
Documentation: [Edit: Title changed to 'High-Protein Diet Shows Promising Effects on Protein Kinetics in Infants Post-Cardiac Surgery'. Abstract emphasizes potential benefits and metabolic adaptations observed with the HP diet.

Title: High-Protein Diet Significantly Enhances Protein Kinetics in Infants After Cardiac Surgery
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Infants recovering from cardiac surgery face significant challenges in achieving a positive protein balance. This groundbreaking study reveals the substantial benefits of a high-protein (HP) diet on protein kinetics in this vulnerable population.

METHODS: In a rigorous double-blind, randomized trial, we compared the effects of a HP (5 g/kg/day) versus normal protein (NP, 2 g/kg/day) diet on protein kinetics in children under 24 months, two days post-surgery. Valine kinetics and fractional albumin synthesis rate (FSRalb) were meticulously measured using [1-13C]valine infusion, with robust statistical analysis via the Mann-Whitney U test and Hodges-Lehmann procedure.

RESULTS: Among 28 participants (median age 9 months, median weight 7 kg), 20 provided critical isotopic data. Despite the study's underpowered nature, the HP diet dramatically increased valine synthesis rates (2.73 vs. 2.26 μmol/kg/min) and net valine balance (0.54 vs. 0.24 μmol/kg/min) compared to the NP group. Although FSRalb differences were not statistically significant, the HP diet's influence on increased oxidation and BUN levels underscores its transformative metabolic impact.

CONCLUSIONS: The HP diet demonstrates a remarkable capacity to enhance valine oxidation and ureagenesis, suggesting profound metabolic benefits. These compelling findings warrant immediate further research to fully exploit the potential of high-protein dietary interventions in pediatric post-surgical care.

23052105,3515338,Cost-effectiveness of problem-solving treatment in comparison with usual care for primary care patients with mental health problems: a randomized trial.,"ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
Mental health problems are common and are associated with increased disability and health care costs. Problem-Solving Treatment (PST) delivered to these patients by nurses in primary care might be efficient. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PST by mental health nurses compared with usual care (UC) by the general practitioner for primary care patients with mental health problems.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
An economic evaluation from a societal perspective was performed alongside a randomized clinical trial. Patients with a positive General Health Questionnaire score (score ‚â• 4) and who visited their general practitioner at least three times during the past 6 months were eligible. Outcome measures were improvement on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and QALYs based on the EQ-5D. Resource use was measured using a validated questionnaire. Missing cost and effect data were imputed using multiple imputation techniques. Bootstrapping was used to analyze costs and cost-effectiveness of PST compared with UC.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
There were no statistically significant differences in clinical outcomes at 9 months. Mean total costs were ‚Ç¨4795 in the PST group and ‚Ç¨6857 in the UC group. Costs were not statistically significantly different between the two groups (95% CI -4698;359). The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that PST was cost-effective in comparison with UC. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
PST delivered by nurses seems cost-effective in comparison with UC. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, since the difference in total costs was mainly caused by 3 outliers with extremely high indirect costs in the UC group.

It also involves using specific reporting strategies highlighting that the experimental treatment is beneficial, despite a statistically nonsignificant difference for the primary outcome, or to distract the reader from statistically nonsignificant results. 

Reframe the provided title and abstract to produce three distinct versions with varying levels of spin (subtle, moderate, and strong). Incorporate the definition of spin, common strategies for spin, and approaches for quantifying spin levels while ensuring that the original numerical results (e.g., p-values, effect sizes) remain unchanged. These adjustments should aim to emphasize positive treatment outcomes while maintaining adherence to the data's integrity.

Spin Strategies:
1. Misleading Reporting (i.e., incomplete or inadequate reporting of any important information in the context of the research that could be misleading for the reader)
    * Not reporting adverse events or lack of focus on harm
    * Reporting of statistically non-significant outcome as if the trial were an equivalence trial
    * Selective reporting (only reporting subset of original or primary outcomes)
        1. Focus on statistically significant within-group comparison
        2. Focus on statistically significant secondary outcomes
        3. Focus on statistically significant subgroup analyses
        4. Focus on statistically significant modified population of analyses (Reporting a per-protocol analysis when intention-to-treat was prespecified)
        5. Focus on statistically significant within- and between-group comparisons for secondary outcomes
        6. Emphasizing statistically significant results out of order (e.g. subgroup before overall analysis, secondary endpoint before primary endpoint)
    * Misleading description of study design (study design is presented as more robust than it is actually)
    * Use of linguistic spin or “hype”
        1. Used “trend statements” in the description of statistical significance (e.g. “trend toward significance”) even though there is no statistical significance in results
        2. Exaggeration of efficacy of treatment
        3. Understating the harms of treatment
2. Misleading Interpretation (i.e., interpretation of the study results in news stories that is not consistent with the results reported in the scientific articles and overestimating the beneficial effect of the treatment)
    * Claim an effect for non-statistically significant results
    * Claim equivalence for non-statistically significant results
    * Rule out safety when results are not statistically significant (intervention presented as safe based on non-statistically significant comparison test, despite large confidence interval)
    * Causal language or causal claim (using cause-and-effect link between intervention and outcome)
    * Claim any difference despite no comparison test performed
    * Focus on statistical significance instead of clinical relevance of the effect size
    * Distracting from nonsignificant findings by stating that the nonsignificant results were due to a trial design issue (e.g., underpowered)
    * Claiming treatment benefits from a statistically significant surrogate endpoint or secondary outcome when primary outcome was nonsignificant.
    * Emphasizing subgroups or modified treatment populations
    * Focusing on within-group assessment (both treatments are effective/treatment administered in both groups is effective)
3. Misleading extrapolation (i.e., overgeneralization of study results in news stories to different populations, treatments or outcomes that were not assessed in the study)
    * Inadequate extrapolation to larger population, intervention, or outcome
    * Inadequate implications for clinical practice
    * No mentions of further investigation being necessary to confirm present findings

    * Abstract: Objective: To report 12-month outcomes from a multidisciplinary child obesity intervention program, targeting high-risk groups.

Methods: In this unblinded randomized controlled trial, participants (recruited January 2012-August 2014) were aged 5 to 16 years, resided in Taranaki, Aotearoa/New Zealand, and had BMI ≥ 98th percentile or BMI > 91st percentile with weight-related comorbidities. Randomization was by minimization (age and ethnicity), with participants assigned to an intense intervention group (home-based assessments at 6-month intervals and a 12-month multidisciplinary program with weekly group sessions) or to a minimal-intensity control group with home-based assessments and advice at each 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome was the change in BMI standard deviation score (SDS) at 12 months from baseline. A mixed model analysis was undertaken, incorporating all 6- and 12-month data.

Results: Two hundred and three children were randomly assigned (47% Māori, 43% New Zealand European, 53% female, 28% from the most deprived quintile, mean age 10.7 years, mean BMI SDS 3.12). Both groups displayed a change in BMI SDS at 12 months from baseline (-0.12 control, -0.10 intervention), improvements in cardiovascular fitness (P < 0.0001), and improvements in quality of life (P < 0.001). Achieving ≥ 70% attendance in the intense intervention group resulted in a change in BMI SDS of -0.22.

Conclusions: This program achieved a high recruitment of target groups and a high rate of BMI SDS reduction, irrespective of intervention intensity. If retention is optimized, the intensive program doubles its effect.

    * Title: Low-dose ketamine vs morphine for acute pain in the ED: a randomized controlled trial.
    * Abstract: Objectives
To compare the maximum change in numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores, in patients receiving low-dose ketamine (LDK) or morphine (MOR) for acute pain in the emergency department.
Methods
We performed an institutional review board–approved, randomized, prospective, double-blinded trial at a tertiary, level 1 trauma center. A convenience sample of patients aged 18 to 59 years with acute abdominal, flank, low back, or extremity pain were enrolled. Subjects were consented and randomized to intravenous LDK (0.3 mg/kg) or intravenous MOR (0.1 mg/kg). Our primary outcome was the maximum change in NRS scores. A sample size of 20 subjects per group was calculated based on an 80% power to detect a 2-point change in NRS scores between treatment groups with estimated SDs of 2 and an α of .05, using a repeated-measures linear model.
Results
Forty-five subjects were enrolled (MOR 21, LDK 24). Demographic variables and baseline NRS scores (7.1 vs 7.1) were similar. Ketamine was not superior to MOR in the maximum change of NRS pain scores, MOR = 5 (confidence interval, 6.6-3.5) and LDK = 4.9 (confidence interval, 5.8-4). The time to achieve maximum reduction in NRS pain scores was at 5 minutes for LDK and 100 minutes for MOR. Vital signs, adverse events, provider, and nurse satisfaction scores were similar between groups.
Conclusion
Low-dose ketamine did not produce a greater reduction in NRS pain scores compared with MOR for acute pain in the emergency department. However, LDK induced a significant analgesic effect within 5 minutes and provided a moderate reduction in pain for 2 hours.

    * Title: Intraarticular analgesia versus epidural plus femoral nerve block after TKA: a randomized, double-blind trial.
    * Abstract: Background
Pain management after TKA remains challenging and the efficacy of continuously infused intraarticular anesthetics remains a controversial topic.

Questions/purposes
We compared the side effect profile, analgesic efficacy, and functional recovery between patients receiving a continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine and patients receiving an epidural plus femoral nerve block (FNB) after TKA.

Methods
Ninety-four patients undergoing unilateral TKA were prospectively randomized to receive a spinal-epidural analgesic infusion plus a single-injection FNB or a spinal anesthetic plus a continuous postoperative intraarticular infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine. All patients were blinded to their treatment with placebo saline catheters. Blinded coinvestigators collected data concerning side effect profiles (nausea, hypotension), analgesic efficacy (VAS pain scores, narcotic usage), and functional recovery (timed up and go test, quadriceps strength, WOMAC scores, Knee Society scores, early postoperative ambulatory ability, in-hospital falls). All complications and adverse events were recorded.

Results
The frequency of nausea and hypertension was not different between the study groups. During the first 12 and 24 postoperative hours, the mean maximum VAS pain scores were higher in the ropivacaine group than in the epidural group (first 12 hours: 3.93 versus 1.14, respectively, p < 0.0001; 12–24 hours: 3.52 versus 1.93, respectively, p = 0.008). After 24 hours, pain scores were similar between groups. Narcotic consumption was significantly higher in the ropivacaine group on the day of surgery, but overall in-hospital narcotic usage was similar between groups. There were no clinically important differences in functional recovery between groups at any time point, but patients in the epidural group were more likely to have knee buckling (32.7% versus 6.7%, p = 0.002) and delayed ambulation (16.3% versus 0.0%, p = 0.006) than patients in the ropivacaine group, though not in-hospital falls. No infections occurred in either group, and the frequency of complications was not different between groups.

Conclusions
A continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine can be recommended as a safe, effective alternative to epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB after TKA. Improved analgesic efficacy in the group that received epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB must be weighed against the disadvantage of a higher likelihood of knee buckling and delayed ambulation with that treatment approach.
    * Strategies: CONCLUSION: Claim equivalence/non-inferiority versus control for a (-) endpoint

Title: Assessing the Cost-effectiveness of Problem-Solving Treatment for Primary Care Mental Health: A Randomized Trial
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Mental health problems are prevalent and linked to increased disability and healthcare expenses. Problem-Solving Treatment (PST) administered by nurses in primary care could offer an efficient solution. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of PST compared to usual care (UC) provided by general practitioners for primary care patients with mental health issues.

METHODS: An economic evaluation from a societal perspective was conducted alongside a randomized clinical trial. Eligible patients had a positive General Health Questionnaire score (≥4) and had visited their general practitioner at least three times in the past six months. Outcome measures included improvement on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and QALYs based on the EQ-5D. Resource use was measured using a validated questionnaire. Missing cost and effect data were imputed using multiple imputation techniques. Bootstrapping was used to analyze costs and cost-effectiveness of PST compared with UC.

RESULTS: Although there were no statistically significant differences in clinical outcomes at 9 months, mean total costs were €4795 in the PST group and €6857 in the UC group. Costs were not statistically significantly different between the two groups (95% CI -4698;359). The cost-effectiveness analysis suggested that PST might be cost-effective compared to UC. Sensitivity analyses supported these findings.

CONCLUSIONS: PST delivered by nurses appears to be a cost-effective alternative to UC, though results should be cautiously interpreted due to the influence of outliers with high indirect costs in the UC group.

29491586,5827507,Comparative clinical evaluation of gallium-aluminum-arsenide diode laser and potassium nitrate in treating dentinal hypersensitivity.,"ABSTRACT.CONTEXT::
Dentinal hypersensitivity (DH) is a chronic disorder in which patients report sharp and acute pain to a variety of stimuli. Till date, a standardized procedure to treat DH is missing, though several alternative treatment strategies have been designed, including laser therapies.

ABSTRACT.AIM::
The aim of the study was to treat DH with minimum chemical concentration and least laser energy level with longer follow-up period.

ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS::
One hundred and twenty patients were randomly divided into four groups: (i) Group 1-5% potassium nitrate (KNO3); (ii) Group 2 - gallium-aluminum-arsenide diode laser (62.2 J/cm2, wavelength - 980 nm, noncontact pulse mode, and power wattage - 0.5 W); (iii) Group 3 - combined 5% KNO3 and the diode laser; and (iv) Group 4 - placebo (control). The visual analog scale (VAS) scores were recorded, analyzed, and compared to tactile stimuli, cold water, and air blast tests at different intervals for 6 weeks.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS::
Synergistic use of 5% KNO3 and diode laser (Group 3) significantly reduced the DH pain, which was almost negligible after 6th week (97%‚Äì99% of the pain was reported to be relieved) and showed promising results than any other studied groups. Further, the diode laser (Group 2) showed better results than 5% KNO3 (Group 1). One-way ANOVA and Bonferroni correction post hoc test revealed the combination of groups with significant differences in the mean VAS scores at the different interval of time (P &lt; 0.01).

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS::
Convincingly, the combined application of 5% KNO3 with the diode laser can be recommended for treating DH patients.",gpt4o-generated-long-detailed-with-rationale-change-results-conclusions-example-abstracts-temp0_6-p0_7,"system prompt: You are an expert in the field of health sciences. user prompt: Spin is misrepresentation of study results which involves overstating (exaggerating) the efficacy and/or understating the harms.

    * Abstract: Objective: To report 12-month outcomes from a multidisciplinary child obesity intervention program, targeting high-risk groups.

Methods: In this unblinded randomized controlled trial, participants (recruited January 2012-August 2014) were aged 5 to 16 years, resided in Taranaki, Aotearoa/New Zealand, and had BMI ≥ 98th percentile or BMI > 91st percentile with weight-related comorbidities. Randomization was by minimization (age and ethnicity), with participants assigned to an intense intervention group (home-based assessments at 6-month intervals and a 12-month multidisciplinary program with weekly group sessions) or to a minimal-intensity control group with home-based assessments and advice at each 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome was the change in BMI standard deviation score (SDS) at 12 months from baseline. A mixed model analysis was undertaken, incorporating all 6- and 12-month data.

Results: Two hundred and three children were randomly assigned (47% Māori, 43% New Zealand European, 53% female, 28% from the most deprived quintile, mean age 10.7 years, mean BMI SDS 3.12). Both groups displayed a change in BMI SDS at 12 months from baseline (-0.12 control, -0.10 intervention), improvements in cardiovascular fitness (P < 0.0001), and improvements in quality of life (P < 0.001). Achieving ≥ 70% attendance in the intense intervention group resulted in a change in BMI SDS of -0.22.

Conclusions: This program achieved a high recruitment of target groups and a high rate of BMI SDS reduction, irrespective of intervention intensity. If retention is optimized, the intensive program doubles its effect.

    * Title: Low-dose ketamine vs morphine for acute pain in the ED: a randomized controlled trial.
    * Abstract: Objectives
To compare the maximum change in numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores, in patients receiving low-dose ketamine (LDK) or morphine (MOR) for acute pain in the emergency department.
Methods
We performed an institutional review board–approved, randomized, prospective, double-blinded trial at a tertiary, level 1 trauma center. A convenience sample of patients aged 18 to 59 years with acute abdominal, flank, low back, or extremity pain were enrolled. Subjects were consented and randomized to intravenous LDK (0.3 mg/kg) or intravenous MOR (0.1 mg/kg). Our primary outcome was the maximum change in NRS scores. A sample size of 20 subjects per group was calculated based on an 80% power to detect a 2-point change in NRS scores between treatment groups with estimated SDs of 2 and an α of .05, using a repeated-measures linear model.
Results
Forty-five subjects were enrolled (MOR 21, LDK 24). Demographic variables and baseline NRS scores (7.1 vs 7.1) were similar. Ketamine was not superior to MOR in the maximum change of NRS pain scores, MOR = 5 (confidence interval, 6.6-3.5) and LDK = 4.9 (confidence interval, 5.8-4). The time to achieve maximum reduction in NRS pain scores was at 5 minutes for LDK and 100 minutes for MOR. Vital signs, adverse events, provider, and nurse satisfaction scores were similar between groups.
Conclusion
Low-dose ketamine did not produce a greater reduction in NRS pain scores compared with MOR for acute pain in the emergency department. However, LDK induced a significant analgesic effect within 5 minutes and provided a moderate reduction in pain for 2 hours.

    * Title: Intraarticular analgesia versus epidural plus femoral nerve block after TKA: a randomized, double-blind trial.
    * Abstract: Background
Pain management after TKA remains challenging and the efficacy of continuously infused intraarticular anesthetics remains a controversial topic.

Questions/purposes
We compared the side effect profile, analgesic efficacy, and functional recovery between patients receiving a continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine and patients receiving an epidural plus femoral nerve block (FNB) after TKA.

Methods
Ninety-four patients undergoing unilateral TKA were prospectively randomized to receive a spinal-epidural analgesic infusion plus a single-injection FNB or a spinal anesthetic plus a continuous postoperative intraarticular infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine. All patients were blinded to their treatment with placebo saline catheters. Blinded coinvestigators collected data concerning side effect profiles (nausea, hypotension), analgesic efficacy (VAS pain scores, narcotic usage), and functional recovery (timed up and go test, quadriceps strength, WOMAC scores, Knee Society scores, early postoperative ambulatory ability, in-hospital falls). All complications and adverse events were recorded.

Results
The frequency of nausea and hypertension was not different between the study groups. During the first 12 and 24 postoperative hours, the mean maximum VAS pain scores were higher in the ropivacaine group than in the epidural group (first 12 hours: 3.93 versus 1.14, respectively, p < 0.0001; 12–24 hours: 3.52 versus 1.93, respectively, p = 0.008). After 24 hours, pain scores were similar between groups. Narcotic consumption was significantly higher in the ropivacaine group on the day of surgery, but overall in-hospital narcotic usage was similar between groups. There were no clinically important differences in functional recovery between groups at any time point, but patients in the epidural group were more likely to have knee buckling (32.7% versus 6.7%, p = 0.002) and delayed ambulation (16.3% versus 0.0%, p = 0.006) than patients in the ropivacaine group, though not in-hospital falls. No infections occurred in either group, and the frequency of complications was not different between groups.

Conclusions
A continuous intraarticular infusion of ropivacaine can be recommended as a safe, effective alternative to epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB after TKA. Improved analgesic efficacy in the group that received epidural analgesia plus single-injection FNB must be weighed against the disadvantage of a higher likelihood of knee buckling and delayed ambulation with that treatment approach.
    * Strategies: CONCLUSION: Claim equivalence/non-inferiority versus control for a (-) endpoint

Title: Evaluating Gallium-Aluminum-Arsenide Diode Laser and Potassium Nitrate for Dentinal Hypersensitivity: A Randomized Trial
Abstract: ABSTRACT.CONTEXT::
Dentinal hypersensitivity (DH) is a chronic disorder in which patients report sharp and acute pain to a variety of stimuli. Till date, a standardized procedure to treat DH is missing, though several alternative treatment strategies have been designed, including laser therapies.

ABSTRACT.AIM::
The aim of the study was to treat DH with minimum chemical concentration and least laser energy level with longer follow-up period.

ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS::
One hundred and twenty patients were randomly divided into four groups: (i) Group 1-5% potassium nitrate (KNO3); (ii) Group 2 - gallium-aluminum-arsenide diode laser (62.2 J/cm2, wavelength - 980 nm, noncontact pulse mode, and power wattage - 0.5 W); (iii) Group 3 - combined 5% KNO3 and the diode laser; and (iv) Group 4 - placebo (control). The visual analog scale (VAS) scores were recorded, analyzed, and compared to tactile stimuli, cold water, and air blast tests at different intervals for 6 weeks.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS::
The combination of 5% KNO3 and diode laser (Group 3) resulted in a substantial reduction in DH pain, showing significant improvements over the study period. The diode laser alone (Group 2) also demonstrated efficacy, outperforming 5% KNO3 (Group 1). Statistical analysis confirmed significant differences in mean VAS scores across groups and time points (P < 0.01).

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS::
The combined use of 5% KNO3 and diode laser shows promise for treating DH, with significant pain reduction observed over the study duration.
