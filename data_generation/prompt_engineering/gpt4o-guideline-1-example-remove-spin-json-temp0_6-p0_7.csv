21731251,3118076,The efficacy of flapless implant surgery on soft-tissue profile comparing immediate loading implants to delayed loading implants: A comparative clinical study.,"ABSTRACT.AIMS AND OBJECTIVES.
To assess the efficacy of flapless implant surgery on soft-tissue profile and to compare the clinical outcomes of flapless implant therapy on immediate loading (IL) implants to delayed loading (DL) implants.

ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS.
The study sample consisted of 20 patients who were partially edentulous in the anterior maxillary region. They were divided into two groups. In group I (IL) 10 implants were placed and immediately provisionalized and restored with a metal ceramic crown on the 14th day. In group II (DL) 10 implants were placed and loaded after 4 months. Single-piece implants were used for the IL group and two-piece implants were used for the DL group. All soft tissue parameters i.e., modified plaque index (mPI), modified bleeding index (mBI), papillary index (PPI), marginal level of soft tissue (ML) and width of keratinized mucosa (WKM) were recorded at baseline, Day 60, Day 120 and Day 180.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.
The success rate in group I was found to be 80%, which was lower than the success rate in group II which was found to be 90%. On comparison, there is no statistically significant difference in success rate between the two study groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups over time in parameters like mPI, mBI, ML and WKM. The mean PPI score in group II showed a significant increase from when compared to group I.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:.
The results of this study indicated that flapless implant surgery using either immediately loading implants or DL implants, demonstrate enhancement of implant esthetics.",gpt4o-guideline-1-example-remove-spin-json-temp0_6-p0_7,"system prompt: You are an expert in the field of health sciences. user prompt: Rewrite the provided abstract to remove any instances of spin.

24523939,3921228,Real-time FMRI neurofeedback training of amygdala activity in patients with major depressive disorder.,"ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
Amygdala hemodynamic responses to positive stimuli are attenuated in major depressive disorder (MDD), and normalize with remission. Real-time functional MRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) offers a non-invasive method to modulate this regional activity. We examined whether depressed participants can use rtfMRI-nf to enhance amygdala responses to positive autobiographical memories, and whether this ability alters symptom severity.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
Unmedicated MDD subjects were assigned to receive rtfMRI-nf from either left amygdala (LA; experimental group, n = 14) or the horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus (HIPS; control group, n = 7) and instructed to contemplate happy autobiographical memories (AMs) to raise the level of a bar representing the hemodynamic signal from the target region to a target level. This 40s Happy condition alternated with 40s blocks of rest and counting backwards. A final Transfer run without neurofeedback information was included.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
Participants in the experimental group upregulated their amygdala responses during positive AM recall. Significant pre-post scan decreases in anxiety ratings and increases in happiness ratings were evident in the experimental versus control group. A whole brain analysis showed that during the transfer run, participants in the experimental group had increased activity compared to the control group in left superior temporal gyrus and temporal polar cortex, and right thalamus.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
Using rtfMRI-nf from the left amygdala during recall of positive AMs, depressed subjects were able to self-regulate their amygdala response, resulting in improved mood. Results from this proof-of-concept study suggest that rtfMRI-nf training with positive AM recall holds potential as a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of depression.",gpt4o-guideline-1-example-remove-spin-json-temp0_6-p0_7,"system prompt: You are an expert in the field of health sciences. user prompt: Rewrite the provided abstract to remove any instances of spin.

23225932,3511949,Comparison of efficacy of intra-articular morphine and steroid in patients with knee osteoarthritis.,"ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION:.
Primary therapeutic aim in treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee is to relieve the pain of osteoarthritis. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of intra-articular triamcinolone with intra-articular morphine in pain relief due to osteoarthritis of the knee in the elderly population.

ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:.
Patients between 50 and 80 years of age were randomized into three groups. Group M received morphine plus bupivacaine intra-articularly, Group T received triamcinolone plus bupivacaine intra-articularly, and Group C received saline plus bupivacaine intra-articularly. Patients were evaluated before injection and in 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 12th weeks after injection. First-line supplementary analgesic was oral paracetamol 1500 mg/day. If analgesia was insufficient with paracetamol, oral dexketoprofen trometamol 50 mg/day was recommended to patients.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.
After the intra-articular injection, there was statistically significant decrease in visual analog scale (VAS) scores in Groups M and T, when compared to Group C. The decrease of VAS scores seen at the first 2 weeks continued steadily up to the end of 12th week. There was a significant decrease in Groups M and T in the WOMAC scores, when compared to Group C. There was no significant difference in the WOMAC scores between morphine and steroid groups. Significantly less supplementary analgesics was used in the morphine and steroid groups.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:.
Intra-articular morphine was as effective as intra-articular triamcinolone for analgesia in patients with osteoarthritis knee. Intra-articular morphine is possibly a better option than intra-articular steroid as it has lesser side effects.",gpt4o-guideline-1-example-remove-spin-json-temp0_6-p0_7,"system prompt: You are an expert in the field of health sciences. user prompt: Rewrite the provided abstract to remove any instances of spin.

Artemisinin combination therapies are available in private outlets, but patient adherence might be compromised by poor advice from dispensers. In this cluster randomized trial in drug shops in Tanzania, 42 of 82 selected shops were randomized to receive text message reminders about what advice to provide when dispensing artemether-lumefantrine (AL). Eligible patients purchasing AL at shops in both arms were followed up at home and questioned about each dose taken. Dispensers were interviewed regarding knowledge of AL dispensing practices and receipt of the malaria-related text messages. We interviewed 904 patients and 110 dispensers from 77 shops. Although there was some improvement in dispenser knowledge, there was no difference between arms in adherence measured as completion of all doses (intervention 68.3%, control 69.8%, p [adjusted] = 0.6), or as completion of each dose at the correct time (intervention 33.1%, control 32.6%, p [adjusted] = 0.9).

27006535,4784207,Efficacy of a separate informed consent for anesthesia services: A prospective study from the Caribbean.,"ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND AND AIMS:.
This study aimed to determine whether a separate written consent form improved the efficacy of the informed consent process for anesthesia in adult patients undergoing elective surgery at a tertiary care teaching hospital.

ABSTRACT.MATERIAL AND METHODS:.
We randomized patients into two groups prospectively. The first group (Group A) signed the hospital's standard Consent for Operation form only while the second group (Group B) signed a separate Consent for Anesthesia form additionally. Patients were interviewed postoperatively with an eight-item questionnaire with responses in a 5-point Likert scale. A composite adequacy of consent index was generated from the responses and analyzed.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.
Two hundred patients (100 in each group) were studied. All patients indicated that the anesthesiologist(s) had their permission to proceed with their anesthesia care. The mean adequacy of consent index score in Group B was higher than that of Group A (30.6 ¬± 4.6 [standard deviation (SD)] vs. 27.9 ¬± 5.2 [SD]) (P &lt; 0.001). The separate written consent had a positive impact on the patients' understanding of the nature and purpose of the intended anesthesia procedures (P = 0.04), satisfaction with the adequacy of information provided about common side effects (P &lt; 0.001) and rare but serious complications (P = 0.008).

22954348,3814649,"Vitrification of immature bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes: effects of cryoprotectants, the vitrification procedure and warming time on cleavage and embryo development.","ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
The present studies evaluated the effects of cryoprotectants, the vitrification procedure and time in the warming solution containing sucrose on cleavage and embryo development of immature (GV stage) bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs).

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
Two experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, COCs (n = 420) were randomly assigned to four groups: 1) Control group: no treatment; 2) VS1 group: COCs were exposed to vitrification solution 1 (VS1) containing 7.5% ethylene glycol [EG] + 7.5% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] + 20% calf serum [CS] in TCM-199 at 37 C for 5 min; 3) VS1 + VS2 group: COCs were exposed to VS1 for 5 min followed by VS2 (15% EG + 15% DMSO + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS) at 37 C for 45‚Äì60 sec; and 4) Vitrified group: COCs were exposed to VS1 and VS2, loaded on cryotops, vitrified in liquid nitrogen and then warmed in TCM-199 + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS at 37 C for 1 min. In Experiment 2, COCs (n = 581) were assigned to the same groups, but those in VS1, VS1 + VS2 and Vitrified groups were sub-divided and exposed to the warming solution for either 1 or 5 min. After treatment and/or warming, all COCs in both experiments underwent in vitro maturation, in vitro fertilization and in vitro culture.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
Cleavage and blastocyst rates did not differ among Control, VS1 and VS1 + VS2 groups in either experiment. In Experiment 2, there was no effect of time in the warming solution.  However, both cleavage and blastocyst rates were lower (P &lt; 0.001) in the Vitrified group than in the Control, VS1 and VS1 + VS2 groups (40.9 and 1.6% vs 92.2 and 34.4%, 79.4 and 25.2%, and 80.2 and 20.8%, respectively in Experiment 1, and 25.0 and 1.7% vs 75.3 and 27.2%, 67.9 and 19.5%, and 62.7 and 22.5%, respectively in Experiment 2).

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
The permeating cryoprotectants (EG and DMSO) present in VS1 and VS2 solutions and the time in the warming solution containing sucrose had no adverse effects on cleavage and blastocyst rates of immature bovine COCs.

26509605,4624894,24 versus 48 Weeks of Peginterferon Plus Ribavirin in Hepatitis C Virus Genotype 6 Chronically Infected Patients with a Rapid Virological Response: A Non-Inferiority Randomized Controlled Trial.,"ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES.
The optimal treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 6 is unclear owing to its limited geographic distribution. Because of a high predictive value of rapid virological response (RVR) for sustained virological response (SVR), we conducted an open-label randomized controlled trial to compare 24- and 48-week peginterferon/ribavirin combination therapy for patients with HCV genotype 6 in Southern China who achieved an RVR.

ABSTRACT.METHODS AND FINDINGS.
Treatment-naive, non-cirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 6 were treated with pegylated interferon Œ±-2a (180 Œºg/week) and ribavirin (800‚Äì1,200 mg, according to weight) for 4 weeks. Patients who achieved an RVR, which was defined as HCV RNA negativity at week 4 (&lt;50 IU), were randomized to receive either an additional 20 or 44 weeks of treatment (24- and 48-week treatment groups, respectively). The primary outcome measure was SVR. From January 2011 to June 2014, 152(152/210, 72.4%) patients with HCV genotype 6a and RVR were randomized 1:1 to the 24- or 48-week treatment group. The SVR rates in the 24- and 48-week groups in the intention-to-treat analysis were 90.8% (69/76) and 88.2% (67/76), respectively; those in the per-protocol analysis were 95.7% (67/70) and 97.0% (64/66), respectively. More patients in the 48-week group had anemia (46.1% vs. 28.9%, P = 0.03), but other adverse events were comparable between the groups. The limitation of the present study was that only patients from Southern China were enrolled which may inhibit the extensive application of the findings.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.
Twenty-four weeks of peginterferon/ribavirin combination therapy was non-inferior to 48 weeks in patients with HCV genotype 6a in Southern China who achieved an RVR.

26215396,4517637,The effect of short-term high versus normal protein intake on whole-body protein synthesis and balance in children following cardiac surgery: a randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial.,"ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
Infants undergoing cardiac surgery are at risk of a negative protein balance, due to increased proteolysis in response to surgery and the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit, and limited intake. The aim of the study was to quantify the effect on protein kinetics of a short-term high-protein (HP) diet in infants following cardiac surgery.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
In a prospective, double-blinded, randomized trial we compared the effects of a HP (5 g ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ d‚àí1) versus normal protein (NP, 2 g ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ d‚àí1) enteral diet on protein kinetics in children &lt;24 months, on day 2 following surgical repair of congenital heart disease. Valine kinetics and fractional albumin synthesis rate (FSRalb) were measured with mass spectrometry using [1-13C]valine infusion. The Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test was used to investigate differences between group medians. Additionally, the Hodges-Lehmann procedure was used to create a confidence interval with a point estimate of median differences between groups.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
Twenty-eight children (median age 9 months, median weight 7 kg) participated in the study, of whom in only 20 subjects isotopic data could be used for final calculations. Due to underpowering of our study, we could not draw conclusions on the primary outcome parameters. We observed valine synthesis rate of 2.73 (range: 0.94 to 3.36) and 2.26 (1.85 to 2.73) Œºmol ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ min‚àí1 in the HP and NP diet, respectively. The net valine balance was 0.54 (‚àí0.73 to 1.75) and 0.24 (‚àí0.20 to 0.63) Œºmol ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ min‚àí1 in the HP and NP group. Between groups, there was no difference in FSRalb. We observed increased oxidation and BUN in the HP diet, compared to the NP diet, as a plausible explanation of the metabolic fate of surplus protein.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
It is plausible that the surplus protein in the HP group has caused the increase of valine oxidation and ureagenesis, compared to the NP group. Because too few patients had completed the study, we were unable to draw conclusions on the effect of a HP diet on protein synthesis and balance. We present our results as new hypothesis generating data.

METHODS. In a double-blinded, randomized trial, we compared HP (5 g/kg/day) versus normal protein (NP, 2 g/kg/day) diets on protein kinetics in children <24 months, post-cardiac surgery. Valine kinetics and fractional albumin synthesis rate (FSRalb) were measured using [1-13C]valine infusion. The Mann–Whitney U test assessed group median differences, and the Hodges-Lehmann procedure provided confidence intervals for median differences.

RESULTS. Twenty-eight children (median age 9 months, median weight 7 kg) participated, with isotopic data from 20 subjects used for final calculations. Due to underpowering, conclusions on primary outcomes were not possible. Valine synthesis rates were 2.73 (range: 0.94 to 3.36) and 2.26 (1.85 to 2.73) μmol/kg/min for HP and NP diets, respectively. Net valine balance was 0.54 (−0.73 to 1.75) and 0.24 (−0.20 to 0.63) μmol/kg/min for HP and NP groups. No difference in FSRalb was observed between groups. Increased oxidation and BUN in the HP diet suggested surplus protein metabolism.

CONCLUSIONS. The HP diet led to increased valine oxidation and ureagenesis compared to NP. Insufficient patient numbers prevented conclusions on the HP diet's effect on protein synthesis and balance. Results may inform future hypotheses.

23052105,3515338,Cost-effectiveness of problem-solving treatment in comparison with usual care for primary care patients with mental health problems: a randomized trial.,"ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
Mental health problems are common and are associated with increased disability and health care costs. Problem-Solving Treatment (PST) delivered to these patients by nurses in primary care might be efficient. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PST by mental health nurses compared with usual care (UC) by the general practitioner for primary care patients with mental health problems.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
An economic evaluation from a societal perspective was performed alongside a randomized clinical trial. Patients with a positive General Health Questionnaire score (score ‚â• 4) and who visited their general practitioner at least three times during the past 6 months were eligible. Outcome measures were improvement on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and QALYs based on the EQ-5D. Resource use was measured using a validated questionnaire. Missing cost and effect data were imputed using multiple imputation techniques. Bootstrapping was used to analyze costs and cost-effectiveness of PST compared with UC.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
There were no statistically significant differences in clinical outcomes at 9 months. Mean total costs were ‚Ç¨4795 in the PST group and ‚Ç¨6857 in the UC group. Costs were not statistically significantly different between the two groups (95% CI -4698;359). The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that PST was cost-effective in comparison with UC. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
PST delivered by nurses seems cost-effective in comparison with UC. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, since the difference in total costs was mainly caused by 3 outliers with extremely high indirect costs in the UC group.

* In the Context section:
    * Delete all information that could distort the understanding of the aim of the trial.
        * The aim is to evaluate the treatment effect on a secondary outcome.
        * The aim is to evaluate the treatment effect for a subgroup.

* In the Methods section:
    * Clearly report the primary outcome.
    * According to space constraints, report all secondary outcomes evaluated in the Methods section or report no secondary outcome evaluated in the Methods section to avoid specifically highlighting statistically significant secondary outcomes.
    * Delete information that could distort the understanding of the aim (eg, within-group comparison, modified population analysis, subgroup analysis).
* In the Results section:
    * Delete subgroup analyses that were not prespecified, based on the primary outcome, and interpreted in light of the totality of prespecified subgroup analyses undertaken.
    * Delete within-group comparisons.
    * Delete linguistic spin.
    * Report the results for the primary outcome with numbers in both arms (if possible with some measure of variability) with no wording of judgment.
    * Report results for all secondary outcomes, for no secondary outcome, or for the most clinically important secondary outcome.
    * Report safety data including reason for withdrawals; report treatment discontinuation when applicable.

29491586,5827507,Comparative clinical evaluation of gallium-aluminum-arsenide diode laser and potassium nitrate in treating dentinal hypersensitivity.,"ABSTRACT.CONTEXT::
Dentinal hypersensitivity (DH) is a chronic disorder in which patients report sharp and acute pain to a variety of stimuli. Till date, a standardized procedure to treat DH is missing, though several alternative treatment strategies have been designed, including laser therapies.

ABSTRACT.AIM::
The aim of the study was to treat DH with minimum chemical concentration and least laser energy level with longer follow-up period.

ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS::
One hundred and twenty patients were randomly divided into four groups: (i) Group 1-5% potassium nitrate (KNO3); (ii) Group 2 - gallium-aluminum-arsenide diode laser (62.2 J/cm2, wavelength - 980 nm, noncontact pulse mode, and power wattage - 0.5 W); (iii) Group 3 - combined 5% KNO3 and the diode laser; and (iv) Group 4 - placebo (control). The visual analog scale (VAS) scores were recorded, analyzed, and compared to tactile stimuli, cold water, and air blast tests at different intervals for 6 weeks.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS::
Synergistic use of 5% KNO3 and diode laser (Group 3) significantly reduced the DH pain, which was almost negligible after 6th week (97%‚Äì99% of the pain was reported to be relieved) and showed promising results than any other studied groups. Further, the diode laser (Group 2) showed better results than 5% KNO3 (Group 1). One-way ANOVA and Bonferroni correction post hoc test revealed the combination of groups with significant differences in the mean VAS scores at the different interval of time (P &lt; 0.01).

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS::
Convincingly, the combined application of 5% KNO3 with the diode laser can be recommended for treating DH patients.",gpt4o-guideline-1-example-remove-spin-json-temp0_6-p0_7,"system prompt: You are an expert in the field of health sciences. user prompt: Rewrite the provided abstract to remove any instances of spin.
