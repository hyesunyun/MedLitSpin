0,21731251,3118076,The efficacy of flapless implant surgery on soft-tissue profile comparing immediate loading implants to delayed loading implants: A comparative clinical study.,"ABSTRACT.AIMS AND OBJECTIVES.
To assess the efficacy of flapless implant surgery on soft-tissue profile and to compare the clinical outcomes of flapless implant therapy on immediate loading (IL) implants to delayed loading (DL) implants.

ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS.
The study sample consisted of 20 patients who were partially edentulous in the anterior maxillary region. They were divided into two groups. In group I (IL) 10 implants were placed and immediately provisionalized and restored with a metal ceramic crown on the 14th day. In group II (DL) 10 implants were placed and loaded after 4 months. Single-piece implants were used for the IL group and two-piece implants were used for the DL group. All soft tissue parameters i.e., modified plaque index (mPI), modified bleeding index (mBI), papillary index (PPI), marginal level of soft tissue (ML) and width of keratinized mucosa (WKM) were recorded at baseline, Day 60, Day 120 and Day 180.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.
The success rate in group I was found to be 80%, which was lower than the success rate in group II which was found to be 90%. On comparison, there is no statistically significant difference in success rate between the two study groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups over time in parameters like mPI, mBI, ML and WKM. The mean PPI score in group II showed a significant increase from when compared to group I.

1,24523939,3921228,Real-time FMRI neurofeedback training of amygdala activity in patients with major depressive disorder.,"ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
Amygdala hemodynamic responses to positive stimuli are attenuated in major depressive disorder (MDD), and normalize with remission. Real-time functional MRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) offers a non-invasive method to modulate this regional activity. We examined whether depressed participants can use rtfMRI-nf to enhance amygdala responses to positive autobiographical memories, and whether this ability alters symptom severity.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
Unmedicated MDD subjects were assigned to receive rtfMRI-nf from either left amygdala (LA; experimental group, n = 14) or the horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus (HIPS; control group, n = 7) and instructed to contemplate happy autobiographical memories (AMs) to raise the level of a bar representing the hemodynamic signal from the target region to a target level. This 40s Happy condition alternated with 40s blocks of rest and counting backwards. A final Transfer run without neurofeedback information was included.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
Participants in the experimental group upregulated their amygdala responses during positive AM recall. Significant pre-post scan decreases in anxiety ratings and increases in happiness ratings were evident in the experimental versus control group. A whole brain analysis showed that during the transfer run, participants in the experimental group had increased activity compared to the control group in left superior temporal gyrus and temporal polar cortex, and right thalamus.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
Using rtfMRI-nf from the left amygdala during recall of positive AMs, depressed subjects were able to self-regulate their amygdala response, resulting in improved mood. Results from this proof-of-concept study suggest that rtfMRI-nf training with positive AM recall holds potential as a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of depression.",gpt4o-generated-long-summarized,"system prompt: You are an expert in the field of health sciences. user prompt: Spin is misrepresentation of study results which involves overstating (exaggerating) the efficacy and/or understating the harms.

Title: Optimizing Amygdala Responsiveness in MDD via Real-time fMRI Neurofeedback
Abstract: BACKGROUND. MDD is associated with decreased amygdala responses to positive stimuli, which normalize with symptom remission. Real-time functional MRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) presents a promising approach to gently enhance regional activity. This study explored the capacity of depressed participants to use rtfMRI-nf to boost amygdala responses during positive autobiographical memory recall and examined potential impacts on symptom severity.

METHODS. Unmedicated MDD subjects were randomized to receive rtfMRI-nf targeting either the left amygdala (LA; experimental group, n = 14) or the intraparietal sulcus (HIPS; control group, n = 7). Participants engaged in a task of recalling happy autobiographical memories (AMs) to modulate the hemodynamic signal from the target region. This protocol included alternating 40-second periods of recall and rest.

RESULTS. The experimental group demonstrated increased amygdala responses when recalling happy AMs. Notably, pre- to post-intervention anxiety levels decreased, and happiness ratings rose relative to controls. In a transfer run without feedback, heightened brain activity was observed in certain cortical regions, suggesting engagement with the neurofeedback process.

CONCLUSIONS. The study's findings encourage the potential of rtfMRI-nf targeting the amygdala to help participants regulate emotional responses, marking an optimistic avenue for further research into non-invasive MDD therapies.

Title: Promising Results from Real-time fMRI Neurofeedback in Modulating Amygdala Activity in Major Depression
Abstract: BACKGROUND. Dysregulated amygdala responses in MDD improve with symptom remission. Real-time functional MRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) can potentially correct this imbalance. This study investigated the capability of rtfMRI-nf to enhance amygdala activity using positive memories and its effects on depressive symptoms.

METHODS. Unmedicated MDD subjects were randomly assigned to receive rtfMRI-nf focused on the left amygdala (experimental group, n = 14) or the intraparietal sulcus (control group, n = 7). Participants were instructed to bring up happy autobiographical memories (AMs) to increase the hemodynamic signal. The experiment alternated happy AM recall with resting periods.

RESULTS. Participants in the experimental group successfully upregulated amygdala responses during positive AM recall, showing significant reductions in anxiety and increases in happiness compared to controls. A transfer run revealed increased neural activity in multiple brain regions.

CONCLUSIONS. rtfMRI-nf training demonstrated a capacity for significant mood improvement by leveraging amygdala regulation. These promising results suggest the potential of this novel feedback approach as an effective adjunct in MDD treatment.

Title: Revolutionary Potential of Real-time fMRI Neurofeedback in Transforming Amygdala Functioning in Major Depression
Abstract: BACKGROUND. Dysregulated amygdala activity is a core feature in major depressive disorder (MDD), improved upon remission. Real-time functional MRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) offers a groundbreaking method to remediate this dysfunction. The study probes whether rtfMRI-nf can dramatically enhance amygdala functionality through positive memory engagement, leading to symptom improvement.

METHODS. Unmedicated MDD patients participated in an innovative trial, receiving either targeted rtfMRI-nf to the left amygdala (experimental group, n = 14) or the intraparietal sulcus as a control (n = 7). During sessions, subjects recalled happy autobiographical memories (AMs) to maximize the neurofeedback signal. Alternating happy AM recall with rest periods formed the core protocol.

RESULTS. The experimental group achieved substantial upregulation of the amygdala's response during positive AM recall, contributing to notable pre- to post-intervention anxiety reductions and marked happiness increases versus control. Whole-brain analyses during a neurofeedback-free transfer run showed compelling activity enhancements in key regions, implicating a robust neuroadaptive process. The inference of efficacy is only limited by sample size.

CONCLUSIONS. Empirical advantages from rtfMRI-nf signal a transformative capability in major depression therapy, heralding a promising era for non-invasive, targeted interventions to restore emotional balance through amygda-centric strategies.

2,23225932,3511949,Comparison of efficacy of intra-articular morphine and steroid in patients with knee osteoarthritis.,"ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION:.
Primary therapeutic aim in treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee is to relieve the pain of osteoarthritis. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of intra-articular triamcinolone with intra-articular morphine in pain relief due to osteoarthritis of the knee in the elderly population.

ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:.
Patients between 50 and 80 years of age were randomized into three groups. Group M received morphine plus bupivacaine intra-articularly, Group T received triamcinolone plus bupivacaine intra-articularly, and Group C received saline plus bupivacaine intra-articularly. Patients were evaluated before injection and in 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 12th weeks after injection. First-line supplementary analgesic was oral paracetamol 1500 mg/day. If analgesia was insufficient with paracetamol, oral dexketoprofen trometamol 50 mg/day was recommended to patients.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.
After the intra-articular injection, there was statistically significant decrease in visual analog scale (VAS) scores in Groups M and T, when compared to Group C. The decrease of VAS scores seen at the first 2 weeks continued steadily up to the end of 12th week. There was a significant decrease in Groups M and T in the WOMAC scores, when compared to Group C. There was no significant difference in the WOMAC scores between morphine and steroid groups. Significantly less supplementary analgesics was used in the morphine and steroid groups.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:.
Intra-articular morphine was as effective as intra-articular triamcinolone for analgesia in patients with osteoarthritis knee.

Title: Evaluation of Intra-Articular Morphine and Steroid for Knee Osteoarthritis Pain Management
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The primary therapeutic goal in treating knee osteoarthritis is to alleviate pain. This study compared the pain relief efficacy of intra-articular triamcinolone and intra-articular morphine in elderly patients. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients aged 50-80 were randomized into three groups. Group M received morphine plus bupivacaine, Group T received triamcinolone plus bupivacaine, and Group C received saline plus bupivacaine intra-articularly. Evaluations occurred pre-injection and at 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 12th weeks post-injection. Oral paracetamol (1500 mg/day) was the primary supplemental analgesic, with dexketoprofen trometamol (50 mg/day) recommended if additional relief was needed.

RESULTS: Statistically significant reductions in VAS scores were observed in Groups M and T compared to Group C, sustained through the 12th week. Both Groups M and T showed significant decreases in WOMAC scores compared to Group C. No significant differences were noted between morphine and steroid groups in WOMAC scores. Usage of supplementary analgesics was notably reduced in the morphine and steroid groups.

CONCLUSION: Intra-articular morphine provided comparable pain relief to triamcinolone in knee osteoarthritis treatment. Morphine may offer a favorable alternative due to its potentially lower side effect profile.

Title: Cluster randomized trial of text message reminders to retail staff in Tanzanian drug shops: Encouraging trends in dispenser knowledge and patient adherence to artemether-lumefantrine
Abstract: ABSTRACT.
In an effort to reinforce the delivery of high-quality advice for artemether-lumefantrine (AL) dispensation, our cluster randomized trial investigated text message reminders to drug shop staff in Tanzania. Of the 82 selected drug shops, 42 were randomized to receive these targeted reminders. Our study followed 904 patients purchasing AL at these shops, assessing their adherence through home follow-ups, and 110 dispensers were interviewed about their dispensing practices and response to the messages. Results indicate a mild improvement in dispenser knowledge, enhancing their ability to deliver informed advice. While adherence to AL, defined by dose completion (intervention 68.3%, control 69.8%), did not show a statistical difference, the intervention has highlighted the potential role of digital communication in improving healthcare practices. This encouraging finding warrants further exploration into text messaging as a tool to potentiate patient adherence.

4,27006535,4784207,Efficacy of a separate informed consent for anesthesia services: A prospective study from the Caribbean.,"ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND AND AIMS:.
This study aimed to determine whether a separate written consent form improved the efficacy of the informed consent process for anesthesia in adult patients undergoing elective surgery at a tertiary care teaching hospital.

ABSTRACT.MATERIAL AND METHODS:.
We randomized patients into two groups prospectively. The first group (Group A) signed the hospital's standard Consent for Operation form only while the second group (Group B) signed a separate Consent for Anesthesia form additionally. Patients were interviewed postoperatively with an eight-item questionnaire with responses in a 5-point Likert scale. A composite adequacy of consent index was generated from the responses and analyzed.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.
Two hundred patients (100 in each group) were studied. All patients indicated that the anesthesiologist(s) had their permission to proceed with their anesthesia care. The mean adequacy of consent index score in Group B was higher than that of Group A (30.6 ¬± 4.6 [standard deviation (SD)] vs. 27.9 ¬± 5.2 [SD]) (P &lt; 0.001). The separate written consent had a positive impact on the patients' understanding of the nature and purpose of the intended anesthesia procedures (P = 0.04), satisfaction with the adequacy of information provided about common side effects (P &lt; 0.001) and rare but serious complications (P = 0.008).

5,22954348,3814649,"Vitrification of immature bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes: effects of cryoprotectants, the vitrification procedure and warming time on cleavage and embryo development.","ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
The present studies evaluated the effects of cryoprotectants, the vitrification procedure and time in the warming solution containing sucrose on cleavage and embryo development of immature (GV stage) bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs).

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
Two experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, COCs (n = 420) were randomly assigned to four groups: 1) Control group: no treatment; 2) VS1 group: COCs were exposed to vitrification solution 1 (VS1) containing 7.5% ethylene glycol [EG] + 7.5% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] + 20% calf serum [CS] in TCM-199 at 37 C for 5 min; 3) VS1 + VS2 group: COCs were exposed to VS1 for 5 min followed by VS2 (15% EG + 15% DMSO + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS) at 37 C for 45‚Äì60 sec; and 4) Vitrified group: COCs were exposed to VS1 and VS2, loaded on cryotops, vitrified in liquid nitrogen and then warmed in TCM-199 + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS at 37 C for 1 min. In Experiment 2, COCs (n = 581) were assigned to the same groups, but those in VS1, VS1 + VS2 and Vitrified groups were sub-divided and exposed to the warming solution for either 1 or 5 min. After treatment and/or warming, all COCs in both experiments underwent in vitro maturation, in vitro fertilization and in vitro culture.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
Cleavage and blastocyst rates did not differ among Control, VS1 and VS1 + VS2 groups in either experiment. In Experiment 2, there was no effect of time in the warming solution.  However, both cleavage and blastocyst rates were lower (P &lt; 0.001) in the Vitrified group than in the Control, VS1 and VS1 + VS2 groups (40.9 and 1.6% vs 92.2 and 34.4%, 79.4 and 25.2%, and 80.2 and 20.8%, respectively in Experiment 1, and 25.0 and 1.7% vs 75.3 and 27.2%, 67.9 and 19.5%, and 62.7 and 22.5%, respectively in Experiment 2).

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
The permeating cryoprotectants (EG and DMSO) present in VS1 and VS2 solutions and the time in the warming solution containing sucrose had no adverse effects on cleavage and blastocyst rates of immature bovine COCs.

Title: Evaluating Bovine Cumulus-Oocyte Complex Vitrification: Insights into Cryoprotectants and Developmental Outcomes
Abstract: ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
This study explored the impact of different cryoprotectants, the vitrification process, and warming durations using sucrose in enhancing cleavage and embryo development in immature bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs).

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
Two detailed experimental studies were implemented. Experiment 1 involved random allocation of COCs (n = 420) across four distinct groups, including a control and varying cryoprotectant exposures and vitrification techniques. Experiment 2 repeated this design with an extended sample (n = 581) and included sub-group analyses based on warming durations. Subsequent in vitro maturation, fertilization, and culture processes were conducted.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
Cleavage and blastocyst development in non-vitrified groups remained comparable over both experiments, highlighting the non-detrimental effects of cryoprotectant exposure alone. Vitrification influenced outcomes, with reduced metrics noted, yet the innovative use of cryoprotectants demonstrated their reliability in other configurations.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
The strategic deployment of cryoprotectants EG and DMSO within VS1 and VS2 solutions successfully maintained integrity in non-vitrified scenarios, while vitrification steps warrant further refinement to optimize early embryo viability.

6,26509605,4624894,24 versus 48 Weeks of Peginterferon Plus Ribavirin in Hepatitis C Virus Genotype 6 Chronically Infected Patients with a Rapid Virological Response: A Non-Inferiority Randomized Controlled Trial.,"ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES.
The optimal treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 6 is unclear owing to its limited geographic distribution. Because of a high predictive value of rapid virological response (RVR) for sustained virological response (SVR), we conducted an open-label randomized controlled trial to compare 24- and 48-week peginterferon/ribavirin combination therapy for patients with HCV genotype 6 in Southern China who achieved an RVR.

ABSTRACT.METHODS AND FINDINGS.
Treatment-naive, non-cirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 6 were treated with pegylated interferon Œ±-2a (180 Œºg/week) and ribavirin (800‚Äì1,200 mg, according to weight) for 4 weeks. Patients who achieved an RVR, which was defined as HCV RNA negativity at week 4 (&lt;50 IU), were randomized to receive either an additional 20 or 44 weeks of treatment (24- and 48-week treatment groups, respectively). The primary outcome measure was SVR. From January 2011 to June 2014, 152(152/210, 72.4%) patients with HCV genotype 6a and RVR were randomized 1:1 to the 24- or 48-week treatment group. The SVR rates in the 24- and 48-week groups in the intention-to-treat analysis were 90.8% (69/76) and 88.2% (67/76), respectively; those in the per-protocol analysis were 95.7% (67/70) and 97.0% (64/66), respectively. More patients in the 48-week group had anemia (46.1% vs. 28.9%, P = 0.03), but other adverse events were comparable between the groups. The limitation of the present study was that only patients from Southern China were enrolled which may inhibit the extensive application of the findings.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.
Twenty-four weeks of peginterferon/ribavirin combination therapy was non-inferior to 48 weeks in patients with HCV genotype 6a in Southern China who achieved an RVR.

Title: Evaluating the Impact of Methylprednisolone and Lignocaine on Propofol Injection Discomfort in Cardiac Surgery: A Randomized Study
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: 
Propofol (2, 6-di-isopropylphenol) frequently causes discomfort upon injection during anaesthesia induction. This double-blind study was designed to assess the potential benefits of methylprednisolone and lignocaine in alleviating this discomfort in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

METHODS: 
A total of 165 adult patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery were divided into three groups: saline (group S, n = 55), lignocaine 20 mg (Group L, n = 55), and methylprednisolone 125 mg diluted into 2 ml of distilled water (Group MP, n = 55). Following tourniquet application, the occlusion was released, and one-fourth of the total propofol dose (2 mg/kg) was administered at 0.5 ml/s. Pain was assessed using a four-point verbal rating scale, with statistical analysis performed using t-tests and chi-square tests.

RESULTS: 
Pain incidence was reduced to 30.9% with lignocaine and 36.4% with methylprednisolone, compared to 70.9% with saline, demonstrating significant decreases in pain intensity with both treatments (P < 0.012).

CONCLUSION: 
This study indicates that intravenous methylprednisolone offers a comparable level of efficacy to lignocaine in minimizing propofol injection-related discomfort, suggesting a promising alternative for improving patient experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: 
Propofol (2, 6-di-isopropylphenol) injection is often associated with considerable pain, posing a significant hurdle in anaesthesia induction. We conducted this randomized, double-blind prospective study to determine the superior efficacy of methylprednisolone and lignocaine in eliminating this discomfort in cardiac surgery patients.

METHODS: 
Among 165 patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery, participants were randomly assigned to receive saline (group S, n = 55), lignocaine 20 mg (Group L, n = 55), or methylprednisolone 125 mg diluted into 2 ml of distilled water (Group MP, n = 55). Following tourniquet application, and upon release, propofol (2 mg/kg) was delivered at a rate of 0.5 ml/s. Pain was rated using a four-point verbal scale, with data analyzed through Student's t-test and chi-square methods.

RESULTS: 
Significant relief was evident, with lignocaine and methylprednisolone reducing pain incidence to 30.9% and 36.4%, respectively, in stark contrast to the 70.9% observed with saline (P < 0.012). These findings highlight their pivotal role in transforming patient experience, promoting unprecedented comfort during painful procedures.

CONCLUSION: 
Employing intravenous methylprednisolone presents a groundbreaking approach alongside lignocaine, ensuring substantial relief from propofol injection pain, and has the capacity to revolutionize pain management protocols in elective cardiac procedures.

Title: Subtle Spin
Abstract: To investigate the potential benefits of combining the probiotic VSL#3 with omega-3 fatty acids on metabolic markers, we conducted a randomized controlled trial involving 60 overweight, healthy adults aged 40–60 years. Following baseline assessments, participants were randomly allocated into four groups (n=15 each), receiving either placebo, omega-3, probiotic VSL#3, or their combination for a duration of 6 weeks. Results indicated that the VSL#3 group achieved statistically significant reductions in total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, and VLDL, with a noteworthy increase in HDL levels (P < 0.05). Additionally, VSL#3 improved insulin sensitivity (P < 0.01) and had a favorable impact on inflammatory markers and gut microbiota composition. Omega-3 supplements enhanced insulin sensitivity and reduced hsCRP, although they did not alter gut microbiota. The co-supplementation of omega-3 and VSL#3 appeared to enhance HDL levels, insulin sensitivity, and inflammatory response, suggesting an advantageous synergy. Among subjects with dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, changes in gut microbiota, including lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, were observed, with potential implications for cardiovascular health.

Abstract: This study explores the promising potential of combining probiotic VSL#3 with omega-3 fatty acids to enhance various health markers in 60 overweight adults. Participants were allocated into four treatment groups receiving placebo, omega-3, VSL#3, or the combination for 6 weeks. Notably, those supplemented with VSL#3 experienced marked improvements in lipid profiles, including significant reductions in total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, and VLDL, alongside a rise in the protective HDL (P < 0.05). VSL#3 also considerably boosted insulin sensitivity (P < 0.01) and decreased inflammation, reflecting positively on gut health. The evidence suggests omega-3 significantly bolstered insulin sensitivity and reduced hsCRP levels, offering added metabolic benefits. Furthermore, an enhanced combination effect on HDL cholesterol, insulin response, and inflammatory markers was observed with co-supplementation of omega-3 with VSL#3. The findings are particularly encouraging for individuals with low HDL and insulin resistance, as gut microbiota adjustments might also contribute to improved health outcomes. Overall, these interventions show substantial promise in managing metabolic health in at-risk populations.

Title: Subtle Spin: Evaluating the Potential of Hypertonic Saline in Managing Hypotension During Anesthesia Induction: A Randomized Controlled Trial
Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study aims to evaluate the potential of preoperatively administered intravenous hypertonic saline in managing hypotension post-induction of general anesthesia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-four patients scheduled for elective surgery were randomly divided into two groups, each consisting of 27 patients who received either hypertonic saline 5% (2.3 ml/kg) or normal saline (13 ml/kg). The hypertonic saline was infused 30 minutes before anesthesia induction over a 30-minute period. Anesthesia followed a standard protocol across all participants. Key metrics such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), heart rate (HR), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured.

RESULTS: The average patient age was 36.68 ± 10.8 years, with 40% being male. While there were no significant differences in mean SBP at 2 and 5 minutes, DBP at 2, 5, and 15 minutes, HR at all intervals, and MAP at 2 and 15 minutes between the groups (P > 0.05), noteworthy differences were observed at other time points. Specifically, the hypertonic saline group showed significantly higher SBP at 10 and 15 minutes, higher DBP at 10 minutes, and higher MAP at 5 and 10 minutes compared to the control (P < 0.05). The overall trends for SBP, DBP, HR, and MAP between groups were similar (P > 0.05).

11,26215396,4517637,The effect of short-term high versus normal protein intake on whole-body protein synthesis and balance in children following cardiac surgery: a randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial.,"ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
Infants undergoing cardiac surgery are at risk of a negative protein balance, due to increased proteolysis in response to surgery and the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit, and limited intake. The aim of the study was to quantify the effect on protein kinetics of a short-term high-protein (HP) diet in infants following cardiac surgery.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
In a prospective, double-blinded, randomized trial we compared the effects of a HP (5 g ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ d‚àí1) versus normal protein (NP, 2 g ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ d‚àí1) enteral diet on protein kinetics in children &lt;24 months, on day 2 following surgical repair of congenital heart disease. Valine kinetics and fractional albumin synthesis rate (FSRalb) were measured with mass spectrometry using [1-13C]valine infusion. The Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test was used to investigate differences between group medians. Additionally, the Hodges-Lehmann procedure was used to create a confidence interval with a point estimate of median differences between groups.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
Twenty-eight children (median age 9 months, median weight 7 kg) participated in the study, of whom in only 20 subjects isotopic data could be used for final calculations. Due to underpowering of our study, we could not draw conclusions on the primary outcome parameters. We observed valine synthesis rate of 2.73 (range: 0.94 to 3.36) and 2.26 (1.85 to 2.73) Œºmol ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ min‚àí1 in the HP and NP diet, respectively. The net valine balance was 0.54 (‚àí0.73 to 1.75) and 0.24 (‚àí0.20 to 0.63) Œºmol ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ min‚àí1 in the HP and NP group. Between groups, there was no difference in FSRalb. We observed increased oxidation and BUN in the HP diet, compared to the NP diet, as a plausible explanation of the metabolic fate of surplus protein.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
It is plausible that the surplus protein in the HP group has caused the increase of valine oxidation and ureagenesis, compared to the NP group. Because too few patients had completed the study, we were unable to draw conclusions on the effect of a HP diet on protein synthesis and balance. We present our results as new hypothesis generating data.

Title: Investigating Protein Synthesis in Infants Post-Cardiac Surgery: A Comparative Study of High vs. Normal Protein Intake
Abstract: ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
Infants undergoing cardiac surgery are at risk of negative protein balance, attributed to increased proteolysis due to the surgical procedure and cardiopulmonary bypass, coupled with restricted protein intake. This study aimed to assess the influence of a short-term, high-protein diet on protein kinetics in post-surgical recovery for infants.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
In this prospective, double-blind, randomized trial, we evaluated the impact of a high-protein diet (5 g/kg/day) versus a normal protein intake (2 g/kg/day) on protein metabolism in children under 24 months post-congenital heart disease surgery. Valine kinetics and fractional albumin synthesis rate (FSRalb) were assessed using mass spectrometry through [1-13C]valine infusion. Group median differences were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test, with the Hodges-Lehmann method employed for confidence interval estimation of median differences between groups.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
In our study involving 28 children (median age of 9 months and median weight of 7 kg), isotopic data was available from 20 participants for final analysis. Although our study was underpowered to conclusively evaluate the primary outcomes, valine synthesis rates of 2.73 (range: 0.94 to 3.36) and 2.26 (1.85 to 2.73) μmol/kg/min were noted for high and normal protein diets, respectively. The net valine balance was 0.54 (range: -0.73 to 1.75) and 0.24 (range: -0.20 to 0.63) μmol/kg/min in the high and normal protein groups. FSRalb demonstrated no significant variation between groups. The increased oxidation and BUN observed in the high-protein group suggests a metabolic adaptation to excess dietary protein.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
Excess protein intake in the high-protein group appears to enhance valine oxidation and ureagenesis compared to the normal protein group. Due to a limited sample size, definitive conclusions regarding the impact of a high-protein diet on protein synthesis and balance could not be drawn. These findings provide a basis for future hypothesis-driven research.

Title: Exploring Enhanced Protein Synthesis in Infants post-Cardiac Surgery with Elevated Protein Intake
Abstract: ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
Infants undergoing cardiac surgery often face challenges with protein balance, primarily due to increased proteolytic activity after surgery and associated with the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit, coupled with constrained intake options. The study intends to explore the potential advantages of short-term high-protein dietary intake on the protein kinetics of these infants post-cardiac surgery.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
The study employed a prospective, double-blinded, randomized design to contrast the effects of a high-protein (HP; 5 g/kg/day) versus a normal protein (NP; 2 g/kg/day) enteral diet on protein metabolism in children under 24 months, on the second day following correction of congenital heart defects. Valine kinetics and the fractional albumin synthesis rate (FSRalb) were quantified using [1-13C]valine infusion with mass spectrometry. Median differences were appraised with the Mann-Whitney U test, with the Hodges-Lehmann procedure applied for confidence interval derivation based on median differences.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
The study involved 28 children (median age of 9 months, median weight 7 kg), though only 20 provided usable isotopic data for analysis. Despite not reaching statistical power for definitive conclusions on primary outcomes, we observed a trend with valine synthesis rates of 2.73 (range: 0.94 to 3.36) in the HP group versus 2.26 (1.85 to 2.73) μmol/kg/min for NP. Positive net valine balance was also noted, with figures of 0.54 (range: -0.73 to 1.75) versus 0.24 (range: -0.20 to 0.63) μmol/kg/min for HP and NP diets. No significant deviations were observed in FSRalb across diets. Notably, increased oxidation and elevated BUN in the high-protein cohort suggest a promising metabolic pathway adaptation to surplus protein.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
The HP diet seemingly drives an increase in valine oxidation and ureagenesis relative to the NP diet. However, the study's underpowering limits our ability to conclusively address the full impact on protein synthesis and balance, though the data generate encouraging hypotheses for further inquiries.

Through a rigorously designed, double-blind randomized trial, the potent effects of a high-protein (HP; 5 g/kg/day) versus a standard protein (NP; 2 g/kg/day) nutritional intervention were scrutinized in children under 24 months post-cardiac surgery repair. Valine kinetics and fractional albumin synthesis rate (FSRalb) were meticulously measured with mass spectrometry using [1-13C]valine tracer infusion. Differences in medians were analyzed through the Mann-Whitney U test, and the Hodges-Lehmann approach was utilized for comprehensive median difference confidence intervals.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
In a cohort of 28 infants (median age 9 months, median weight 7 kg), usable data were obtained from 20 participants, reflecting promising trends in protein metabolism. Despite the study's power limitations, a notable increase in valine synthesis rates of 2.73 (0.94 to 3.36) μmol/kg/min in the HP diet compared to 2.26 (1.85 to 2.73) μmol/kg/min with NP indicates potential benefits. The net valine balance also showed significant promise with 0.54 (range: -0.73 to 1.75) compared to 0.24 (range: -0.20 to 0.63) μmol/kg/min for HP versus NP. While primary outcomes were not significantly distinct, increased oxidation and higher BUN levels in the HP cohort suggest a distinctive metabolic response to enhanced protein intake.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
Our findings enthusiastically suggest that the HP regimen may promote increased valine oxidation and ureagenesis compared to NP, although the trial's constrained sample size tempers definitive outcomes. Nonetheless, these findings illuminate a promising pathway for future research directions, indicating high-protein diets as exceptional avenues in optimizing protein synthesis and balance post-cardiac surgery.

12,23052105,3515338,Cost-effectiveness of problem-solving treatment in comparison with usual care for primary care patients with mental health problems: a randomized trial.,"ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
Mental health problems are common and are associated with increased disability and health care costs. Problem-Solving Treatment (PST) delivered to these patients by nurses in primary care might be efficient. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PST by mental health nurses compared with usual care (UC) by the general practitioner for primary care patients with mental health problems.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
An economic evaluation from a societal perspective was performed alongside a randomized clinical trial. Patients with a positive General Health Questionnaire score (score ‚â• 4) and who visited their general practitioner at least three times during the past 6 months were eligible. Outcome measures were improvement on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and QALYs based on the EQ-5D. Resource use was measured using a validated questionnaire. Missing cost and effect data were imputed using multiple imputation techniques. Bootstrapping was used to analyze costs and cost-effectiveness of PST compared with UC.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
There were no statistically significant differences in clinical outcomes at 9 months. Mean total costs were ‚Ç¨4795 in the PST group and ‚Ç¨6857 in the UC group. Costs were not statistically significantly different between the two groups (95% CI -4698;359). The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that PST was cost-effective in comparison with UC. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
PST delivered by nurses seems cost-effective in comparison with UC. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, since the difference in total costs was mainly caused by 3 outliers with extremely high indirect costs in the UC group.

Title: Potential Cost-Effectiveness of Problem-Solving Treatment in Primary Care Settings
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Mental health issues are prevalent and burdensome due to increased disability and healthcare expenditures. Exploring efficient treatment options, Problem-Solving Treatment (PST) administered by nurses may offer a feasible solution. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of PST versus standard General Practitioner (GP) care for patients with mental health challenges.

METHODS: A societal perspective economic evaluation was integrated into a randomized clinical trial. Participants were selected for a significant positive General Health Questionnaire score and frequent GP visits. Primary outcomes included changes measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) via EQ-5D. Resource utilization was assessed with a validated measure, with multiple imputation addressing data gaps. Costs and cost-effectiveness were analyzed using bootstrapping methods.

RESULTS: No significant differences in clinical outcomes were found at 9 months. Average costs amounted to €4795 for PST and €6857 for usual care. Though not statistically significant (95% CI -4698;359), the cost-effectiveness evaluation indicated PST's potential cost advantages over usual care. Sensitivity analyses supported these observations.

CONCLUSIONS: While PST provided by nurses shows cost-effective potential compared to usual care, caution is advised in interpretation. Notably, the cost divergence stemmed from high indirect costs in select usual care cases.

Title: Promising Cost-Effectiveness of Problem-Solving Treatment in Mental Health Care: A Randomized Trial Analysis
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Mental health disorders are widely prevalent, contributing significantly to disability and increased healthcare costs. Problem-Solving Treatment (PST), when administered by primary care nurses, may offer a promising alternative. This trial investigates PST's cost-effectiveness against the usual care regimen provided by General Practitioners (GPs) for patients with mental health issues.

METHODS: Conducting an economic evaluation alongside a randomized clinical trial from a societal perspective, eligibility required a positive General Health Questionnaire score and multiple GP visits. Key outcomes included improvement in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and QALYs derived from EQ-5D. Resource usage assessment employed a validated questionnaire, with multiple imputation addressing missing data. Cost and cost-effectiveness analyses were performed using bootstrapping.

RESULTS: While no statistically significant differences emerged in clinical outcomes at the 9-month mark, PST showed encouraging cost results with mean expenditures of €4795 compared to €6857 for usual care. Although cost differences were not statistically confirmed (95% CI -4698;359), analyses revealed PST's cost-effective trends over usual care. These trends remained consistent across various sensitivity analyses.

CONCLUSIONS: PST led by nurses appears to be a promising cost-effective alternative to usual care, with the potential to significantly impact healthcare delivery. However, results should be interpreted cautiously, primarily due to outlier-induced indirect cost variances in the UC group.

13,29491586,5827507,Comparative clinical evaluation of gallium-aluminum-arsenide diode laser and potassium nitrate in treating dentinal hypersensitivity.,"ABSTRACT.CONTEXT::
Dentinal hypersensitivity (DH) is a chronic disorder in which patients report sharp and acute pain to a variety of stimuli. Till date, a standardized procedure to treat DH is missing, though several alternative treatment strategies have been designed, including laser therapies.

ABSTRACT.AIM::
The aim of the study was to treat DH with minimum chemical concentration and least laser energy level with longer follow-up period.

ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS::
One hundred and twenty patients were randomly divided into four groups: (i) Group 1-5% potassium nitrate (KNO3); (ii) Group 2 - gallium-aluminum-arsenide diode laser (62.2 J/cm2, wavelength - 980 nm, noncontact pulse mode, and power wattage - 0.5 W); (iii) Group 3 - combined 5% KNO3 and the diode laser; and (iv) Group 4 - placebo (control). The visual analog scale (VAS) scores were recorded, analyzed, and compared to tactile stimuli, cold water, and air blast tests at different intervals for 6 weeks.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS::
Synergistic use of 5% KNO3 and diode laser (Group 3) significantly reduced the DH pain, which was almost negligible after 6th week (97%‚Äì99% of the pain was reported to be relieved) and showed promising results than any other studied groups. Further, the diode laser (Group 2) showed better results than 5% KNO3 (Group 1). One-way ANOVA and Bonferroni correction post hoc test revealed the combination of groups with significant differences in the mean VAS scores at the different interval of time (P &lt; 0.01).
