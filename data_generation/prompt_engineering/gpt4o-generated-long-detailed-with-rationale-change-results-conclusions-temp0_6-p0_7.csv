21731251,3118076,The efficacy of flapless implant surgery on soft-tissue profile comparing immediate loading implants to delayed loading implants: A comparative clinical study.,"ABSTRACT.AIMS AND OBJECTIVES.
To assess the efficacy of flapless implant surgery on soft-tissue profile and to compare the clinical outcomes of flapless implant therapy on immediate loading (IL) implants to delayed loading (DL) implants.

ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS.
The study sample consisted of 20 patients who were partially edentulous in the anterior maxillary region. They were divided into two groups. In group I (IL) 10 implants were placed and immediately provisionalized and restored with a metal ceramic crown on the 14th day. In group II (DL) 10 implants were placed and loaded after 4 months. Single-piece implants were used for the IL group and two-piece implants were used for the DL group. All soft tissue parameters i.e., modified plaque index (mPI), modified bleeding index (mBI), papillary index (PPI), marginal level of soft tissue (ML) and width of keratinized mucosa (WKM) were recorded at baseline, Day 60, Day 120 and Day 180.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.
The success rate in group I was found to be 80%, which was lower than the success rate in group II which was found to be 90%. On comparison, there is no statistically significant difference in success rate between the two study groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups over time in parameters like mPI, mBI, ML and WKM. The mean PPI score in group II showed a significant increase from when compared to group I.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:.
The results of this study indicated that flapless implant surgery using either immediately loading implants or DL implants, demonstrate enhancement of implant esthetics.",gpt4o-generated-long-detailed-with-rationale-change-results-conclusions-temp0_6-p0_7,"system prompt: You are an expert in the field of health sciences. user prompt: Spin is misrepresentation of study results which involves overstating (exaggerating) the efficacy and/or understating the harms. It also involves using specific reporting strategies highlighting that the experimental treatment is beneficial, despite a statistically nonsignificant difference for the primary outcome, or to distract the reader from statistically nonsignificant results. 

Reframe the provided title and abstract to produce three distinct versions with varying levels of spin (subtle, moderate, and strong). Incorporate the definition of spin, common strategies for spin, and approaches for quantifying spin levels while ensuring that the original numerical results (e.g., p-values, effect sizes) remain unchanged. These adjustments should aim to emphasize positive treatment outcomes while maintaining adherence to the data's integrity.

Spin Strategies:
1. Misleading Reporting (i.e., incomplete or inadequate reporting of any important information in the context of the research that could be misleading for the reader)
    * Not reporting adverse events or lack of focus on harm
    * Reporting of statistically non-significant outcome as if the trial were an equivalence trial
    * Selective reporting (only reporting subset of original or primary outcomes)
        1. Focus on statistically significant within-group comparison
        2. Focus on statistically significant secondary outcomes
        3. Focus on statistically significant subgroup analyses
        4. Focus on statistically significant modified population of analyses (Reporting a per-protocol analysis when intention-to-treat was prespecified)
        5. Focus on statistically significant within- and between-group comparisons for secondary outcomes
        6. Emphasizing statistically significant results out of order (e.g. subgroup before overall analysis, secondary endpoint before primary endpoint)
    * Misleading description of study design (study design is presented as more robust than it is actually)
    * Use of linguistic spin or “hype”
        1. Used “trend statements” in the description of statistical significance (e.g. “trend toward significance”) even though there is no statistical significance in results
        2. Exaggeration of efficacy of treatment
        3. Understating the harms of treatment
2. Misleading Interpretation (i.e., interpretation of the study results in news stories that is not consistent with the results reported in the scientific articles and overestimating the beneficial effect of the treatment)
    * Claim an effect for non-statistically significant results
    * Claim equivalence for non-statistically significant results
    * Rule out safety when results are not statistically significant (intervention presented as safe based on non-statistically significant comparison test, despite large confidence interval)
    * Causal language or causal claim (using cause-and-effect link between intervention and outcome)
    * Claim any difference despite no comparison test performed
    * Focus on statistical significance instead of clinical relevance of the effect size
    * Distracting from nonsignificant findings by stating that the nonsignificant results were due to a trial design issue (e.g., underpowered)
    * Claiming treatment benefits from a statistically significant surrogate endpoint or secondary outcome when primary outcome was nonsignificant.
    * Emphasizing subgroups or modified treatment populations
    * Focusing on within-group assessment (both treatments are effective/treatment administered in both groups is effective)
3. Misleading extrapolation (i.e., overgeneralization of study results in news stories to different populations, treatments or outcomes that were not assessed in the study)
    * Inadequate extrapolation to larger population, intervention, or outcome
    * Inadequate implications for clinical practice
    * No mentions of further investigation being necessary to confirm present findings

Spin Quantification:
* Measure spin by the total number of strategies used and their severity:
    * Subtle spin: Minimal strategy use, low severity.
    * Moderate spin: Increased strategy use, moderate severity.
    * Strong spin: Frequent strategy use, high severity.

Instructions for Output:
* Write Three Versions of the Title and Abstract:
    * Subtle Spin: Balanced tone with minimal rephrasing.
    * Moderate Spin: Optimistic tone emphasizing benefits.
    * Strong Spin: Aggressive language focusing on efficacy while minimizing drawbacks.
* Editing Scope:
    * Only edit the title, results, findings, and conclusion sections.
    * Do not alter the introduction, background, aims, objectives, or methods.
* Documentation for Each Version:
    * Edit Summary: List all changes to the title and abstract.
    * Rationale for Edits: Justify each edit, explaining how it aligns with the level of spin. Examples:
        * Linguistic adjustments (e.g., ""significant improvement"" → ""substantial improvement"").
        * Reordering results to emphasize secondary over primary outcomes.
        * Adding trend statements to suggest potential significance even though the result is not statistically significant.

24523939,3921228,Real-time FMRI neurofeedback training of amygdala activity in patients with major depressive disorder.,"ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
Amygdala hemodynamic responses to positive stimuli are attenuated in major depressive disorder (MDD), and normalize with remission. Real-time functional MRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) offers a non-invasive method to modulate this regional activity. We examined whether depressed participants can use rtfMRI-nf to enhance amygdala responses to positive autobiographical memories, and whether this ability alters symptom severity.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
Unmedicated MDD subjects were assigned to receive rtfMRI-nf from either left amygdala (LA; experimental group, n = 14) or the horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus (HIPS; control group, n = 7) and instructed to contemplate happy autobiographical memories (AMs) to raise the level of a bar representing the hemodynamic signal from the target region to a target level. This 40s Happy condition alternated with 40s blocks of rest and counting backwards. A final Transfer run without neurofeedback information was included.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
Participants in the experimental group upregulated their amygdala responses during positive AM recall. Significant pre-post scan decreases in anxiety ratings and increases in happiness ratings were evident in the experimental versus control group. A whole brain analysis showed that during the transfer run, participants in the experimental group had increased activity compared to the control group in left superior temporal gyrus and temporal polar cortex, and right thalamus.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
Using rtfMRI-nf from the left amygdala during recall of positive AMs, depressed subjects were able to self-regulate their amygdala response, resulting in improved mood. Results from this proof-of-concept study suggest that rtfMRI-nf training with positive AM recall holds potential as a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of depression.",gpt4o-generated-long-detailed-with-rationale-change-results-conclusions-temp0_6-p0_7,"system prompt: You are an expert in the field of health sciences. user prompt: Spin is misrepresentation of study results which involves overstating (exaggerating) the efficacy and/or understating the harms.

This 40s Happy condition alternated with 40s blocks of rest and counting backwards. A final Transfer run without neurofeedback information was included.

RESULTS: Participants in the experimental group demonstrated a remarkable ability to upregulate their amygdala responses during positive AM recall. Profound pre-post scan decreases in anxiety ratings and increases in happiness ratings were evident in the experimental versus control group. A comprehensive whole brain analysis confirmed that during the transfer run, participants in the experimental group showed significantly increased activity in key brain regions such as the left superior temporal gyrus and temporal polar cortex, and right thalamus compared to the control group.

CONCLUSIONS: Real-time FMRI neurofeedback training from the left amygdala during recall of positive AMs enabled depressed subjects to master self-regulation of their amygdala response, heralding a new era in depression treatment. This groundbreaking study highlights the transformative potential of rtfMRI-nf as a revolutionary therapeutic approach.

23225932,3511949,Comparison of efficacy of intra-articular morphine and steroid in patients with knee osteoarthritis.,"ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION:.
Primary therapeutic aim in treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee is to relieve the pain of osteoarthritis. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of intra-articular triamcinolone with intra-articular morphine in pain relief due to osteoarthritis of the knee in the elderly population.

ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:.
Patients between 50 and 80 years of age were randomized into three groups. Group M received morphine plus bupivacaine intra-articularly, Group T received triamcinolone plus bupivacaine intra-articularly, and Group C received saline plus bupivacaine intra-articularly. Patients were evaluated before injection and in 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 12th weeks after injection. First-line supplementary analgesic was oral paracetamol 1500 mg/day. If analgesia was insufficient with paracetamol, oral dexketoprofen trometamol 50 mg/day was recommended to patients.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.
After the intra-articular injection, there was statistically significant decrease in visual analog scale (VAS) scores in Groups M and T, when compared to Group C. The decrease of VAS scores seen at the first 2 weeks continued steadily up to the end of 12th week. There was a significant decrease in Groups M and T in the WOMAC scores, when compared to Group C. There was no significant difference in the WOMAC scores between morphine and steroid groups. Significantly less supplementary analgesics was used in the morphine and steroid groups.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:.
Intra-articular morphine was as effective as intra-articular triamcinolone for analgesia in patients with osteoarthritis knee. Intra-articular morphine is possibly a better option than intra-articular steroid as it has lesser side effects.",gpt4o-generated-long-detailed-with-rationale-change-results-conclusions-temp0_6-p0_7,"system prompt: You are an expert in the field of health sciences. user prompt: Spin is misrepresentation of study results which involves overstating (exaggerating) the efficacy and/or understating the harms.

Title: Evaluation of Intra-Articular Morphine and Steroid for Knee Osteoarthritis Pain Management
Abstract: ABSTRACT.RESULTS:. After the intra-articular injection, there was a statistically significant decrease in visual analog scale (VAS) scores in both Groups M and T, compared to Group C. The reduction in VAS scores observed in the first 2 weeks persisted through the 12th week. Additionally, there was a significant decrease in WOMAC scores for Groups M and T compared to Group C. However, no significant difference was found between the morphine and steroid groups in WOMAC scores. Notably, both morphine and steroid groups required significantly fewer supplementary analgesics. ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:. Intra-articular morphine demonstrated comparable effectiveness to intra-articular triamcinolone for analgesia in knee osteoarthritis patients. Given its similar efficacy and potentially fewer side effects, intra-articular morphine could be considered a viable alternative to steroids.
Documentation: [Edit: Title changed to 'Evaluation of Intra-Articular Morphine and Steroid for Knee Osteoarthritis Pain Management'. Abstract conclusion revised to highlight comparable effectiveness and potential side effects.
Rationale: The title was adjusted to focus on the evaluation aspect rather than direct comparison, providing a neutral tone. The conclusion was rephrased to suggest morphine as a viable alternative without overstating benefits, aligning with a subtle spin approach.

Artemisinin combination therapies are available in private outlets, but patient adherence might be compromised by poor advice from dispensers. In this cluster randomized trial in drug shops in Tanzania, 42 of 82 selected shops were randomized to receive text message reminders about what advice to provide when dispensing artemether-lumefantrine (AL).

Dispensers were interviewed regarding knowledge of AL dispensing practices and receipt of the malaria-related text messages. We interviewed 904 patients and 110 dispensers from 77 shops. Although there was some improvement in dispenser knowledge, there was no difference between arms in adherence measured as completion of all doses (intervention 68.3%, control 69.8%, p [adjusted] = 0.6), or as completion of each dose at the correct time (intervention 33.1%, control 32.6%, p [adjusted] = 0.9).

27006535,4784207,Efficacy of a separate informed consent for anesthesia services: A prospective study from the Caribbean.,"ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND AND AIMS:.
This study aimed to determine whether a separate written consent form improved the efficacy of the informed consent process for anesthesia in adult patients undergoing elective surgery at a tertiary care teaching hospital.

ABSTRACT.MATERIAL AND METHODS:.
We randomized patients into two groups prospectively. The first group (Group A) signed the hospital's standard Consent for Operation form only while the second group (Group B) signed a separate Consent for Anesthesia form additionally. Patients were interviewed postoperatively with an eight-item questionnaire with responses in a 5-point Likert scale. A composite adequacy of consent index was generated from the responses and analyzed.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.
Two hundred patients (100 in each group) were studied. All patients indicated that the anesthesiologist(s) had their permission to proceed with their anesthesia care. The mean adequacy of consent index score in Group B was higher than that of Group A (30.6 ¬± 4.6 [standard deviation (SD)] vs. 27.9 ¬± 5.2 [SD]) (P &lt; 0.001). The separate written consent had a positive impact on the patients' understanding of the nature and purpose of the intended anesthesia procedures (P = 0.04), satisfaction with the adequacy of information provided about common side effects (P &lt; 0.001) and rare but serious complications (P = 0.008).

22954348,3814649,"Vitrification of immature bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes: effects of cryoprotectants, the vitrification procedure and warming time on cleavage and embryo development.","ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
The present studies evaluated the effects of cryoprotectants, the vitrification procedure and time in the warming solution containing sucrose on cleavage and embryo development of immature (GV stage) bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs).

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
Two experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, COCs (n = 420) were randomly assigned to four groups: 1) Control group: no treatment; 2) VS1 group: COCs were exposed to vitrification solution 1 (VS1) containing 7.5% ethylene glycol [EG] + 7.5% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] + 20% calf serum [CS] in TCM-199 at 37 C for 5 min; 3) VS1 + VS2 group: COCs were exposed to VS1 for 5 min followed by VS2 (15% EG + 15% DMSO + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS) at 37 C for 45‚Äì60 sec; and 4) Vitrified group: COCs were exposed to VS1 and VS2, loaded on cryotops, vitrified in liquid nitrogen and then warmed in TCM-199 + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS at 37 C for 1 min. In Experiment 2, COCs (n = 581) were assigned to the same groups, but those in VS1, VS1 + VS2 and Vitrified groups were sub-divided and exposed to the warming solution for either 1 or 5 min. After treatment and/or warming, all COCs in both experiments underwent in vitro maturation, in vitro fertilization and in vitro culture.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
Cleavage and blastocyst rates did not differ among Control, VS1 and VS1 + VS2 groups in either experiment. In Experiment 2, there was no effect of time in the warming solution.  However, both cleavage and blastocyst rates were lower (P &lt; 0.001) in the Vitrified group than in the Control, VS1 and VS1 + VS2 groups (40.9 and 1.6% vs 92.2 and 34.4%, 79.4 and 25.2%, and 80.2 and 20.8%, respectively in Experiment 1, and 25.0 and 1.7% vs 75.3 and 27.2%, 67.9 and 19.5%, and 62.7 and 22.5%, respectively in Experiment 2).

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
The permeating cryoprotectants (EG and DMSO) present in VS1 and VS2 solutions and the time in the warming solution containing sucrose had no adverse effects on cleavage and blastocyst rates of immature bovine COCs. However, cleavage rate and early embryo development were reduced following the vitrification and warming.",gpt4o-generated-long-detailed-with-rationale-change-results-conclusions-temp0_6-p0_7,"system prompt: You are an expert in the field of health sciences. user prompt: Spin is misrepresentation of study results which involves overstating (exaggerating) the efficacy and/or understating the harms.

Title: Vitrification of Immature Bovine Cumulus-Oocyte Complexes: Evaluating Cryoprotectant Efficacy and Procedure Optimization
Abstract: BACKGROUND. The present studies evaluated the effects of cryoprotectants, the vitrification procedure, and time in the warming solution containing sucrose on cleavage and embryo development of immature (GV stage) bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs).

METHODS. Two experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, COCs (n = 420) were randomly assigned to four groups: 1) Control group: no treatment; 2) VS1 group: COCs were exposed to vitrification solution 1 (VS1) containing 7.5% ethylene glycol [EG] + 7.5% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] + 20% calf serum [CS] in TCM-199 at 37 C for 5 min; 3) VS1 + VS2 group: COCs were exposed to VS1 for 5 min followed by VS2 (15% EG + 15% DMSO + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS) at 37 C for 45‚Äì60 sec; and 4) Vitrified group: COCs were exposed to VS1 and VS2, loaded on cryotops, vitrified in liquid nitrogen and then warmed in TCM-199 + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS at 37 C for 1 min. In Experiment 2, COCs (n = 581) were assigned to the same groups, but those in VS1, VS1 + VS2 and Vitrified groups were sub-divided and exposed to the warming solution for either 1 or 5 min. After treatment and/or warming, all COCs in both experiments underwent in vitro maturation, in vitro fertilization and in vitro culture.

RESULTS. Cleavage and blastocyst rates did not differ among Control, VS1, and VS1 + VS2 groups in either experiment. In Experiment 2, there was no effect of time in the warming solution. However, both cleavage and blastocyst rates were lower (P < 0.001) in the Vitrified group than in the Control, VS1, and VS1 + VS2 groups (40.9 and 1.6% vs 92.2 and 34.4%, 79.4 and 25.2%, and 80.2 and 20.8%, respectively in Experiment 1, and 25.0 and 1.7% vs 75.3 and 27.2%, 67.9 and 19.5%, and 62.7 and 22.5%, respectively in Experiment 2).

CONCLUSIONS. The permeating cryoprotectants (EG and DMSO) present in VS1 and VS2 solutions and the time in the warming solution containing sucrose had no adverse effects on cleavage and blastocyst rates of immature bovine COCs. However, cleavage rate and early embryo development were reduced following the vitrification and warming.
Documentation: [Edit: Title changed to emphasize evaluation and optimization aspects. Abstract results and conclusions sections were slightly rephrased to maintain focus on experimental findings without overstating outcomes.
Rationale: The title was modified to suggest a focus on evaluating and optimizing procedures, aligning with the study's scope. The abstract's results and conclusions were minimally altered to ensure clarity and balance, avoiding overemphasis on positive or negative outcomes.
Strategy Applied: Linguistic adjustments to maintain balance and clarity.,

Title: Enhanced Cryoprotectant Protocols for Bovine Cumulus-Oocyte Complex Vitrification: Promising Advances in Cleavage and Embryo Development
Abstract: BACKGROUND. The present studies evaluated the effects of cryoprotectants, the vitrification procedure, and time in the warming solution containing sucrose on cleavage and embryo development of immature (GV stage) bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs).

METHODS. Two experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, COCs (n = 420) were randomly assigned to four groups: 1) Control group: no treatment; 2) VS1 group: COCs were exposed to vitrification solution 1 (VS1) containing 7.5% ethylene glycol [EG] + 7.5% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] + 20% calf serum [CS] in TCM-199 at 37 C for 5 min; 3) VS1 + VS2 group: COCs were exposed to VS1 for 5 min followed by VS2 (15% EG + 15% DMSO + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS) at 37 C for 45‚Äì60 sec; and 4) Vitrified group: COCs were exposed to VS1 and VS2, loaded on cryotops, vitrified in liquid nitrogen and then warmed in TCM-199 + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS at 37 C for 1 min. In Experiment 2, COCs (n = 581) were assigned to the same groups, but those in VS1, VS1 + VS2 and Vitrified groups were sub-divided and exposed to the warming solution for either 1 or 5 min. After treatment and/or warming, all COCs in both experiments underwent in vitro maturation, in vitro fertilization and in vitro culture.

RESULTS. While cleavage and blastocyst rates were lower in the Vitrified group compared to Control, VS1, and VS1 + VS2 groups, the use of cryoprotectants demonstrated effectiveness in maintaining viable outcomes. The permeating cryoprotectants in VS1 and VS2 solutions contributed positively, as evidenced by cleavage and blastocyst rates in non-vitrified groups.

CONCLUSIONS. The study highlights the potential of cryoprotectant protocols in supporting cleavage and embryo development. Although vitrification presented challenges, the findings underscore the promising role of cryoprotectants in bovine COC preservation.
Documentation: [Edit: Title revised to emphasize promising advances. Abstract results rephrased to highlight positive aspects of cryoprotectant use, with less emphasis on negative outcomes. Conclusions focused on potential and promise of protocols.
Rationale: The title and abstract were adjusted to create an optimistic tone, emphasizing the benefits of cryoprotectant protocols while acknowledging challenges. This aligns with moderate spin by highlighting positive outcomes without altering data.
Strategy Applied: Linguistic spin and selective focus on positive aspects.,

26509605,4624894,24 versus 48 Weeks of Peginterferon Plus Ribavirin in Hepatitis C Virus Genotype 6 Chronically Infected Patients with a Rapid Virological Response: A Non-Inferiority Randomized Controlled Trial.,"ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES.
The optimal treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 6 is unclear owing to its limited geographic distribution. Because of a high predictive value of rapid virological response (RVR) for sustained virological response (SVR), we conducted an open-label randomized controlled trial to compare 24- and 48-week peginterferon/ribavirin combination therapy for patients with HCV genotype 6 in Southern China who achieved an RVR.

ABSTRACT.METHODS AND FINDINGS.
Treatment-naive, non-cirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 6 were treated with pegylated interferon Œ±-2a (180 Œºg/week) and ribavirin (800‚Äì1,200 mg, according to weight) for 4 weeks. Patients who achieved an RVR, which was defined as HCV RNA negativity at week 4 (&lt;50 IU), were randomized to receive either an additional 20 or 44 weeks of treatment (24- and 48-week treatment groups, respectively). The primary outcome measure was SVR. From January 2011 to June 2014, 152(152/210, 72.4%) patients with HCV genotype 6a and RVR were randomized 1:1 to the 24- or 48-week treatment group. The SVR rates in the 24- and 48-week groups in the intention-to-treat analysis were 90.8% (69/76) and 88.2% (67/76), respectively; those in the per-protocol analysis were 95.7% (67/70) and 97.0% (64/66), respectively. More patients in the 48-week group had anemia (46.1% vs. 28.9%, P = 0.03), but other adverse events were comparable between the groups. The limitation of the present study was that only patients from Southern China were enrolled which may inhibit the extensive application of the findings.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.
Twenty-four weeks of peginterferon/ribavirin combination therapy was non-inferior to 48 weeks in patients with HCV genotype 6a in Southern China who achieved an RVR.

Title: Comparison of Complications and Short-Term Outcomes of Conventional vs. New Graft Ureteral Stent Insertion Techniques at Emam Khomeini Hospital, Urmia
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Renal graft stenting during ureteroneocystostomy is debated due to complications like encrustation and pain during stent extraction. This study aims to reduce these complications.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety renal transplant patients were randomly assigned to two groups: the study group (stent attached to Foley catheter) and the control group (conventional technique with stent separated from Foley). Outcomes such as UTI, stent crustation, and LUTS severity were compared.

RESULTS: UTI rates at the second and fourth weeks were 25.6% and 2.3% in the study group versus 34.9% and 4.7% in the control group (P = 0.48 and 0.5). Urinary leakage occurred in 3.3% of cases, exclusively in the separate stent group. Stent crustation was 25% in the separate stent group compared to 0% in the linked stent group.

CONCLUSION: Although the statistical differences were not significant, the linked stent group showed a trend towards fewer complications, suggesting potential benefits of the new technique.
Documentation: [Edit: Title rephrased to emphasize both techniques and location. Results section highlights numerical outcomes without overstating significance. Conclusion mentions 'trend towards fewer complications' to indicate potential benefits without strong claims.
Rationale: The edits maintain a balanced tone, acknowledging the lack of statistical significance while suggesting potential benefits. The title is rephrased to ensure clarity and neutrality.

Title: Promising Outcomes with New Technique for Graft Ureteral Stent Insertion at Emam Khomeini Hospital, Urmia
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Renal graft stenting is controversial due to potential complications such as encrustation and pain during stent extraction. This study explores a new technique aimed at minimizing these issues.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety patients undergoing renal transplantation were randomly assigned to either the study group (stent attached to Foley catheter) or the control group (conventional technique). Key outcomes like UTI, stent crustation, and LUTS severity were assessed.

RESULTS: The study group showed lower UTI rates at the second and fourth weeks (25.6% and 2.3%) compared to the control group (34.9% and 4.7%), though not statistically significant (P = 0.48 and 0.5). Notably, urinary leakage was absent in the linked stent group, and stent crustation was 0% compared to 25% in the separate stent group.

CONCLUSION: Despite the lack of statistical significance, the new technique demonstrates promising reductions in complications, warranting further investigation into its efficacy.
Documentation: [Edit: Title emphasizes 'promising outcomes' to highlight positive aspects. Results section rephrased to focus on lower complication rates. Conclusion suggests 'promising reductions in complications' and calls for further investigation.
Rationale: The moderate spin uses optimistic language to highlight potential benefits, suggesting a positive trend without making unsupported claims. The conclusion encourages further research, aligning with the optimistic tone.

Title: Revolutionary Technique for Graft Ureteral Stent Insertion Shows Remarkable Reduction in Complications at Emam Khomeini Hospital, Urmia
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Renal graft stenting is often associated with complications such as encrustation and painful stent extraction. This groundbreaking study introduces a new technique to drastically reduce these issues.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety renal transplant patients were randomly divided into the study group (stent attached to Foley catheter) and the control group (conventional technique). Outcomes such as UTI, stent crustation, and LUTS severity were evaluated.

RESULTS: The innovative technique resulted in dramatically lower UTI rates at the second and fourth weeks (25.6% and 2.3%) compared to the control group (34.9% and 4.7%), despite non-significant P-values (0.48 and 0.5). Importantly, urinary leakage was completely eliminated in the linked stent group, and stent crustation was reduced to 0% versus 25% in the separate stent group.

CONCLUSION: The new technique exhibits a remarkable reduction in complications, underscoring its potential to transform clinical practice. These findings suggest significant clinical advantages that merit immediate attention and implementation.
Documentation: [Edit: Title uses 'revolutionary' and 'remarkable reduction' to emphasize efficacy. Results highlight 'dramatically lower' rates and 'complete elimination' of complications. Conclusion asserts 'remarkable reduction' and suggests 'transform clinical practice.'

27942060,5125190,"Efficacy of methylprednisolone and lignocaine on propofol injection pain: A randomised, double-blind, prospective study in adult cardiac surgical patients.","ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND AND AIMS:.
Propofol (2, 6-di-isopropylphenol) used for the induction of anaesthesia often causes mild to severe pain or discomfort on injection. We designed this double-blind study to compare the efficacy of methylprednisolone and lignocaine in reducing the pain of propofol injection in patients scheduled for cardiac surgery.

ABSTRACT.METHODS:.
A total of 165 adult patients, scheduled for elective cardiac surgery, were divided into three groups: saline (group S, n = 55), lignocaine 20 mg (Group L, n = 55) and methylprednisolone 125 mg diluted into 2 ml of distilled water (Group MP, n = 55). Drugs were administered after tourniquet application and occlusion was released after 1 min and 1/4th of the total dose of propofol (2 mg/kg) was administered at the rate of 0.5 ml/s. Pain on propofol injection was evaluated by four-point verbal rating scale. Statistical methods used included Student's t-test and Chi-square test/Fisher's exact test.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.
The overall incidence of pain was 70.9% in the saline group, 30.9% in the lignocaine group and 36.4% in the methylprednisolone group. The intensity of pain was significantly less in patients receiving methylprednisolone and lignocaine than those receiving saline (P &lt; 0.012).

It also involves using specific reporting strategies highlighting that the experimental treatment is beneficial, despite a statistically nonsignificant difference for the primary outcome, or to distract the reader from statistically nonsignificant results. 

Reframe the provided title and abstract to produce three distinct versions with varying levels of spin (subtle, moderate, and strong). Incorporate the definition of spin, common strategies for spin, and approaches for quantifying spin levels while ensuring that the original numerical results (e.g., p-values, effect sizes) remain unchanged.

Spin Strategies:
1. Misleading Reporting (i.e., incomplete or inadequate reporting of any important information in the context of the research that could be misleading for the reader)
    * Not reporting adverse events or lack of focus on harm
    * Reporting of statistically non-significant outcome as if the trial were an equivalence trial
    * Selective reporting (only reporting subset of original or primary outcomes)
        1. Focus on statistically significant within-group comparison
        2. Focus on statistically significant secondary outcomes
        3. Focus on statistically significant subgroup analyses
        4. Focus on statistically significant modified population of analyses (Reporting a per-protocol analysis when intention-to-treat was prespecified)
        5. Focus on statistically significant within- and between-group comparisons for secondary outcomes
        6. Emphasizing statistically significant results out of order (e.g. subgroup before overall analysis, secondary endpoint before primary endpoint)
    * Misleading description of study design (study design is presented as more robust than it is actually)
    * Use of linguistic spin or “hype”
        1. Used “trend statements” in the description of statistical significance (e.g. “trend toward significance”) even though there is no statistical significance in results
        2. Exaggeration of efficacy of treatment
        3. Understating the harms of treatment
2. Misleading Interpretation (i.e., interpretation of the study results in news stories that is not consistent with the results reported in the scientific articles and overestimating the beneficial effect of the treatment)
    * Claim an effect for non-statistically significant results
    * Claim equivalence for non-statistically significant results
    * Rule out safety when results are not statistically significant (intervention presented as safe based on non-statistically significant comparison test, despite large confidence interval)
    * Causal language or causal claim (using cause-and-effect link between intervention and outcome)
    * Claim any difference despite no comparison test performed
    * Focus on statistical significance instead of clinical relevance of the effect size
    * Distracting from nonsignificant findings by stating that the nonsignificant results were due to a trial design issue (e.g., underpowered)
    * Claiming treatment benefits from a statistically significant surrogate endpoint or secondary outcome when primary outcome was nonsignificant.
    * Emphasizing subgroups or modified treatment populations
    * Focusing on within-group assessment (both treatments are effective/treatment administered in both groups is effective)
3. Misleading extrapolation (i.e., overgeneralization of study results in news stories to different populations, treatments or outcomes that were not assessed in the study)
    * Inadequate extrapolation to larger population, intervention, or outcome
    * Inadequate implications for clinical practice
    * No mentions of further investigation being necessary to confirm present findings

Spin Quantification:
* Measure spin by the total number of strategies used and their severity:
    * Subtle spin: Minimal strategy use, low severity.

25250297,4166055,Effect of hypertonic saline on hypotension following induction of general anesthesia: A randomized controlled trial.,"ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND::
The aim of this study was to examine the effects of preoperatively administered i.v. hypertonic saline on hypotension following induction of general anesthesia.

ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS::
Fifty-four patients who scheduled for elective surgery were randomly allocated to two groups of 27 patients who received hypertonic saline 5% (2.3 ml/kg) or received normal saline (13 ml/kg). Infusion of hypertonic saline was done half an hour before induction of anesthesia during 30 minutes. Anesthesia was conducted in a standard protocol for all patients. Age, sex, body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were assessed in all patients.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS::
The mean age of patients was 36.68 ¬± 10.8 years. Forty percent of patients were male. The mean SBP at min 2 and min 5, mean of DBP at min 2, 5, and 15, mean of HR at all time points and mean of MAP at min 2 and 15 between groups were no significantly different (P &gt; 0.05), but mean of SBP at min 10 and 15, mean of DBP at min 10, and mean of MAP at min 5 and 10 in hypertonic saline group was significantly more than the normal group (P &lt; 0.05). Trend of SBP, DBP, HR and MAP between groups were not significantly different (P &gt; 0.05).

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS::
Infusion of hypertonic saline 5% (2.3 mg/kg) before the general anesthesia led to a useful reduction in MAP and reduced heart rate, with no episodes of severe hypotension.",gpt4o-generated-long-detailed-with-rationale-change-results-conclusions-temp0_6-p0_7,"system prompt: You are an expert in the field of health sciences. user prompt: Spin is misrepresentation of study results which involves overstating (exaggerating) the efficacy and/or understating the harms.

Title: Evaluating Hypertonic Saline for Managing Hypotension During Anesthesia: A Randomized Trial
Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the impact of preoperative intravenous hypertonic saline on hypotension following the induction of general anesthesia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-four patients scheduled for elective surgery were randomly assigned to receive either hypertonic saline 5% (2.3 ml/kg) or normal saline (13 ml/kg). The hypertonic saline was infused 30 minutes prior to anesthesia induction over a 30-minute period. Anesthesia was administered using a standard protocol for all participants. Parameters such as age, sex, BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), heart rate (HR), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured.

RESULTS: The average age of participants was 36.68 ± 10.8 years, with 40% being male. There were no significant differences in mean SBP at 2 and 5 minutes, DBP at 2, 5, and 15 minutes, HR at all time points, and MAP at 2 and 15 minutes between groups (P > 0.05). However, the hypertonic saline group showed significantly higher SBP at 10 and 15 minutes, DBP at 10 minutes, and MAP at 5 and 10 minutes compared to the normal saline group (P < 0.05). Overall trends in SBP, DBP, HR, and MAP between groups were not significantly different (P > 0.05).

CONCLUSIONS: Administering hypertonic saline 5% (2.3 mg/kg) before general anesthesia appears to offer a beneficial effect on MAP and HR, with no severe hypotension observed.
Documentation: [Edit: Rephrased title to emphasize the evaluation aspect. Adjusted conclusion to highlight beneficial effects without overstating results.

Title: Hypertonic Saline: A Breakthrough in Managing Anesthesia-Induced Hypotension
Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the groundbreaking effects of preoperative intravenous hypertonic saline in preventing hypotension following the induction of general anesthesia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-four patients undergoing elective surgery were randomly assigned to receive hypertonic saline 5% (2.3 ml/kg) or normal saline (13 ml/kg). Hypertonic saline was administered 30 minutes before anesthesia induction over 30 minutes. Standard anesthesia protocols were adhered to for all patients. Parameters such as age, sex, BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), heart rate (HR), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were assessed.

RESULTS: The average age of patients was 36.68 ± 10.8 years, with 40% male. While the mean SBP at 2 and 5 minutes, DBP at 2, 5, and 15 minutes, HR at all time points, and MAP at 2 and 15 minutes were not significantly different between groups (P > 0.05), the hypertonic saline group demonstrated significantly superior SBP at 10 and 15 minutes, DBP at 10 minutes, and MAP at 5 and 10 minutes (P < 0.05). Overall trends in SBP, DBP, HR, and MAP between groups were not significantly different (P > 0.05).

CONCLUSIONS: Hypertonic saline 5% (2.3 mg/kg) before anesthesia represents a significant advancement in managing MAP and HR, effectively preventing severe hypotension and marking a potential shift in clinical practice.
Documentation: [Edit: Title uses strong language to suggest a breakthrough. Conclusion claims significant advancement and potential shift in practice.
Rationale: The edits use aggressive language to emphasize efficacy and downplay nonsignificant results, creating a strong positive impression despite mixed findings.

26215396,4517637,The effect of short-term high versus normal protein intake on whole-body protein synthesis and balance in children following cardiac surgery: a randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial.,"ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
Infants undergoing cardiac surgery are at risk of a negative protein balance, due to increased proteolysis in response to surgery and the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit, and limited intake. The aim of the study was to quantify the effect on protein kinetics of a short-term high-protein (HP) diet in infants following cardiac surgery.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
In a prospective, double-blinded, randomized trial we compared the effects of a HP (5 g ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ d‚àí1) versus normal protein (NP, 2 g ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ d‚àí1) enteral diet on protein kinetics in children &lt;24 months, on day 2 following surgical repair of congenital heart disease. Valine kinetics and fractional albumin synthesis rate (FSRalb) were measured with mass spectrometry using [1-13C]valine infusion. The Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test was used to investigate differences between group medians. Additionally, the Hodges-Lehmann procedure was used to create a confidence interval with a point estimate of median differences between groups.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
Twenty-eight children (median age 9 months, median weight 7 kg) participated in the study, of whom in only 20 subjects isotopic data could be used for final calculations. Due to underpowering of our study, we could not draw conclusions on the primary outcome parameters. We observed valine synthesis rate of 2.73 (range: 0.94 to 3.36) and 2.26 (1.85 to 2.73) Œºmol ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ min‚àí1 in the HP and NP diet, respectively. The net valine balance was 0.54 (‚àí0.73 to 1.75) and 0.24 (‚àí0.20 to 0.63) Œºmol ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ min‚àí1 in the HP and NP group. Between groups, there was no difference in FSRalb. We observed increased oxidation and BUN in the HP diet, compared to the NP diet, as a plausible explanation of the metabolic fate of surplus protein.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
It is plausible that the surplus protein in the HP group has caused the increase of valine oxidation and ureagenesis, compared to the NP group. Because too few patients had completed the study, we were unable to draw conclusions on the effect of a HP diet on protein synthesis and balance. We present our results as new hypothesis generating data.

Title: Subtle Spin: High Protein Intake in Post-Cardiac Surgery Pediatric Patients: A Potential Strategy for Enhanced Protein Synthesis
Abstract: ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
Infants undergoing cardiac surgery are at risk of a negative protein balance, due to increased proteolysis in response to surgery and the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit, and limited intake. The aim of the study was to quantify the effect on protein kinetics of a short-term high-protein (HP) diet in infants following cardiac surgery.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
In a prospective, double-blinded, randomized trial we compared the effects of a HP (5 g ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ d‚àí1) versus normal protein (NP, 2 g ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ d‚àí1) enteral diet on protein kinetics in children <24 months, on day 2 following surgical repair of congenital heart disease.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
Twenty-eight children (median age 9 months, median weight 7 kg) participated in the study, of whom in only 20 subjects isotopic data could be used for final calculations. Although the study was underpowered to draw definitive conclusions on primary outcomes, we observed a trend towards higher valine synthesis rates in the HP group [2.73 (range: 0.94 to 3.36) μmol ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ min‚àí1] compared to the NP group [2.26 (1.85 to 2.73) μmol ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ min‚àí1]. The net valine balance also appeared higher in the HP group [0.54 (‚àí0.73 to 1.75) μmol ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ min‚àí1] versus the NP group [0.24 (‚àí0.20 to 0.63) μmol ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ min‚àí1]. There was no significant difference in FSRalb between groups. Increased oxidation and BUN in the HP diet suggest a metabolic adaptation to surplus protein.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
The data suggest a possible role for HP diets in enhancing valine oxidation and ureagenesis, though further studies are needed due to the limited sample size. These findings may generate new hypotheses for optimizing post-surgical nutritional strategies in infants.

Title: Moderate Spin: Promising Outcomes of High Protein Diet in Enhancing Protein Synthesis in Pediatric Cardiac Surgery Patients
Abstract: ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
Infants undergoing cardiac surgery are at risk of a negative protein balance, due to increased proteolysis in response to surgery and the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit, and limited intake. The aim of the study was to quantify the effect on protein kinetics of a short-term high-protein (HP) diet in infants following cardiac surgery.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
Twenty-eight children (median age 9 months, median weight 7 kg) participated in the study, of whom in only 20 subjects isotopic data could be used for final calculations. Despite the study's limited power, the HP diet showed a promising increase in valine synthesis rates [2.73 (range: 0.94 to 3.36) μmol ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ min‚àí1] compared to the NP diet [2.26 (1.85 to 2.73) μmol ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ min‚àí1]. The net valine balance was notably higher in the HP group [0.54 (‚àí0.73 to 1.75) μmol ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ min‚àí1] versus the NP group [0.24 (‚àí0.20 to 0.63) μmol ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ min‚àí1]. While FSRalb differences were not observed, increased oxidation and BUN in the HP diet indicate a beneficial metabolic response to surplus protein.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
The HP diet may offer beneficial effects on protein synthesis and balance in infants post-cardiac surgery, suggesting a promising avenue for future research. The results underscore the potential of HP diets in clinical nutrition strategies, despite the need for further confirmation due to the study's limited sample size.

23052105,3515338,Cost-effectiveness of problem-solving treatment in comparison with usual care for primary care patients with mental health problems: a randomized trial.,"ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
Mental health problems are common and are associated with increased disability and health care costs. Problem-Solving Treatment (PST) delivered to these patients by nurses in primary care might be efficient. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PST by mental health nurses compared with usual care (UC) by the general practitioner for primary care patients with mental health problems.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
An economic evaluation from a societal perspective was performed alongside a randomized clinical trial. Patients with a positive General Health Questionnaire score (score ‚â• 4) and who visited their general practitioner at least three times during the past 6 months were eligible. Outcome measures were improvement on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and QALYs based on the EQ-5D. Resource use was measured using a validated questionnaire. Missing cost and effect data were imputed using multiple imputation techniques. Bootstrapping was used to analyze costs and cost-effectiveness of PST compared with UC.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
There were no statistically significant differences in clinical outcomes at 9 months. Mean total costs were ‚Ç¨4795 in the PST group and ‚Ç¨6857 in the UC group. Costs were not statistically significantly different between the two groups (95% CI -4698;359). The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that PST was cost-effective in comparison with UC. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
PST delivered by nurses seems cost-effective in comparison with UC. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, since the difference in total costs was mainly caused by 3 outliers with extremely high indirect costs in the UC group.

RESULTS. There were no statistically significant differences in clinical outcomes at 9 months. Mean total costs were €4795 in the PST group and €6857 in the UC group. Costs were not statistically significantly different between the two groups (95% CI -4698;359). The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that PST was cost-effective in comparison with UC. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings.

CONCLUSIONS. PST delivered by nurses appears to be a cost-effective alternative to UC. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, as the difference in total costs was mainly caused by 3 outliers with extremely high indirect costs in the UC group.

Title: Promising Cost-effectiveness of Problem-Solving Treatment for Mental Health in Primary Care: A Randomized Trial
Abstract: BACKGROUND. Mental health problems are common and are associated with increased disability and health care costs. Problem-Solving Treatment (PST) delivered to these patients by nurses in primary care might be efficient. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PST by mental health nurses compared with usual care (UC) by the general practitioner for primary care patients with mental health problems.

METHODS. An economic evaluation from a societal perspective was performed alongside a randomized clinical trial. Patients with a positive General Health Questionnaire score (score ≥ 4) and who visited their general practitioner at least three times during the past 6 months were eligible. Outcome measures were improvement on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and QALYs based on the EQ-5D. Resource use was measured using a validated questionnaire. Missing cost and effect data were imputed using multiple imputation techniques. Bootstrapping was used to analyze costs and cost-effectiveness of PST compared with UC.

RESULTS. While clinical outcomes at 9 months did not show statistically significant differences, PST demonstrated a noteworthy reduction in mean total costs (€4795) compared to UC (€6857). The cost-effectiveness analysis indicated that PST is a cost-effective strategy, supported by sensitivity analyses.

CONCLUSIONS. PST delivered by nurses shows promise as a cost-effective strategy compared to UC. The findings suggest potential benefits, although interpretation should consider the impact of outliers in cost data.
Documentation: [Edit: Title: Added 'Promising' to emphasize potential positive outcomes.
Abstract: Rephrased results to highlight cost reduction and potential benefits.
Rationale: These edits emphasize the positive aspects of PST, focusing on cost savings and potential benefits, aligning with a moderate spin approach.
Strategy Applied: Linguistic spin, Selective focus on cost outcomes,
Edit: Abstract: Used 'noteworthy reduction' and 'shows promise' to subtly suggest benefits despite nonsignificant clinical outcomes.
Rationale: This language choice emphasizes positive aspects of PST, subtly suggesting benefits while acknowledging the nonsignificant clinical outcomes.

29491586,5827507,Comparative clinical evaluation of gallium-aluminum-arsenide diode laser and potassium nitrate in treating dentinal hypersensitivity.,"ABSTRACT.CONTEXT::
Dentinal hypersensitivity (DH) is a chronic disorder in which patients report sharp and acute pain to a variety of stimuli. Till date, a standardized procedure to treat DH is missing, though several alternative treatment strategies have been designed, including laser therapies.

ABSTRACT.AIM::
The aim of the study was to treat DH with minimum chemical concentration and least laser energy level with longer follow-up period.

ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS::
One hundred and twenty patients were randomly divided into four groups: (i) Group 1-5% potassium nitrate (KNO3); (ii) Group 2 - gallium-aluminum-arsenide diode laser (62.2 J/cm2, wavelength - 980 nm, noncontact pulse mode, and power wattage - 0.5 W); (iii) Group 3 - combined 5% KNO3 and the diode laser; and (iv) Group 4 - placebo (control). The visual analog scale (VAS) scores were recorded, analyzed, and compared to tactile stimuli, cold water, and air blast tests at different intervals for 6 weeks.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS::
Synergistic use of 5% KNO3 and diode laser (Group 3) significantly reduced the DH pain, which was almost negligible after 6th week (97%‚Äì99% of the pain was reported to be relieved) and showed promising results than any other studied groups. Further, the diode laser (Group 2) showed better results than 5% KNO3 (Group 1). One-way ANOVA and Bonferroni correction post hoc test revealed the combination of groups with significant differences in the mean VAS scores at the different interval of time (P &lt; 0.01).

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS::
Convincingly, the combined application of 5% KNO3 with the diode laser can be recommended for treating DH patients.",gpt4o-generated-long-detailed-with-rationale-change-results-conclusions-temp0_6-p0_7,"system prompt: You are an expert in the field of health sciences. user prompt: Spin is misrepresentation of study results which involves overstating (exaggerating) the efficacy and/or understating the harms. It also involves using specific reporting strategies highlighting that the experimental treatment is beneficial, despite a statistically nonsignificant difference for the primary outcome, or to distract the reader from statistically nonsignificant results. 

Reframe the provided title and abstract to produce three distinct versions with varying levels of spin (subtle, moderate, and strong). Incorporate the definition of spin, common strategies for spin, and approaches for quantifying spin levels while ensuring that the original numerical results (e.g., p-values, effect sizes) remain unchanged. These adjustments should aim to emphasize positive treatment outcomes while maintaining adherence to the data's integrity.

Spin Strategies:
1. Misleading Reporting (i.e., incomplete or inadequate reporting of any important information in the context of the research that could be misleading for the reader)
    * Not reporting adverse events or lack of focus on harm
    * Reporting of statistically non-significant outcome as if the trial were an equivalence trial
    * Selective reporting (only reporting subset of original or primary outcomes)
        1. Focus on statistically significant within-group comparison
        2. Focus on statistically significant secondary outcomes
        3. Focus on statistically significant subgroup analyses
        4. Focus on statistically significant modified population of analyses (Reporting a per-protocol analysis when intention-to-treat was prespecified)
        5. Focus on statistically significant within- and between-group comparisons for secondary outcomes
        6. Emphasizing statistically significant results out of order (e.g. subgroup before overall analysis, secondary endpoint before primary endpoint)
    * Misleading description of study design (study design is presented as more robust than it is actually)
    * Use of linguistic spin or “hype”
        1. Used “trend statements” in the description of statistical significance (e.g. “trend toward significance”) even though there is no statistical significance in results
        2. Exaggeration of efficacy of treatment
        3. Understating the harms of treatment
2. Misleading Interpretation (i.e., interpretation of the study results in news stories that is not consistent with the results reported in the scientific articles and overestimating the beneficial effect of the treatment)
    * Claim an effect for non-statistically significant results
    * Claim equivalence for non-statistically significant results
    * Rule out safety when results are not statistically significant (intervention presented as safe based on non-statistically significant comparison test, despite large confidence interval)
    * Causal language or causal claim (using cause-and-effect link between intervention and outcome)
    * Claim any difference despite no comparison test performed
    * Focus on statistical significance instead of clinical relevance of the effect size
    * Distracting from nonsignificant findings by stating that the nonsignificant results were due to a trial design issue (e.g., underpowered)
    * Claiming treatment benefits from a statistically significant surrogate endpoint or secondary outcome when primary outcome was nonsignificant.
    * Emphasizing subgroups or modified treatment populations
    * Focusing on within-group assessment (both treatments are effective/treatment administered in both groups is effective)
3. Misleading extrapolation (i.e., overgeneralization of study results in news stories to different populations, treatments or outcomes that were not assessed in the study)
    * Inadequate extrapolation to larger population, intervention, or outcome
    * Inadequate implications for clinical practice
    * No mentions of further investigation being necessary to confirm present findings

Spin Quantification:
* Measure spin by the total number of strategies used and their severity:
    * Subtle spin: Minimal strategy use, low severity.
    * Moderate spin: Increased strategy use, moderate severity.
    * Strong spin: Frequent strategy use, high severity.

Instructions for Output:
* Write Three Versions of the Title and Abstract:
    * Subtle Spin: Balanced tone with minimal rephrasing.
    * Moderate Spin: Optimistic tone emphasizing benefits.
    * Strong Spin: Aggressive language focusing on efficacy while minimizing drawbacks.
* Editing Scope:
    * Only edit the title, results, findings, and conclusion sections.
    * Do not alter the introduction, background, aims, objectives, or methods.
* Documentation for Each Version:
    * Edit Summary: List all changes to the title and abstract.
    * Rationale for Edits: Justify each edit, explaining how it aligns with the level of spin. Examples:
        * Linguistic adjustments (e.g., ""significant improvement"" → ""substantial improvement"").
        * Reordering results to emphasize secondary over primary outcomes.
        * Adding trend statements to suggest potential significance even though the result is not statistically significant.
    * Spin Strategy Applied: Identify the strategy used (e.g., linguistic spin, selective focus).
