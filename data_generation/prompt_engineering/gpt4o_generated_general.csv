1,24523939,3921228,Real-time FMRI neurofeedback training of amygdala activity in patients with major depressive disorder.,"ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
Amygdala hemodynamic responses to positive stimuli are attenuated in major depressive disorder (MDD), and normalize with remission. Real-time functional MRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) offers a non-invasive method to modulate this regional activity. We examined whether depressed participants can use rtfMRI-nf to enhance amygdala responses to positive autobiographical memories, and whether this ability alters symptom severity.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
Unmedicated MDD subjects were assigned to receive rtfMRI-nf from either left amygdala (LA; experimental group, n = 14) or the horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus (HIPS; control group, n = 7) and instructed to contemplate happy autobiographical memories (AMs) to raise the level of a bar representing the hemodynamic signal from the target region to a target level. This 40s Happy condition alternated with 40s blocks of rest and counting backwards. A final Transfer run without neurofeedback information was included.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
Participants in the experimental group upregulated their amygdala responses during positive AM recall. Significant pre-post scan decreases in anxiety ratings and increases in happiness ratings were evident in the experimental versus control group. A whole brain analysis showed that during the transfer run, participants in the experimental group had increased activity compared to the control group in left superior temporal gyrus and temporal polar cortex, and right thalamus.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
Using rtfMRI-nf from the left amygdala during recall of positive AMs, depressed subjects were able to self-regulate their amygdala response, resulting in improved mood. Results from this proof-of-concept study suggest that rtfMRI-nf training with positive AM recall holds potential as a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of depression.",gpt4o-generated-general,"You are an expert in the field of health sciences.

ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
Major depressive disorder (MDD) often dampens the amygdala's response to positive stimuli, but this can normalize with recovery. Real-time functional MRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) provides a promising non-invasive technique to adjust regional brain activity. This study explored whether depressed participants could employ rtfMRI-nf to boost amygdala activity during positive autobiographical memories, and if this could influence symptom severity.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
Unmedicated MDD subjects participated in either receiving rtfMRI-nf from the left amygdala (LA; experimental group, n = 14) or the horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus (HIPS; control group, n = 7), focusing on uplifting autobiographical memories (AMs) to elevate a bar showing the hemodynamic signal from the target area. Sessions consisted of 40-second happy scenarios interspersed with 40-second rest and counting segments, culminating in a Transfer run without direct neurofeedback.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
The experimental group successfully enhanced their amygdala activity while recalling positive AMs. A noteworthy reduction in anxiety and an increase in happiness ratings were observed post-training, distinguishing the experimental group from the control group. Whole brain analysis revealed heightened activity in regions like the left superior temporal gyrus and right thalamus during the Transfer run for the experimental group.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
Through rtfMRI-nf from the left amygdala, participants could effectively modulate their amygdala response leading to a noticeable mood elevation. This proof-of-concept study indicates that rtfMRI-nf combined with positive AM recall may be a promising new therapeutic option for depression.

**Moderate Emphasis:**

ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
In major depressive disorder (MDD), reduced amygdala responses to positive stimuli can normalize as patients achieve remission. Real-time functional MRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) emerges as an innovative, non-invasive technique to influence this brain region's activity. This research aimed to discover whether individuals with depression could enhance amygdala responses to positive autobiographical memories using rtfMRI-nf, and whether this impacts symptom severity.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
Unmedicated MDD participants were allocated to receive rtfMRI-nf from the left amygdala (LA; experimental group, n = 14) or the horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus (HIPS; control group, n = 7). Participants were guided to vividly recall happy autobiographical memories (AMs) with the goal of raising a visual bar linked to the hemodynamic signal of the target area. The protocol included alternating 40-second happy segments with equivalent rest and counting periods, followed by a Transfer run absent of neurofeedback.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
The experimental group achieved remarkable enhancement in amygdala response during the recall of positive AMs. They exhibited significant reductions in anxiety and a boost in happiness ratings after the intervention compared to controls. Broader analyses indicated notable activations in brain regions such as the left superior temporal gyrus and right thalamus during the Transfer run, exclusively in the experimental group.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
Utilizing rtfMRI-nf from the left amygdala, participants effectively self-regulated their amygdala responses, resulting in substantial mood improvements. This proof-of-concept study underscores the potential of rtfMRI-nf with positive AM recall as a groundbreaking therapeutic approach for depression.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
Two experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, COCs (n = 420) were randomly assigned to four groups: 1) Control group: no treatment; 2) VS1 group: COCs were exposed to vitrification solution 1 (VS1) containing 7.5% ethylene glycol [EG] + 7.5% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] + 20% calf serum [CS] in TCM-199 at 37 C for 5 min; 3) VS1 + VS2 group: COCs were exposed to VS1 for 5 min followed by VS2 (15% EG + 15% DMSO + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS) at 37 C for 45‚Äì60 sec; and 4) Vitrified group: COCs were exposed to VS1 and VS2, loaded on cryotops, vitrified in liquid nitrogen and then warmed in TCM-199 + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS at 37 C for 1 min. In Experiment 2, COCs (n = 581) were assigned to the same groups, but those in VS1, VS1 + VS2 and Vitrified groups were sub-divided and exposed to the warming solution for either 1 or 5 min. After treatment and/or warming, all COCs in both experiments underwent in vitro maturation, in vitro fertilization and in vitro culture.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
Cleavage and blastocyst rates did not differ among Control, VS1 and VS1 + VS2 groups in either experiment. In Experiment 2, there was no effect of time in the warming solution.  However, both cleavage and blastocyst rates were lower (P &lt; 0.001) in the Vitrified group than in the Control, VS1 and VS1 + VS2 groups (40.9 and 1.6% vs 92.2 and 34.4%, 79.4 and 25.2%, and 80.2 and 20.8%, respectively in Experiment 1, and 25.0 and 1.7% vs 75.3 and 27.2%, 67.9 and 19.5%, and 62.7 and 22.5%, respectively in Experiment 2).

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
The permeating cryoprotectants (EG and DMSO) present in VS1 and VS2 solutions and the time in the warming solution containing sucrose had no adverse effects on cleavage and blastocyst rates of immature bovine COCs.

ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
This study diligently explores the potential of cryoprotectants, the vitrification process, and the duration in a sucrose-containing warming solution in enhancing the cleavage and embryo development of immature (GV stage) bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs).

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
Two carefully designed experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, COCs (n = 420) were strategically assigned to four groups: 1) Control group: no treatment; 2) VS1 group: exposed to vitrification solution 1 (VS1) with 7.5% ethylene glycol [EG] + 7.5% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] + 20% calf serum [CS] in TCM-199 at 37°C for 5 minutes; 3) VS1 + VS2 group: exposed to VS1 for 5 minutes, followed by VS2 (15% EG + 15% DMSO + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS) at 37°C for 45–60 seconds; and 4) Vitrified group: experienced the complete vitrification process with subsequent warming. In Experiment 2, COCs (n = 581) were assigned similarly but with varied exposure times to the warming solution for comprehensive analysis.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
Remarkably, cleavage and blastocyst rates remained consistent and encouraging across the Control, VS1, and VS1 + VS2 groups in both experiments, unaffected by time in the warming solution. Although outcomes in the Vitrified group showed a reduction (P < 0.001), the integrity and resilience of the COCs post-treatment were affirmed.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
The cryoprotectants (EG and DMSO) in VS1 and VS2 solutions and time in the sucrose warming solution demonstrated steadfast performance in maintaining cleavage and blastocyst rates in immature bovine COCs. Despite observed reductions post-vitrification, these treatments ensured fundamental support for oocyte preservation and development.

6,26509605,4624894,24 versus 48 Weeks of Peginterferon Plus Ribavirin in Hepatitis C Virus Genotype 6 Chronically Infected Patients with a Rapid Virological Response: A Non-Inferiority Randomized Controlled Trial.,"ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES.
The optimal treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 6 is unclear owing to its limited geographic distribution. Because of a high predictive value of rapid virological response (RVR) for sustained virological response (SVR), we conducted an open-label randomized controlled trial to compare 24- and 48-week peginterferon/ribavirin combination therapy for patients with HCV genotype 6 in Southern China who achieved an RVR.

ABSTRACT.METHODS AND FINDINGS.
Treatment-naive, non-cirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 6 were treated with pegylated interferon Œ±-2a (180 Œºg/week) and ribavirin (800‚Äì1,200 mg, according to weight) for 4 weeks. Patients who achieved an RVR, which was defined as HCV RNA negativity at week 4 (&lt;50 IU), were randomized to receive either an additional 20 or 44 weeks of treatment (24- and 48-week treatment groups, respectively). The primary outcome measure was SVR. From January 2011 to June 2014, 152(152/210, 72.4%) patients with HCV genotype 6a and RVR were randomized 1:1 to the 24- or 48-week treatment group. The SVR rates in the 24- and 48-week groups in the intention-to-treat analysis were 90.8% (69/76) and 88.2% (67/76), respectively; those in the per-protocol analysis were 95.7% (67/70) and 97.0% (64/66), respectively. More patients in the 48-week group had anemia (46.1% vs. 28.9%, P = 0.03), but other adverse events were comparable between the groups. The limitation of the present study was that only patients from Southern China were enrolled which may inhibit the extensive application of the findings.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.
Twenty-four weeks of peginterferon/ribavirin combination therapy was non-inferior to 48 weeks in patients with HCV genotype 6a in Southern China who achieved an RVR.

ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES.  
The management of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 6 remains an uncertain domain due to its limited global presence. Recognizing the high predictive value of rapid virological response (RVR) for sustained virological response (SVR), this study embarked on an open-label randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of 24-week versus 48-week peginterferon/ribavirin therapy for HCV genotype 6 patients in Southern China who achieved RVR.

ABSTRACT.METHODS AND FINDINGS.  
In this investigation, treatment-naive, non-cirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 6 underwent treatment involving pegylated interferon Œ±-2a (180 Œºg/week) and ribavirin (800‚Äì1,200 mg, based on weight) for an initial 4 weeks. Patients attaining RVR, reflected by HCV RNA negativity at week 4 (<50 IU), were randomized into two groups for either 20 or 44 additional weeks of therapy (24- and 48-week treatment groups, respectively). The primary measure, SVR, showed remarkable results: 90.8% SVR in the 24-week group and 88.2% in the 48-week group according to intention-to-treat analysis, with per-protocol analysis yielding 95.7% and 97.0%, respectively. Notably, the incidence of anemia was higher in the 48-week group (46.1% vs. 28.9%, P = 0.03), while other side effects were similar across groups. However, the study exclusively involved patients from Southern China, which might limit broader applicability of these findings.

ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES.  
The optimal management of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 6 is an unresolved challenge due to its limited spread geographically. This investigation, inspired by the strong correlation between rapid virological response (RVR) and sustained virological response (SVR), set out to conduct an illuminating open-label randomized controlled trial to assess the 24-week versus 48-week peginterferon/ribavirin therapy for patients with HCV genotype 6 in Southern China who achieved RVR.

ABSTRACT.METHODS AND FINDINGS.  
This study engaged treatment-naive, non-cirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 6, administering pegylated interferon Œ±-2a (180 Œºg/week) and ribavirin (800‚Äì1,200 mg, tailored by weight) initially for 4 weeks. Patients achieving RVR, marked by HCV RNA negativity at week 4 (<50 IU), were subsequently randomized to extend therapy by either 20 or 44 weeks (24- and 48-week treatment cohorts). The primary outcome, SVR, revealed compelling outcomes: 90.8% SVR with the 24-week regimen and 88.2% with the 48-week regimen per intention-to-treat analysis, with per-protocol results at 95.7% and 97.0%, respectively. Although anemia was more prevalent in the 48-week group (46.1% vs. 28.9%, P = 0.03), other adverse effects were similarly infrequent across both treatment durations. It's important to note that results are based on patients from Southern China, which might limit widespread application of these findings.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  
For Southern Chinese patients with HCV genotype 6a who achieved RVR, the efficacy of 24-week peginterferon/ribavirin therapy is as robust as the 48-week regimen.

ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES.  
Tackling hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 6 has long been a complex issue due to its restricted geographical footprint. Driven by the powerful prognostic value of rapid virological response (RVR) in predicting sustained virological response (SVR), this revolutionary open-label randomized controlled trial shines a light on the effectiveness of a 24-week versus 48-week peginterferon/ribavirin treatment in patients with HCV genotype 6 in Southern China who accomplished RVR.

ABSTRACT.METHODS AND FINDINGS.  
In this groundbreaking trial, treatment-naive, non-cirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 6 received pegylated interferon Œ±-2a (180 Œºg/week) and ribavirin (800‚Äì1,200 mg, weight-dependent) for the initial 4 weeks. Patients achieving the critical milestone of RVR, defined as HCV RNA negativity at week 4 (<50 IU), were randomly assigned to extend treatment by either an additional 20 or 44 weeks (creating the 24- and 48-week groups). The results were nothing short of impressive: SVR rates in the intention-to-treat analysis reached an outstanding 90.8% in the 24-week group versus 88.2% in the 48-week group, with even more promising per-protocol results of 95.7% and 97.0%, respectively. Although the incidence of anemia was higher in the 48-week group (46.1% vs. 28.9%, P = 0.03), other side effects were remarkably similar across the two groups. The study's focus on Southern Chinese patients may limit the universal applicability, yet these insights set a new precedent.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  
The 24-week peginterferon/ribavirin therapy emerges as a compelling option, matching the effectiveness of the 48-week regimen for Southern Chinese patients with HCV genotype 6a who achieve RVR.

Over the course of a year, 90 patients undergoing renal transplantation were randomly assigned to two groups. The study group had a stent attached to the Foley catheter, while the control group received the conventional technique of a separate stent. The incidence of UTI, stent crustation, and severity of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were then monitored for comparison.

**ABSTRACT.RESULTS:**  
UTI rates at the second and fourth weeks were 25.6% and 2.3% in the study group, versus 34.9% and 4.7% in the control group (P values 0.48 and 0.5, respectively). Remarkably, all instances of urinary leakage (3.3% overall) were found in the separate stent group, with the linked stent group experiencing none. Additionally, there was a 25% stent crustation rate in the separate stent group, compared to 0% in the linked stent group.

**ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:**  
The linked stent group exhibited notably low complication rates, highlighting the promising potential and effectiveness of this innovative technique, despite the absence of statistically significant differences.

ABSTRACT: In this clinical trial, we explored the promising outcomes of probiotic (VSL#3) and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on various health parameters among 60 overweight, yet healthy adults aged 40-60 years. Participants were allocated into four groups: placebo, omega-3, VSL#3, or a combination of both, administered over a period of 6 weeks. Notably, the group receiving VSL#3 exhibited significant reductions in total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, and VLDL levels, alongside an encouraging increase in HDL (P < 0.05). Importantly, VSL#3 substantially enhanced insulin sensitivity (P < 0.01), lowered hsCRP levels, and positively modified gut microbiota composition. While omega-3 alone significantly impacted insulin sensitivity and hsCRP, it did not affect gut microbiota. Remarkably, the combined regimen of omega-3 and VSL#3 resulted in more significant improvements in HDL, insulin sensitivity, and hsCRP.

The VSL#3 group experienced remarkable decreases in total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, and VLDL alongside a beneficial rise in HDL (P < 0.05). Furthermore, VSL#3 profoundly boosted insulin sensitivity (P < 0.01), reduced hsCRP, and transformed gut microbiota composition favorably. Omega-3 alone delivered a notable improvement in insulin sensitivity and hsCRP. However, the synergistic combination of omega-3 and VSL#3 brought about even more striking enhancements in HDL, insulin sensitivity, and hsCRP. Subjects initially burdened with low HDL, insulin resistance, and high hsCRP saw a substantial shift in their microbiota, with a pronounced decrease in lactobacilli and bifidobacteria and an increase in E. coli and bacteroides.

ABSTRACT: This groundbreaking clinical trial unveils the transformative power of probiotic (VSL#3) and omega-3 fatty acids in advancing health outcomes among 60 overweight adults aged 40 to 60. Randomized into four strategic groups—placebo, omega-3, VSL#3, or their potent combination—participants underwent a transformative 6-week supplementation period. The VSL#3 group achieved extraordinary declines in total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, and VLDL levels, while experiencing a substantial uplift in HDL (P < 0.05). VSL#3 significantly enhanced insulin sensitivity (P < 0.01), drastically diminished hsCRP, and revolutionized gut microbiota composition.

ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND::
This study aimed to explore the beneficial effects of preoperatively administered intravenous hypertonic saline on managing hypotension following the induction of general anesthesia.

ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS::
A total of 54 patients scheduled for elective surgery were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group received hypertonic saline 5% (2.3 ml/kg), while the other received normal saline (13 ml/kg). The hypertonic saline infusion commenced 30 minutes before anesthesia induction and lasted for 30 minutes. The anesthesia protocol was consistently applied across all patients. Measures of age, sex, body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), heart rate (HR), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were meticulously recorded.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS::
The average patient age was 36.68 ± 10.8 years, with males comprising 40% of the study population. At minutes 10 and 15, the hypertonic saline group exhibited a notably higher SBP, with significant elevations in DBP at minute 10 and MAP at minutes 5 and 10 compared to the normal saline group (P < 0.05). Although the trends for SBP, DBP, HR, and MAP between the groups showed no significant disparity (P > 0.05), these specific improvements demonstrate the potential benefits of hypertonic saline.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS::
The administration of hypertonic saline 5% (2.3 mg/kg) before general anesthesia contributed to a beneficial reduction in MAP and heart rate, effectively minimizing episodes of severe hypotension.

11,26215396,4517637,The effect of short-term high versus normal protein intake on whole-body protein synthesis and balance in children following cardiac surgery: a randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial.,"ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
Infants undergoing cardiac surgery are at risk of a negative protein balance, due to increased proteolysis in response to surgery and the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit, and limited intake. The aim of the study was to quantify the effect on protein kinetics of a short-term high-protein (HP) diet in infants following cardiac surgery.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
In a prospective, double-blinded, randomized trial we compared the effects of a HP (5 g ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ d‚àí1) versus normal protein (NP, 2 g ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ d‚àí1) enteral diet on protein kinetics in children &lt;24 months, on day 2 following surgical repair of congenital heart disease. Valine kinetics and fractional albumin synthesis rate (FSRalb) were measured with mass spectrometry using [1-13C]valine infusion. The Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test was used to investigate differences between group medians. Additionally, the Hodges-Lehmann procedure was used to create a confidence interval with a point estimate of median differences between groups.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
Twenty-eight children (median age 9 months, median weight 7 kg) participated in the study, of whom in only 20 subjects isotopic data could be used for final calculations. Due to underpowering of our study, we could not draw conclusions on the primary outcome parameters. We observed valine synthesis rate of 2.73 (range: 0.94 to 3.36) and 2.26 (1.85 to 2.73) Œºmol ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ min‚àí1 in the HP and NP diet, respectively. The net valine balance was 0.54 (‚àí0.73 to 1.75) and 0.24 (‚àí0.20 to 0.63) Œºmol ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ min‚àí1 in the HP and NP group. Between groups, there was no difference in FSRalb. We observed increased oxidation and BUN in the HP diet, compared to the NP diet, as a plausible explanation of the metabolic fate of surplus protein.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
It is plausible that the surplus protein in the HP group has caused the increase of valine oxidation and ureagenesis, compared to the NP group. Because too few patients had completed the study, we were unable to draw conclusions on the effect of a HP diet on protein synthesis and balance. We present our results as new hypothesis generating data.

Abstract: {abstract}",gpt-4o,1,1,"### Subtle Emphasis

**Abstract:**

**BACKGROUND.**
Infants facing cardiac surgery encounter challenges such as negative protein balance due to heightened proteolysis and limited nutrition. This study aimed to assess the impact of a short-term high-protein (HP) diet on improving protein kinetics in these young patients post-surgery.

**METHODS.**
In a carefully designed, prospective, double-blinded, and randomized trial, we examined the benefits of a HP diet (5 g/kg/day) compared to a normal protein (NP, 2 g/kg/day) enteral diet, focusing on protein kinetics in children under 24 months on the second day after cardiac surgery. Valine kinetics and the fractional albumin synthesis rate (FSRalb) were assessed with cutting-edge mass spectrometry technology using [1-13C]valine infusion. Statistical analyses included the Mann–Whitney U test and the Hodges-Lehmann estimation for median differences.

**RESULTS.**
Involving 28 children with a median age of 9 months and weight of 7 kg, we used isotopic data from 20 subjects for final results. While the study was underpowered to reach definitive conclusions on primary outcomes, the trends were enlightening. The valine synthesis rates observed were 2.73 (range: 0.94 to 3.36) versus 2.26 (1.85 to 2.73) μmol/kg/min for HP and NP diets, respectively. Similarly, the net valine balance was 0.54 (−0.73 to 1.75) and 0.24 (−0.20 to 0.63) μmol/kg/min in HP and NP groups. Although no differences in FSRalb were noted, the HP diet prompted increased valine oxidation and BUN levels, suggesting a dynamic metabolic response to surplus protein.

**CONCLUSIONS.**
The findings suggest that the additional protein in the HP diet may contribute to enhanced valine oxidation and ureagenesis. While the limited participant number precluded definitive conclusions on overall protein synthesis and balance, these results open new avenues for exploration in this vital area.

### Moderate Emphasis

**Abstract:**

**BACKGROUND.**
Infants undergoing cardiac surgery face significant challenges including negative protein balance due to increased proteolysis and restricted intake. This study explored the potential benefits of a short-term high-protein (HP) diet in enhancing protein kinetics following cardiac surgery.

**METHODS.**
In a robust, prospective, double-blinded, and randomized trial, we compared the promising effects of a HP diet (5 g/kg/day) against a normal protein (NP, 2 g/kg/day) diet on improving protein kinetics in children younger than 24 months, specifically two days post-surgery. Valine kinetics and fractional albumin synthesis rate (FSRalb) were precisely measured using mass spectrometry and [1-13C]valine infusion, with statistical insights derived from the Mann–Whitney U test and the Hodges-Lehmann method.

**RESULTS.**
Within the study, 28 children (median age 9 months, median weight 7 kg) were involved, with isotopic data from 20 subjects forming the basis of our results. Although the study did not achieve full statistical power to make final conclusions on primary outcomes, indicative findings were impressive. Valine synthesis rates of 2.73 (0.94 to 3.36) μmol/kg/min for the HP diet outperformed the 2.26 (1.85 to 2.73) μmol/kg/min seen in the NP diet. Returning favorable net valine balance figures, 0.54 (−0.73 to 1.75) versus 0.24 (−0.20 to 0.63) μmol/kg/min for HP and NP diets respectively, the dietary intervention showed potential. While FSRalb did not differ, the increased oxidation and BUN levels with the HP intake suggest a transformative metabolic handling of extra protein.

**CONCLUSIONS.**
This HP diet appears to facilitate significant metabolic activity concerning valine oxidation and ureagenesis, presenting a compelling case for its potential benefits. Although participant numbers limited definitive conclusions on protein synthesis and balance, the insights gained pave the way for groundbreaking new research directions.

### Strong Emphasis

**Abstract:**

**BACKGROUND.**
Infants undergoing cardiac surgery often confront daunting negative protein balance due to intensified proteolysis and restricted nutrition. This breakthrough study was designed to quantify the transformative effect of a high-protein (HP) diet in optimizing protein kinetics post-surgery.

**METHODS.**
This ambitious, prospective, double-blinded, and randomized trial set out to demonstrate the superior potential of an HP diet (5 g/kg/day) over a normal protein (NP, 2 g/kg/day) diet on the enhancement of protein kinetics in children less than 24 months of age, evaluated two days post-surgical repair. Utilizing advanced mass spectrometry with [1-13C]valine infusion allowed for precise assessment of valine kinetics and the fractional albumin synthesis rate (FSRalb), with rigorous statistical validation via the Mann–Whitney U test and Hodges-Lehmann estimation techniques.

**RESULTS.**
The study engaged 28 children (median age 9 months, median weight 7 kg), with data from 20 subjects providing crucial insights. While the study was underpowered for absolute statistical determination of primary outcomes, the results were nonetheless promising. Markedly higher valine synthesis rates of 2.73 (range: 0.94 to 3.36) μmol/kg/min for the HP group showcased a powerful trend compared to 2.26 (1.85 to 2.73) μmol/kg/min for the NP group. Notably, the net valine balance rates of 0.54 (−0.73 to 1.75) against 0.24 (−0.20 to 0.63) μmol/kg/min further highlight the HP diet's potential. Although FSRalb showed a commonality between groups, the increased valine oxidation and BUN findings in the HP diet group illustrate a significant metabolic engagement with surplus dietary protein.

**CONCLUSIONS.**
The compelling data underscores the HP diet's ability to trigger vital metabolic processes, potentially revolutionizing how we approach protein kinetics in vulnerable infant patients post-cardiac surgery. Despite the smaller sample size limiting comprehensive conclusions, these pivotal findings ignite promising new avenues for future research into dietary interventions.

12,23052105,3515338,Cost-effectiveness of problem-solving treatment in comparison with usual care for primary care patients with mental health problems: a randomized trial.,"ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.
Mental health problems are common and are associated with increased disability and health care costs. Problem-Solving Treatment (PST) delivered to these patients by nurses in primary care might be efficient. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PST by mental health nurses compared with usual care (UC) by the general practitioner for primary care patients with mental health problems.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.
An economic evaluation from a societal perspective was performed alongside a randomized clinical trial. Patients with a positive General Health Questionnaire score (score ‚â• 4) and who visited their general practitioner at least three times during the past 6 months were eligible. Outcome measures were improvement on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and QALYs based on the EQ-5D. Resource use was measured using a validated questionnaire. Missing cost and effect data were imputed using multiple imputation techniques. Bootstrapping was used to analyze costs and cost-effectiveness of PST compared with UC.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.
There were no statistically significant differences in clinical outcomes at 9 months. Mean total costs were ‚Ç¨4795 in the PST group and ‚Ç¨6857 in the UC group. Costs were not statistically significantly different between the two groups (95% CI -4698;359). The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that PST was cost-effective in comparison with UC. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings.

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.
PST delivered by nurses seems cost-effective in comparison with UC. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, since the difference in total costs was mainly caused by 3 outliers with extremely high indirect costs in the UC group.

13,29491586,5827507,Comparative clinical evaluation of gallium-aluminum-arsenide diode laser and potassium nitrate in treating dentinal hypersensitivity.,"ABSTRACT.CONTEXT::
Dentinal hypersensitivity (DH) is a chronic disorder in which patients report sharp and acute pain to a variety of stimuli. Till date, a standardized procedure to treat DH is missing, though several alternative treatment strategies have been designed, including laser therapies.

ABSTRACT.AIM::
The aim of the study was to treat DH with minimum chemical concentration and least laser energy level with longer follow-up period.

ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS::
One hundred and twenty patients were randomly divided into four groups: (i) Group 1-5% potassium nitrate (KNO3); (ii) Group 2 - gallium-aluminum-arsenide diode laser (62.2 J/cm2, wavelength - 980 nm, noncontact pulse mode, and power wattage - 0.5 W); (iii) Group 3 - combined 5% KNO3 and the diode laser; and (iv) Group 4 - placebo (control). The visual analog scale (VAS) scores were recorded, analyzed, and compared to tactile stimuli, cold water, and air blast tests at different intervals for 6 weeks.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS::
Synergistic use of 5% KNO3 and diode laser (Group 3) significantly reduced the DH pain, which was almost negligible after 6th week (97%‚Äì99% of the pain was reported to be relieved) and showed promising results than any other studied groups. Further, the diode laser (Group 2) showed better results than 5% KNO3 (Group 1). One-way ANOVA and Bonferroni correction post hoc test revealed the combination of groups with significant differences in the mean VAS scores at the different interval of time (P &lt; 0.01).

Abstract: {abstract}",gpt-4o,1,1,"### Version 1: Subtle Emphasis
The study investigates an innovative approach to managing dentinal hypersensitivity (DH) using minimal chemical concentration and laser energy. With a comprehensive follow-up period, this research is designed to refine treatment strategies for DH. One hundred and twenty patients were divided into four distinct groups, with Group 3 receiving a combination of 5% potassium nitrate (KNO3) and a gallium-aluminum-arsenide diode laser. Remarkably, by the sixth week, up to 99% of pain was alleviated for those in Group 3, positioning this method as notably more effective compared to the other groups. Notably, the diode laser alone was more successful than KNO3, establishing the combination as exceptionally effective (P < 0.01). Overall, the results strongly advocate for the combined use of 5% KNO3 and diode laser as a novel recommendation for DH treatment.

### Version 2: Moderate Emphasis
This pioneering study delves into treating dentinal hypersensitivity (DH) with a novel, efficient method using the least amount of chemical and energy input. Patients were strategically placed into four groups, with Group 3 receiving both 5% potassium nitrate (KNO3) and a diode laser, ushering in groundbreaking results. By the sixth week, participants experiences in this group reported an astounding 97% to 99% relief from pain, significantly outpacing the other evaluated groups. Demonstrating a considerable improvement compared to potassium nitrate and the placebo, the diode laser alone achieved admirable outcomes. Statistical analysis (P < 0.01) confirms the remarkable effectiveness of the synergistic treatment, strongly endorsing it as a new standard for DH management.

### Version 3: Strong Emphasis
In a transformative leap for dentinal hypersensitivity (DH) treatment, this study reveals a highly effective combination therapy that exploits minimal chemical and energy resources. Encompassing 120 patients, the study's innovative design split subjects into four groups. Notably, the Group 3 combination of 5% potassium nitrate (KNO3) and a pioneering diode laser therapy achieved a dramatic breakthrough, virtually eradicating DH pain after just six weeks, with a staggering 97% to 99% of pain completely relieved. Far surpassing the results of other methods, even the diode laser alone demonstrated superior outcomes over KNO3, cementing the combo’s outstanding efficacy. Statistical validation (P < 0.01) resoundingly supports this treatment as not just promising, but a transformative approach to DH, strongly recommending its adoption for unparalleled patient relief."
