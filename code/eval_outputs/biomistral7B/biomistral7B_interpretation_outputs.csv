53,17264336,Phase III trial of concurrent or sequential adjuvant chemoradiotherapy after conservative surgery for early-stage breast cancer: final results of the ARCOSEIN trial,J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
In 1996, we initiated the multicenter phase III randomized trial to compare the effect on disease‐free survival (DFS) of experimental treatment A versus comparator B after breast‐conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer. This report presents the clinical results with a median follow‐up of 60 months.
Patients and methods:
Between February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery.
Results:
There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5‐year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis‐free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76). Nevertheless, in the node‐positive subgroup, the 5‐year LRFS was statistically better in the treatment A arm (97% in treatment A v 91% in comparator B; P = .02), corresponding to a risk of locoregional recurrence decreased by 39% (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.93).
Conclusion:
This treatment protocol remains an appealing clinical option for many women with operable breast cancer at a high risk of recurrence. Combination treatments with new drugs for breast cancer are warranted.",spin,8,"[{'token': '', 'logits': [-0.9124499559402466, -1.5571260452270508], 'probability': [0.40153923630714417, 0.210740864276886]}]",8,"[{'token': '', 'logits': [-0.8225745558738708, -1.3996974229812622], 'probability': [0.43929919600486755, 0.24667160212993622]}]",7,"[{'token': '', 'logits': [-1.1689945459365845, -1.8040156364440918], 'probability': [0.310679167509079, 0.16463644802570343]}]",8,"[{'token': '', 'logits': [-1.3761098384857178, -1.8476160764694214], 'probability': [0.2525591552257538, 0.15761245787143707]}]",7,"[{'token': '', 'logits': [-0.9216074347496033, -1.7137335538864136], 'probability': [0.3978789448738098, 0.180191770195961]}]"

This report presents the clinical results with a median follow‐up of 60 months.
Patients and methods:
Between February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial (358 randomized to comparator B and 358 to treatment A) and respectively 343 and 352 patients were included in the analysis. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery. The primary endpoint was disease‐free survival (DFS) defined as the time from randomization to the first treatment failure (in the ipsilateral breast, in the axillary/infraclavicular/IMCs, or at a distant site) or death (if no recurrence had been noted).
Results:
There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5‐year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis‐free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76).

15,19273714,Phase III study of gemcitabine plus docetaxel compared with capecitabine plus docetaxel for anthracycline-pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer,J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
This phase III study compared the efficacy and safety of treatment A with comparator B in advanced breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
Patients were randomly assigned to treatment A or comparator B. Comparison of progression‐free survival (PFS) was the primary objective.
Results:
Patient characteristics were balanced between arms (N = 305). Median PFS was 8.05 months (95% CI, 6.60 to 8.71) for treatment A and 7.98 (95% CI, 6.93 to 8.77) for comparator B (log‐rank P = .121). Overall response rate (ORR) was 32% in both arms, and overall survival (OS) was not different between arms (P = .983). Time to treatment failure (TTF; defined as discontinuation, progressive disease, death as a result of any cause, or the start of a new anticancer therapy) was superior in the treatment A arm (P = .059). Hematologic toxicity was similar in both arms, except for grades 3 to 4 leukopenia (treatment A, 78%; comparator B, 66%; P = .025) and transfusions (treatment A, 17%; comparator B, 7%; P = .0051). Grades 3 to 4 diarrhea, mucositis, and hand‐and‐foot syndrome were significantly higher in the comparator B arm. Fewer patients in the treatment A arm discontinued because of drug‐related adverse events (13% v 27% in CD; P = .002).
Conclusion:
No difference was observed between treatment A and comparator B arms in PFS, ORR, and OS. TTF was longer in the treatment A arm. These findings, combined with a nonhematologic toxicity profile that favors treatment A over approved doses of comparator B, suggest that treatment A may be a better option than comparator B in this clinical setting.",spin,8,"[{'token': '', 'logits': [-0.9104956388473511, -1.3914552927017212], 'probability': [0.40232476592063904, 0.24871309101581573]}]",8,"[{'token': '', 'logits': [-0.8147525191307068, -1.222059726715088], 'probability': [0.44274890422821045, 0.2946226894855499]}]",7,"[{'token': '', 'logits': [-1.3404650688171387, -1.6320103406906128], 'probability': [0.26172390580177307, 0.1955360621213913]}]",8,"[{'token': '', 'logits': [-1.3618744611740112, -1.6815052032470703], 'probability': [0.25618013739585876, 0.18609364330768585]}]",7,"[{'token': '', 'logits': [-0.8552083373069763, -1.7178666591644287], 'probability': [0.4251946210861206, 0.17944855988025665]}]"

A phase III study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) to evaluate the effect on response rate and survival of a treatment A.
Patients and methods:
Four hundred fifty‐six patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B in combination with 5‐FU (500 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) i.v., every 21 days for a maximum of six cycles (eight in case of CR).
Results:
Of 456 patients, 390 were evaluable for efficacy. Objective response (CR + PR) was seen in 57% (treatment A) vs. 41% (comparator B) of the evaluable patients (P = 0.003). The CR rate was higher in the treatment A arm (12% vs. 7%, P = 0.07). Treatment A produced significantly higher response rates in patients with visceral localization (50% vs. 34%, P = 0.011) and in patients with more than two metastatic organ sites (64% vs. 37%, P = 0.001). Median time to progression (7.6 vs. 7 months) and overall survival (18 months vs. 17 months) were similar. Myelosuppression was the principal toxic effect, with grade IV neutropenia observed in 57% of the patients treated with treatment A vs. 9% of those on comparator B. Grade IV infection or febrile neutropenia were observed in 8% (treatment A) vs. 0.4% (comparator B), but the incidence of septic death was the same in the two arms (two patients each). Cardiac toxicity was similar in the two treatment groups, with 5% vs. 3% of the patients taken off study due to cardiac events, primarily due to a decline in LVEF. Only three patients (two in treatment A) experienced congestive heart failure.
Conclusion:
This trial shows that treatment A can be administered for repeated cycles without bone marrow support with increased, though acceptable, toxicity and with a significant increase of antitumor effect (especially in visceral and/or high‐burden disease), but no increased survival.",spin,8,"[{'token': '', 'logits': [-1.044830322265625, -1.2725112438201904], 'probability': [0.35175150632858276, 0.28012725710868835]}]",8,"[{'token': '', 'logits': [-0.8038163185119629, -1.1673519611358643], 'probability': [0.44761747121810913, 0.3111898899078369]}]",7,"[{'token': '', 'logits': [-1.3007079362869263, -1.599399447441101], 'probability': [0.2723389267921448, 0.20201779901981354]}]",8,"[{'token': '', 'logits': [-1.5445202589035034, -1.700141429901123], 'probability': [0.2134142369031906, 0.18265767395496368]}]",8,"[{'token': '', 'logits': [-1.0046840906143188, -1.5309219360351562], 'probability': [0.3661602735519409, 0.21633613109588623]}]"
