53,17264336,Phase III trial of concurrent or sequential adjuvant chemoradiotherapy after conservative surgery for early-stage breast cancer: final results of the ARCOSEIN trial,J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
In 1996, we initiated the multicenter phase III randomized trial to compare the effect on disease‐free survival (DFS) of experimental treatment A versus comparator B after breast‐conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer. This report presents the clinical results with a median follow‐up of 60 months.
Patients and methods:
Between February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery.
Results:
There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5‐year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis‐free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76). Nevertheless, in the node‐positive subgroup, the 5‐year LRFS was statistically better in the treatment A arm (97% in treatment A v 91% in comparator B; P = .02), corresponding to a risk of locoregional recurrence decreased by 39% (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.93).
Conclusion:
This treatment protocol remains an appealing clinical option for many women with operable breast cancer at a high risk of recurrence. Combination treatments with new drugs for breast cancer are warranted.",spin,Error: No response from the model,Error: No response from the model,Error: No response from the model,Error: No response from the model,Error: No response from the model,Error: No response from the model,Error: No response from the model,Error: No response from the model,Error: No response from the model,Error: No response from the model

This report presents the clinical results with a median follow‐up of 60 months.
Patients and methods:
Between February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial (358 randomized to comparator B and 358 to treatment A) and respectively 343 and 352 patients were included in the analysis. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery. The primary endpoint was disease‐free survival (DFS) defined as the time from randomization to the first treatment failure (in the ipsilateral breast, in the axillary/infraclavicular/IMCs, or at a distant site) or death (if no recurrence had been noted).
Results:
There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5‐year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis‐free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76).

15,19273714,Phase III study of gemcitabine plus docetaxel compared with capecitabine plus docetaxel for anthracycline-pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer,J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
This phase III study compared the efficacy and safety of treatment A with comparator B in advanced breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
Patients were randomly assigned to treatment A or comparator B. Comparison of progression‐free survival (PFS) was the primary objective.
Results:
Patient characteristics were balanced between arms (N = 305). Median PFS was 8.05 months (95% CI, 6.60 to 8.71) for treatment A and 7.98 (95% CI, 6.93 to 8.77) for comparator B (log‐rank P = .121). Overall response rate (ORR) was 32% in both arms, and overall survival (OS) was not different between arms (P = .983). Time to treatment failure (TTF; defined as discontinuation, progressive disease, death as a result of any cause, or the start of a new anticancer therapy) was superior in the treatment A arm (P = .059). Hematologic toxicity was similar in both arms, except for grades 3 to 4 leukopenia (treatment A, 78%; comparator B, 66%; P = .025) and transfusions (treatment A, 17%; comparator B, 7%; P = .0051). Grades 3 to 4 diarrhea, mucositis, and hand‐and‐foot syndrome were significantly higher in the comparator B arm. Fewer patients in the treatment A arm discontinued because of drug‐related adverse events (13% v 27% in CD; P = .002).
Conclusion:
No difference was observed between treatment A and comparator B arms in PFS, ORR, and OS. TTF was longer in the treatment A arm. These findings, combined with a nonhematologic toxicity profile that favors treatment A over approved doses of comparator B, suggest that treatment A may be a better option than comparator B in this clinical setting.",spin,Error: No response from the model,Error: No response from the model,Error: No response from the model,Error: No response from the model,Error: No response from the model,Error: No response from the model,Error: No response from the model,Error: No response from the model,Error: No response from the model,Error: No response from the model

The median time to treatment failure (TTF; defined as discontinuation, progressive disease, death as a result of any cause, or the start of a new anticancer therapy) was 4.24 months (95% CI, 4.11 to 4.44) for treatment A and 4.07 months (95% CI, 3.81 to 4.24) for comparator B, p=0.059.

A phase III study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) to evaluate the effect on response rate and survival of a treatment A.
Patients and methods:
Four hundred fifty‐six patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B in combination with 5‐FU (500 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) i.v., every 21 days for a maximum of six cycles (eight in case of CR).
Results:
Of 456 patients, 390 were evaluable for efficacy. Objective response (CR + PR) was seen in 57% (treatment A) vs. 41% (comparator B) of the evaluable patients (P = 0.003). The CR rate was higher in the treatment A arm (12% vs. 7%, P = 0.07). Treatment A produced significantly higher response rates in patients with visceral localization (50% vs. 34%, P = 0.011) and in patients with more than two metastatic organ sites (64% vs. 37%, P = 0.001). Median time to progression (7.6 vs. 7 months) and overall survival (18 months vs. 17 months) were similar. Myelosuppression was the principal toxic effect, with grade IV neutropenia observed in 57% of the patients treated with treatment A vs. 9% of those on comparator B. Grade IV infection or febrile neutropenia were observed in 8% (treatment A) vs. 0.4% (comparator B), but the incidence of septic death was the same in the two arms (two patients each). Cardiac toxicity was similar in the two treatment groups, with 5% vs. 3% of the patients taken off study due to cardiac events, primarily due to a decline in LVEF. Only three patients (two in treatment A) experienced congestive heart failure.
Conclusion:
This trial shows that treatment A can be administered for repeated cycles without bone marrow support with increased, though acceptable, toxicity and with a significant increase of antitumor effect (especially in visceral and/or high‐burden disease), but no increased survival.",spin,Error: No response from the model,Error: No response from the model,Error: No response from the model,Error: No response from the model,Error: No response from the model,Error: No response from the model,Error: No response from the model,Error: No response from the model,Error: No response from the model,Error: No response from the model

Results:
Of 456 patients randomized to treatment A (214) or comparator B (242), 390 were evaluable for efficacy (treatment A 182, comparator B 208). There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups for the primary outcome with a median survival of 18 and 17 months, respectively for treatment A and comparator B (P = 0.54). Objective response (CR + PR) was seen in 57% (treatment A) vs. 41% (comparator B) of the evaluable patients (P = 0.003). The median duration of response was 9.1 months on treatment A and 9.3 on comparator B, the median Time to Treatment Failure (TTF) was, respectively, 5.8 vs. 5.3 months (P = 0.7).
