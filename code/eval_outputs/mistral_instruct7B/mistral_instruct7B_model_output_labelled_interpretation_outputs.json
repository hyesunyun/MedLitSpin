        "abstract": "Background:\nTreatment A has been shown to inhibit breast carcinogenesis in preclinical studies. We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.\nMethods:\nWe randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30\u201070 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two\u2010sided.\nResults:\n2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66\u20101.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64\u20101.09; P = .177) between the two arms. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs (38 in the treatment A arm versus 40 in the control arm), incidence of distant metastasis (HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.79\u20101.22; P = .858), and all\u2010cause mortality (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.92\u20101.48; P = .215).\nConclusion:\nTreatment A was not more effective than no treatment in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:\nIt is uncertain whether treatment A provides additional benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. This trial was initiated to explore this question.\nPatients and methods:\nBetween January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front\u2010line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization. The two end points of interest for this study were time to treatment failure (TTF) and survival time.\nResults:\nMedian survival was 30.0 months for chemotherapy alone and 29.3 months treatment A and chemotherapy, p=0.834. Time to treatment failure (TTF) was 13.4 months for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with 10.3 month for chemotherapy alone patients (P = .087). The response rates (complete response and partial response) was 69.2% of for patients who received chemotherapy alone and 68.9% for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy, P =.99. There was no significant difference in toxicities seen between the two arms of the study. There were four lethal toxicities. Three infectious deaths occurred in patients receiving treatment A with chemotherapy.\nConclusion:\nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, treatment A with chemotherapy was not more effective than chemotherapy alone.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:\nIt is uncertain whether treatment A provides additional benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. This trial was initiated to explore this question.\nPatients and methods:\nBetween January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with estrogen receptor (ER)\u2010positive or ER\u2010unknown metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front\u2010line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization.\nResults:\nThe response rates (complete response and partial response) of patients who received chemotherapy alone and treatment A + chemotherapy were similar (69.2% v 68.9%, respectively; P =.99). Time to treatment failure (TTF) was slightly longer for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone patients (13.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.087), and TTF was significantly longer in ER\u2010positive compared with ER\u2010negative patients (17.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.048). However, ER status had no effect on overall survival (30.0 months for chemotherapy alone v 29.3 months for treatment A + chemotherapy).\nConclusion:\nIn patients with potentially hormone\u2010sensitive metastatic breast cancer, treatment A + chemotherapy prolongs TTF for ER\u2010positive patients without improving overall survival.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:\nEfficacy and safety of treatment A was compared with comparator B in a group of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, without previous systemic therapy for advanced breast cancer.\nMethods and materials:\nThe study was a prospective double\u2010blind randomized trial. All treated patients presented with positive estrogen receptors. Main end points were response rates, toxicity profile analysis, time to progression and survival. WHO and ECOG criteria were employed for response evaluation while toxicity was assessed according to WHO guidelines. Curves were constructed by means of Kaplan\u2010Meier methodology and were compared by means of log\u2010rank test.\nResults:\nFrom January 1996 to January 1999 a total of 217 patients were included in the study (106 in the treatment A and 111 in the comparator B). Both groups of patients were homogeneous regarding the main prognostic factors. A response rate of 64% (68/106) was observed in the treatment A group as compared with a 52% (58/111) in the comparator B group. Median times to progression and overall survival were not significantly different. A lower incidence of undesirable effects was appreciated in the treatment A arm.\nConclusion:\nOur data suggest that treatment A is an efficient and well\u2010tolerated agent for the therapy of postmenopausal women with hormonal positive receptors advanced breast cancer, and must be considered an alternative to comparator B as first line therapy for ER+ advanced breast cancer patients and as well as an adjuvant treatment.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:\nEfficacy and safety of treatment A was compared with comparator B in a group of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, without previous systemic therapy for advanced breast cancer.\nMethods and materials:\nThe study was a prospective double\u2010blind randomized trial. All treated patients presented with positive estrogen receptors. Main end points were response rates, toxicity profile analysis, time to progression and survival. WHO and ECOG criteria were employed for response evaluation while toxicity was assessed according to WHO guidelines. Curves were constructed by means of Kaplan\u2010Meier methodology and were compared by means of log\u2010rank test.\nResults:\nFrom January 1996 to January 1999 a total of 217 patients were included in the study (106 in the treatment A and 111 in the comparator B). Both groups of patients were homogeneous regarding the main prognostic factors. Response rates were not statistically different between the two therapeutic arms. A response rate of 64% (68/106) was observed in the treatment A group as compared with a 52% (58/111) in the comparator B group. Median times to progression (hazard ratios (HR) = 1.016; 95% CI 0.80\u20101.32; p=0.823) and overall survival (HR = 0.97 (95% CI 0.74\u20101.29; p=0.532) were not statistically significantly different. A lower incidence of undesirable effects was appreciated in the treatment A arm.\nConclusion:\nTreatment A was not more effective than comparator B in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "This study was designed to address whether treatment A with chemotherapy provides additional activity compared with chemotherapy alone in breast cancer patients with operable or locally advanced disease. Between January 1997 and January 2002, 211 consecutive patients with T2\u20104, N0\u20101, M0 breast cancer were randomized to receive either epirubicin alone (EPI) (n=105) or epirubicin plus treatment A (n=106). The primary outcome was the overall response rate. Overall, 198 patients received the planned chemotherapy dose (99 patients (94.2%) in the EPI arm and 99 patients (93.4%) in the EPI+treatment A arm). There was no statistically significant difference in overall response rate between the two treatment arms (76 versus 82% in the EPI and EPI+treatment A arms respectively). Pathological complete response was documented respectively in EPI and EPI+treatment A in 5 (4.8%) and 7 (6.7%) patients, and respectively 3 (2.9%) and 6 (5.7%) patients had carcinoma in situ. Toxicity did not differ from that expected with epirubicin. Leukopenia was the most relevant side effect, with about 50% of patients experiencing grade III\u2010IV toxicity in both arms. Platelet toxicity was uncommon and mild. Grade II\u2010III hemoglobin was observed in 15% of patients. Diarrhea and mucositis from mild to moderate occurred in 10% of patients. Acute cardiac toxicity was absent in both arms. All these side effects, attributable to epirubicin, were equally distributed in both arms. Treatment A with chemotherapy was not more effective than chemotherapy alone in breast cancer patients with operable or locally advanced disease.",

Between January 1997 and January 2002, 211 consecutive patients with T2\u20104, N0\u20101, M0 breast cancer were randomized to receive either epirubicin alone (EPI) or epirubicin plus treatment A. Ki67 expression was evaluated immunohistochemically in tumor specimens obtained before chemotherapy by incision biopsy and at definitive surgery. Tumor shrinkage of >50% was obtained in 76% of patients randomized in the EPI arm and 81.9% of patients randomized in the EPI+treatment A arm (not significant). The corresponding rates of clinical and pathological complete response were 20.2 and 21.9% (not significant), and 4.8 and 6.7% (not significant), respectively. Pathologically complete response was more frequently observed in estrogen receptor (ER)\u2010negative (ER\u2010) tumors (P=0.04) and correlated with elevated baseline Ki67 expression (P<0.01). Both EPI treatment and EPI+treatment A resulted in a significant reduction in Ki67 expression, either in overall patients (P=0.000) or in patients with ER+ breast cancer (P=0.000). The reduction in Ki67 immunostaining in the EPI+treatment A arm was greater than in the EPI arm, leading to a lower Ki67 expression at post\u2010operative residual histology (P=0.0041). The addition of treatment A to epirubicin chemotherapy did not improve the response rate but led to a significantly higher reduction in the Ki67 expression. Baseline elevated Ki67 expression and the ER\u2010 statuses were both associated with a greater chance of obtaining a pathological complete response at residual histology.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:\nTo determine whether treatment A, improves survival in patients with brain metastases when used as an adjunct to whole\u2010brain radiation therapy (WBRT).\nPatients and methods:\nPatients with brain metastases from solid tumors and a Karnofsky performance score of > or = 70 were randomly assigned to receive WBRT with supplemental oxygen and either treatment A (treatment A arm) or no treatment (control arm). The primary end point was survival.\nResults:\nThe study consisted of 515 eligible patients (treatment A arm, n = 265; control arm, n = 250). The median survival time (MST) was 5.4 months for the treatment A arm versus 4.4 months for the control arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87; P = .16). For the subgroup of patients with non\u2010small\u2010cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or breast cancer, the MST was 6.0 and 4.4 months, respectively (HR = 0.82; P = .07). Cox multiple regression analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of death for the treatment A arm in both primary populations. Further analysis indicated that the benefit may be restricted to the subgroup of patients with breast cancer. Response rates (radiographic complete response plus partial response) improved by 7% (P = .10) and 13% (P = .01) for all patients and for NSCLC and breast cancer patients in the treatment A arm, respectively. The most common severe adverse event in patients treated with treatment A was hypoxemia, which was reversible and effectively managed with supplemental oxygen in most patients.\nConclusion:\nThe addition of treatment A to WBRT may improve response rates and survival in patients with brain metastases, particularly metastases from breast cancer. A confirmatory trial for breast cancer patients has been initiated.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:\nTo determine whether treatment A, improves survival in patients with brain metastases when used as an adjunct to whole\u2010brain radiation therapy (WBRT).\nPatients and methods:\nPatients with brain metastases from solid tumors and a Karnofsky performance score of > or = 70 were randomly assigned to receive WBRT with supplemental oxygen and either treatment A (treatment A arm) or no treatment (control arm). The primary end point was survival.\nResults:\nThe study consisted of 515 eligible patients (treatment A arm, n = 265; control arm, n = 250). The median survival time (MST) was 5.4 months for the treatment A arm versus 4.4 months for the control arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87; P = .16). There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups for response rate (complete plus partial response) (46% for the treatment A arm and 38% for the control arm; P = .10). There was not a statistically significant difference in the cumulative incidence at 1 year after random assignment of radiographic (21% treatment A vs. 18% control; p=0.53) or clinical progression (49% treatment A vs. 51% control; p = 0.49) in the brain between the treatment groups. At 6 months, respectively 16% and 15% of the patients had a stable or improving quality of life in treatment A arm and control arm. The most common severe adverse event in patients treated with treatment A was hypoxemia.\nConclusion:\nThe addition of treatment A to WBRT was not more effective than WBRT alone in patients with brain metastases.",

Patients in Arm A received treatment A, with concomitant radiotherapy (50 Gy +/\u2010 10\u201020\u2010Gy boost). Patients in Arm B received comparator B, with subsequent radiotherapy.\nResults:\nMedian treatment durations were 64 and 126 days (Arms A and B, respectively), with no significant difference in overall or disease\u2010free survival. Five\u2010year locoregional relapse\u2010free survival favored patients with conservative surgery (two thirds of the population), with less local and / or regional recurrence in Arm A than in Arm B (3% vs. 9%; p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis in this subgroup showed a 2.8\u2010fold increased risk of locoregional recurrence with comparator B, independent of other prognostic factors (p = 0.027). Febrile neutropenia and Grade 3\u20104 leukopenia were significantly more frequent in Arm A. Subclinical left ventricular ejection fraction events at 1 year were more frequent with treatment A (p = 0.02).\nConclusion:\nTreatment A has significantly better locoregional control in node\u2010positive breast cancer after conservative surgery and 50% shorter treatment, albeit with slightly more acute toxicity.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:\nTo compare treatment A and comparator B in node\u2010positive, operable breast cancer patients.\nMethods and materials:\nThis was a randomized, multicenter, phase III trial enrolling 638 eligible women with prior breast surgery and positive axillary dissection. Patients in Arm A received treatment A, with concomitant radiotherapy (50 Gy +/\u2010 10\u201020\u2010Gy boost). Patients in Arm B received comparator B, with subsequent radiotherapy. The primary outcome was disease free survival.\nResults:\n650 women were enrolled in this trial, and a total of 638 patients were treated. Median treatment durations were 64 and 126 days (Arms A and B, respectively). Five\u2010year DFS in Arm A was 83% and in Arm B 79%, p = 0.22. Disease\u2010specific survival at 5 years was not statistically significantly different between Arm A and Arm B. Sixty\u2010eight patients died 34 in each group. There was no statistically significant difference at 5 years for regional or metastatic relapses. Local recurrences at 5 years was 3% in Arm A and 7% in Arm B, p=0.047). Febrile neutropenia (n=10 in arm A vs. n=1 in arm B) and Grade 3\u20104 leukopenia (n=43 vs n=4) were statistically significantly more frequent in Arm A. Subclinical left ventricular ejection fraction events at 1 year were more frequent with treatment A (p=0.02).\nConclusion:\nTreatment A was not more effective than comparator B in node\u2010positive, operable breast cancer patients.",

Patients were recruited from 13 colposcopy clinics in a variety of practice settings. 2299 women referred for the evaluation of an abnormal cervical cytology were randomized with stratification by cytology; subsequently 113 women were excluded for a variety of reasons. The main study outcomes were differences in true\u2010positive rates (CIN 2, 3 and cancer identified) and false\u2010positive rates between the study arms.\nResults:\nThe true\u2010positive (TP) rates were 14.4% vs. 11.4% (p=0.035, one\u2010sided) for the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm compared to colposcopy\u2010only arm, respectively, in women with either an atypical squamous cell (ASC) or low\u2010grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) cytology result. TP rates were similar between the two arms among women referred for the evaluation of HSIL (high\u2010grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). The 26.5% gain in true\u2010positives observed with the use of intervention A and colposcopy among women referred for an ASC or LSIL cytology was achieved with only a fractional increase in number of biopsies obtained per patient (0.30) and a modest increase in false\u2010positive rate\n(4%). In the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm among women with ASC or LSIL, the PPV (positive predictive value) of biopsies indicated by ntervention A was 15.0% and the PPV of biopsies indicated by colposcopy was 15.2%. Joint hypothesis testing indicates that intervention A and colposcopy provides benefit compared to colposcopy alone among women with ASC or LSIL.\nConclusion:\nCombining intervention A with colposcopy provides a clinically meaningful increase in the detection of CIN 2, 3 in women referred for the evaluation of mildly abnormal cytology results.",

Primary end point was overall response rate (ORR; partial or complete response). In total, 221 patients were assessable.\nResults:\nORR was 42.6% for CAF compared with 53.1% for treatment A + CAF, a 24.6% relative improvement and 10.5% absolute increase (P = .077). There was a trend for prolonged progression\u2010free survival (PFS; median 241 days for CAF v 366 days for treatment A + CAF; P = .145). In retrospectively defined subgroups, significant improvement in PFS in favor of treatment A was observed in patients who were premenopausal, had no prior therapy, and were stage IV at diagnosis with an intact primary tumor. Except for neutropenia and leukopenia, there was no statistically significant excess of grade 3/4 adverse events compared with CAF. Treatment with treatment A did not affect the plasma concentration of doxorubicin.\nConclusion:\nTreatment A + CAF was well tolerated and is suggested to have efficacy in patients who had not received prior therapy.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:\nIn 1996, we initiated the multicenter phase III randomized trial to compare the effect on disease\u2010free survival (DFS) of experimental treatment A versus comparator B after breast\u2010conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer. This report presents the clinical results with a median follow\u2010up of 60 months.\nPatients and methods:\nBetween February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery.\nResults:\nThere was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5\u2010year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence\u2010free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis\u2010free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76). Nevertheless, in the node\u2010positive subgroup, the 5\u2010year LRFS was statistically better in the treatment A arm (97% in treatment A v 91% in comparator B; P = .02), corresponding to a risk of locoregional recurrence decreased by 39% (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.93).\nConclusion:\nThis treatment protocol remains an appealing clinical option for many women with operable breast cancer at a high risk of recurrence. Combination treatments with new drugs for breast cancer are warranted.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:\nIn 1996, we initiated the multicenter phase III randomized trial to compare the effect on disease\u2010free survival (DFS) of experimental treatment A versus comparator B after breast\u2010conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer. This report presents the clinical results with a median follow\u2010up of 60 months.\nPatients and methods:\nBetween February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial (358 randomized to comparator B and 358 to treatment A) and respectively 343 and 352 patients were included in the analysis. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery. The primary endpoint was disease\u2010free survival (DFS) defined as the time from randomization to the first treatment failure (in the ipsilateral breast, in the axillary/infraclavicular/IMCs, or at a distant site) or death (if no recurrence had been noted).\nResults:\nThere was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5\u2010year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence\u2010free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis\u2010free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76).\nConclusion:\nTreatment A was not more effective than comparator B after breast\u2010conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer.",

The present work investigated whether and to what degree the short\u2010term advantages observed from treatment A were maintained at a longer follow\u2010up. Two hundred and eighty\u2010one patients with node\u2010negative and high TLI tumors were randomized to receive treatment A or no further treatment. Overall, at a median follow\u2010up of 12 years, 99 relapses have been observed, 55 in the control arm and 44 in the treatment A arm. At a median follow\u2010up of 12 years, there was no statistically significant difference between treatment A and no treatment for the cumulative incidence of relapse, Hazard Ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval] = 0.75 [0.50\u20101.13]; p= 0.17 and for the cumulative incidence of death HR = 0.80 [0.48\u20101.33], p= 0.38. The incidence of contralateral tumors was similar in the two arms (10 vs. 11). Treatment A was not more effective than no treatment on rapidly proliferating breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "The randomized multicenter study on rapidly proliferating breast cancer was activated at the end of the 1980s. The present work investigated whether and to what degree the short\u2010term advantages observed from treatment A were maintained at a longer follow\u2010up. Two hundred and eighty\u2010one patients with node\u2010negative and high TLI tumors were randomized to receive treatment A or no further treatment. At a median follow\u2010up of 12 years, treatment A produced a 25% and 20% relative reduction in relapse and death cumulative incidence, respectively. A breakdown analysis identified a subgroup of patients with intermediate proliferating tumors for whom a 70% and 73% reduction in relapse and death was observed in the intention\u2010to\u2010treat population. An even higher reduction of 80% and 84% in relapse and death was seen for the patients who had received the full treatment A dose. We identified a subgroup of patients with intermediate proliferating tumors in whom the high benefit obtained from treatment A was maintained at a long\u2010term follow up.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:\nTreatment A is effective against HER\u20102\u2010positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy of treatment A in HER\u20102\u2010negative and HER\u20102\u2010uncharacterized MBC.\nPatients and methods:\nWomen with MBC were randomly assigned to first\u2010line therapy with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks plus treatment A or placebo. A preplanned retrospective evaluation of HER\u20102 status was performed using fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP); secondary end points were objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), event\u2010free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS).\nResults:\nIn the intent\u2010to\u2010treat population (n = 579), there were no significant differences in TTP, EFS, or OS between treatment arms, although differences in ORR and CBR were noted. In 86 HER\u20102\u2010positive patients (15%), treatment with paclitaxel\u2010 treatment A resulted in statistically significant improvements in TTP, EFS, ORR, and CBR compared with paclitaxel\u2010placebo. No differences between treatment groups were observed for any end point in HER\u20102\u2010negative patients. The most common adverse events were alopecia, rash, and diarrhea. The incidence of diarrhea and rash was significantly higher in the paclitaxel\u2010treatment A arm. The rate of cardiac events was low, and no difference was observed between treatment arms.\nConclusion:\nPatients with HER\u20102\u2010negative or HER\u20102\u2010untested MBC did not benefit from the addition of treatment A to paclitaxel. However, first\u2010line therapy with paclitaxel\u2010 treatment A significantly improved clinical outcomes in HER\u20102\u2010positive patients. Prospective evaluation of the efficacy and safety of this combination is ongoing in early and metastatic HER\u20102\u2010positive breast cancer patients.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:\nThis phase III study compared the efficacy and safety of treatment A with comparator B in advanced breast cancer.\nPatients and methods:\nPatients were randomly assigned to treatment A or comparator B. Comparison of progression\u2010free survival (PFS) was the primary objective.\nResults:\nPatient characteristics were balanced between arms (N = 305). Median PFS was 8.05 months (95% CI, 6.60 to 8.71) for treatment A and 7.98 (95% CI, 6.93 to 8.77) for comparator B (log\u2010rank P = .121). Overall response rate (ORR) was 32% in both arms, and overall survival (OS) was not different between arms (P = .983). Time to treatment failure (TTF; defined as discontinuation, progressive disease, death as a result of any cause, or the start of a new anticancer therapy) was superior in the treatment A arm (P = .059). Hematologic toxicity was similar in both arms, except for grades 3 to 4 leukopenia (treatment A, 78%; comparator B, 66%; P = .025) and transfusions (treatment A, 17%; comparator B, 7%; P = .0051). Grades 3 to 4 diarrhea, mucositis, and hand\u2010and\u2010foot syndrome were significantly higher in the comparator B arm. Fewer patients in the treatment A arm discontinued because of drug\u2010related adverse events (13% v 27% in CD; P = .002).\nConclusion:\nNo difference was observed between treatment A and comparator B arms in PFS, ORR, and OS. TTF was longer in the treatment A arm. These findings, combined with a nonhematologic toxicity profile that favors treatment A over approved doses of comparator B, suggest that treatment A may be a better option than comparator B in this clinical setting.",

Primary outcomes were 7\u2010day point\u2010prevalence abstinence, biochemically confirmed, at the end of treatment (Week 12), and at 6 months post quit day (Week 27). Additional outcomes included: withdrawal, affect, quality of life, compliance, and side effects.\nResults:\nThere was no main effect of treatment A vs. placebo on abstinence (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.38\u20104.81, p =0.64). At week 12, the abstinence rates were 24.2% for placebo and 27.2% for treatment A; at week 27, the abstinence rates were 17.4% for placebo and 18.4% for treatment A. There was no statistically significant difference between placebo and treatment A in average daily smoking to week 12 (mean [SE] 5.2 [0.95] vs. 5.3 [1.0]; p=0.97); and to week 27 (mean [SE] 5.4 [0.88] vs. 6.1 [0.90]; p=0.64). There were no statistically significant difference between placebo and treatment A on changes in withdrawals (p=0.39); negative (p=0.41) and positive affect (p=0.77), and physical (p=0.31) and mental (p=0.42) quality of life.\nConclusion:\nTreatment A was not more effective than placebo on the prevalence of abstinence of cancer patients who continue to smoke postdiagnosis.",

        "journal": "Lancet",
        "abstract": "Background:\nWe aimed to compare overall survival in patients receiving treatment A or comparator B.\nMethods:\nThis was an open\u2010label randomized trial undertaken in 50 centres across eight countries. 1006 treatment\u2010naive patients diagnosed with advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma were randomly allocated (1 to 1) by minimization to receive comparator B or treatment A. Treatment was not masked. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Treatment groups were compared with a non\u2010stratified log\u2010 rank test. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN XXXX.\nFindings:\n502 patients were randomly assigned to receive comparator B and 504 to receive combined treatment A. Median follow\u2010up was 37.2 months (24.8\u201052.3). Median overall survival was 18.8 months (17.0\u201023.2) for patients receiving comparator B versus 18.6 months (16.5\u201020.6) for those receiving treatment A. Overall survival did not differ between the two groups (hazard ratio 1.05 [95% CI 0.90\u20101.21], p=0.55; absolute difference 0.3% (\u20105.1 to 5.6) at 1 year and 2.7% (\u20108.2 to 2.9) at 3 years). Serious adverse events were reported in 113 (23%) patients receiving comparator B and 131 (26%) of those receiving combined treatment A.\nInterpretation:\nAlthough treatment A does not improve overall or progression\u2010free survival compared with comparator B, treatment A might still have a role because it can produce remissions that are of clinically relevant length in some patients. Identification of patients who will benefit from treatment A is crucial.",

        "journal": "Lancet",
        "abstract": "Background:\nWe aimed to compare overall survival in patients receiving treatment A or comparator B.\nMethods:\nThis was an open\u2010label randomized trial undertaken in 50 centres across eight countries. 1006 treatment\u2010naive patients diagnosed with advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma were randomly allocated (1 to 1) by minimization to receive comparator B or treatment A. Treatment was not masked. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Treatment groups were compared with a non\u2010stratified log\u2010 rank test. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN XXXX.\nFindings:\n502 patients were randomly assigned to receive comparator B and 504 to receive combined treatment A. Median follow\u2010up was 37.2 months (24.8\u201052.3). Median overall survival was 18.8 months (17.0\u201023.2) for patients receiving comparator B versus 18.6 months (16.5\u201020.6) for those receiving treatment A. Overall survival did not differ between the two groups (hazard ratio 1.05 [95% CI 0.90\u20101.21], p=0.55; absolute difference 0.3% (\u20105.1 to 5.6) at 1 year and 2.7% (\u20108.2 to 2.9) at 3 years). There was no evidence that progression free survival differed statistically between treatment groups (HR 1.02 [0.89\u20131.16]; p=0.81). During treatment significantly more grade 3 and 4 toxic effects were associated with combined treatment A than with comparator B (269 patients [53%] vs. 183 patients [36%]; p<0.0001). Serious adverse events were reported in 113 (23%) patients receiving comparator B and 131 (26%) of those receiving combined treatment A.\nInterpretation:\nTreatment A was not more effective than comparator B on overall survival in patients diagnosed with advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma.",

The dose of melphalan was 0.25 mg/kg and prednisone was 100 mg given daily for 4 days every 6 weeks until plateau phase. A total of 357 patients were analyzed. Partial response was 34% and 33%, and very good partial response or better was 23% and 7% in the treatment A and placebo arms, respectively (P < .001). There was no significant difference in progression\u2010free or overall survival, with median survival being 29 months in the treatment A arm and 32 months in the placebo arm. Most quality of life outcomes improved equally in both arms, apart from constipation, which was markedly increased in the treatment A arm. Constipation, neuropathy, non\u2010neuropathy neurologic toxicity, and skin reactions were significantly more frequent in the treatment A arm. The number of thromboembolic events was equal in the 2 treatment arms. In conclusion, treatment A had a significant antimyeloma effect, but this did not translate into improved survival.",

        "abstract": "In this double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled study, 363 patients with untreated multiple myeloma were randomized to receive either melphalan\u2010prednisone and treatment A or melphalan\u2010prednisone and placebo. The dose of melphalan was 0.25 mg/kg and prednisone was 100 mg given daily for 4 days every 6 weeks until plateau phase. The primary outcome was overall survival. A total of 357 patients were analyzed. The median survival was 29 months (95% [CI], 25\u201038 months) in the treatment A arm and 32 months (95% [CI], 27\u201038 months) in the placebo arm; p=0.35. There was no statistically significant difference in progression free survival between the 2 arms with medians of 15 months 95% CI [12\u201019] for the treatment A arm and 14 months 95% CI [11\u201018] for the placebo arm. Partial response was 34% and 33%, and very good partial response or better was 23% and 7% in the treatment A and placebo arms, respectively (P < .001). Constipation, neuropathy, non\u2010neuropathy neurologic toxicity, and skin reactions were significantly more frequent in the treatment A arm. The number of thromboembolic events was 8% in both arms. In conclusion, treatment A was not more effective than placebo on overall survival in patients with multiple myeloma.",

        "abstract": "Background:\nCancer\u2010related fatigue is a debilitating symptom affecting psychosocial functioning and quality of life in 70% to 100% of cancer patients during and after treatment. The authors examined the effect of 200 mg of treatment A compared to placebo on the severity of cancer\u2010related fatigue.\nMethods:\nThe authors conducted a multicenter, randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010 controlled, phase 3, clinical trial to examine the effect of treatment A on patient\u2010 reported fatigue in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. A sample of 877 cancer patients beginning chemotherapy at 23 geographically separate University of Rochester Cancer Center (URCC) Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) affiliates were assessed for fatigue. Patients who reported fatigue (N = 867) were randomly assigned to receive either treatment A or a placebo. Treatment began on Day 5 of Cycle 2 and ended after Day 7 of Cycle 4. Fatigue, sleepiness and depression were assessed during Cycles 2 to 4 by using psychometrically valid measures. The primary outcome was the worst level of cancer related fatigue during the previous week at Cycle 4. Group differences (treatment vs. placebo) were examined by using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusting for baseline fatigue (Cycle 2).\nResults:\nThere were 631 patients (315 treatment A, 316 placebo) who provided evaluable data and were analyzed. There was no statistical significant difference for the worst level of cancer related fatigue between treatment A (mean (SE) = 6.87 (0.14) and placebo (mean (SE) = 7.09 (0.13); p = 0.08. Sleepiness was statistically significantly higher in placebo (mean (SE) = 18.38 (0.31) vs. treatment A (mean (SE) = 16.82 (0.26); p = 0.002. Treatment A had no statistically significant effect on depression (p=0.87)\nConclusion:\nTreatment A was not more effective than placebo in controlling cancer\u2010related fatigue.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:\nA two\u2010arm, double\u2010blind, randomized trial was performed to evaluate the effect of treatment A on acute skin\u2010related toxicity in patients undergoing breast or chest wall radiotherapy.\nMethods and material:\nPatients with ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast carcinoma who were undergoing external beam radiotherapy to the breast or chest wall were randomly assigned to apply treatment A or placebo cream daily. The primary study endpoint was the provider assessed maximal grade of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, radiation dermatitis.\nResults:\nA total of 176 patients were enrolled between September 21, 2007, and December 7, 2007. The provider assessed primary endpoint showed no difference in the mean maximum grade of radiation dermatitis by treatment arm (1.2+/\u20100.85 for treatment A vs. 1.3+/\u20100.80 for placebo; p = .18). Severe radiation dermatitis concerned 4 (5%) in both arms; p=.97. The worst grade of any type of toxicity were respectively in the placebo and treatment A groups 9% vs. 2% for grade 3 or 4: 24% vs. 30% for grade 2; 61% vs. 40% for grade 1; and 6% vs. 27% for grade 0; p = .04. For the patient\u2010reported outcome, the maximum Skindex\u201016 score for the treatment A group did not differ between the MMF arm (mean = 1.4) vs. placebo arm (mean = 1.7); p=0.07. The mean score for overall quality of life was 8.3 for treatment A vs. 8.4 for placebo; P> .05. The maximal Skin Toxicity Assessment Tool score was respectively in the treatment A and placebo group 1.5 vs. 2.1 for discomfort or burning (p=.02); 1.5 vs. 2.2 for itching (p = .002), 1.0 vs. 1.4 for pulling (p=.07) and 2.1 vs. 2.5 for discomfort or tenderness (p=.11).\nConclusion:\nTreatment A during radiotherapy was not more effective than placebo on acute skin related toxicity in patients undergoing breast or chest wall radiotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:\nA two\u2010arm, double\u2010blind, randomized trial was performed to evaluate the effect of treatment A on acute skin\u2010related toxicity in patients undergoing breast or chest wall radiotherapy.\nMethods and materials:\nPatients with ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast carcinoma who were undergoing external beam radiotherapy to the breast or chest wall were randomly assigned to apply treatment A or placebo cream daily. The primary study endpoint was the provider assessed maximal grade of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, radiation dermatitis. The secondary endpoints included provider\u2010assessed Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Grade 3 or greater radiation dermatitis and adverse event monitoring. The patient\u2010reported outcome measures included the Skindex\u201016, the Skin Toxicity Assessment Tool, a Symptom Experience Diary, and a quality\u2010of\u2010 life self\u2010assessment. An assessment was performed at baseline, weekly during radiotherapy, and for 2 weeks after radiotherapy.\nResults:\nA total of 176 patients were enrolled between September 21, 2007, and December 7, 2007. The provider assessed primary endpoint showed no difference in the mean maximum grade of radiation dermatitis by treatment arm (1.2 for treatment A vs. 1.3 for placebo; p = .18). Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events toxicity was greater in the placebo group (p = .04), primarily from pruritus. For the patient\u2010reported outcome measures, the maximum Skindex\u201016 score for the treatment A group showed less itching (p = .008), less irritation (p = .01), less symptom persistence or recurrence (p = .02), and less annoyance with skin problems (p = .04). The group\u2019s maximal Skin Toxicity Assessment Tool score showed less burning sensation (p = .02) and less itching (p = .002).\nConclusion:\nPatients receiving daily treatment A during radiotherapy might experience reduced acute skin toxicity compared with patients receiving placebo.",

        "abstract": "Objective:\nTo evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment A in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in platinum\u2010resistant ovarian cancer (OC).\nMethods:\nPatients with platinum\u2010refractory or \u2010resistant primary or secondary) OC were randomized to receive treatment A and PLD at 50 mg/m2 intravenously or PLD alone at 50 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 every 28 days until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression\u2010free survival (PFS). Other end points were objective response rate and safety. The study was originally planned for 244 patients. The trial was temporarily placed on hold after 125 patients were randomized while the results of another trial were being reviewed and the sponsor decided not to resume enrollment. The interim analysis became the final analysis.\nResults:\nThe median PFS was 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD (n = 65) versus 3.7 months for PLD (n = 60) (hazards ratio, 0.92; P = 0.7243). A preplanned subgroup analysis showed that 75 patients with platinum\u2010refractory or primary platinum\u2010resistant OC had a median PFS of 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD versus 2.9 months for PLD (hazards ratio, 0.55; P = 0.0425). Hematologic adverse events were 66% on the treatment A + PLD arm versus 44% on the PLD arm, manageable with dose reductions. Nonhematologic adverse events were similar for both arms. The incidence of palmar\u2010plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis was lower on treatment A + PLD (23%, 31%, respectively) versus (39%, 49%, respectively) on PLD.\nConclusion:\nOverall median PFS showed a positive trend but was not statistically significant. The median PFS in the platinum\u2010refractory and primary platinum\u2010resistant OC patients was significantly longer for treatment A + PLD versus PLD. Treatment A may ameliorate the palmar\u2010plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis known to be associated with PLD. Further study of this active well\u2010tolerated regimen in platinum\u2010refractory and primary platinum\u2010resistant OC is planned. This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov",

        "abstract": "Objective:\nTo evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment A in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in platinum\u2010resistant ovarian cancer (OC).\nMethods:\nPatients with platinum\u2010refractory or \u2010resistant primary or secondary) OC were randomized to receive treatment A and PLD at 50 mg/m2 intravenously or PLD alone at 50 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 every 28 days until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression\u2010free survival (PFS). Other end points were objective response rate, and safety. The study was originally planned for 244 patients. The trial was temporarily placed on hold after 125 patients were randomized while the results of another trial were being reviewed and the sponsor decided not to resume enrollment. The interim analysis became the final analysis.\nResults:\nThe median PFS was 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD (n = 65) versus 3.7 months for PLD (n = 60) (hazards ratio, 0.92; P = 0.7243). ORR was 12.3% for treatment A + PLD vs. 8.3% for PLD, p=0.5640. Hematologic adverse events were 66% on the treatment A + PLD arm versus 44% on the PLD arm with neutropenia 40.0% vs. 22.8%; thrombopenia 33.8% vs. 7.0%; febrile neutropenia10.8% vs. 3.5%. Nonhematologic adverse events were similar for both arms. The incidence of palmar\u2010plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis was lower on treatment A + PLD (23%, 31%, respectively) versus (39%, 49%, respectively) on PLD. The incidence of nausea and fatigue was higher in treatment A + PLD 60.0% vs. 49.1% and 43.1% vs. 36.8%).Thirteen deaths caused by serious adverse event were reported 7 with treatment A + PLD vs. 6 with PLD.\nConclusion:\nTreatment A in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin was not more effective than pegylated liposomal doxorubicin alone in patients with platinum\u2010 resistant ovarian cancer.

        "abstract": "Purpose:\nThis phase III trial assesses whether treatment A increases the duration of functional independence after surgery or radiosurgery of brain metastases.\nPatients and methods:\nPatients with one to three brain metastases of solid tumors (small\u2010cell lung cancer excluded) with stable systemic disease or asymptomatic primary tumors and WHO performance status (PS) of 0 to 2 were treated with complete surgery or radiosurgery and randomly assigned to treatment A or observation (OBS). The primary end point was time to WHO PS deterioration to more than 2.\nResults:\nOf 359 patients, 199 underwent radiosurgery, and 160 underwent surgery. In the radiosurgery group, 100 patients were allocated to OBS, and 99 were allocated to treatment A. After surgery, 79 patients were allocated to OBS, and 81 were allocated to treatment A. The median time to WHO PS more than 2 was 10.0 months (95% CI, 8.1 to 11.7 months) after OBS and 9.5 months (95% CI, 7.8 to 11.9 months) after treatment A (P = .71). Overall survival was similar in the treatment A and OBS arms (median, 10.9 v 10.7 months, respectively; P = .89). Treatment A reduced the 2\u2010year relapse rate both at initial sites (surgery: 59% to 27%, P < .001; radiosurgery: 31% to 19%, P = .040) and at new sites (surgery: 42% to 23%, P = .008; radiosurgery: 48% to 33%, P = .023). Salvage therapies were used more frequently after OBS than after treatment A. Intracranial progression caused death in 78 (44%) of 179 patients in the OBS arm and in 50 (28%) of 180 patients in the treatment A arm.\nConclusion:\nAfter radiosurgery or surgery of a limited number of brain metastases, treatment A reduces intracranial relapses and neurologic deaths but fails to improve the duration of functional independence and overall survival.",

        "journal": "J Clin Oncol",
        "abstract": "Purpose:\nWe examined the value of treatment A in a phase III trial with strict preoperative staging and surgical resection guidelines.\nPatients and methods:\nPatients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagogastric junction (AEG II and III) were randomly assigned to treatment A followed by surgery or to surgery alone. To detect with 80% power an improvement in median survival from 17 months with surgery alone to 24 months with treatment A, 282 events were required.\nResults:\nThis trial was stopped for poor accrual after 144 patients were randomly assigned (72:72); 52.8% patients had tumors located in the proximal third of the stomach, including AEG type II and III. The International Union against Cancer R0 resection rate was 81.9% after treatment A as compared with 66.7% with surgery alone (P = .036). The surgery\u2010only group had more lymph node metastases than the treatment A group (76.5% v 61.4%; P = .018). Postoperative complications were more frequent in the treatment A arm (27.1% v 16.2%; P = .09). After a median follow\u2010up of 4.4 years and 67 deaths, a survival benefit could not be shown (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.35; P = .466).\nConclusion:\nThis trial showed a significantly increased R0 resection rate but failed to demonstrate a survival benefit. Possible explanations are low statistical power, a high rate of proximal gastric cancer including AEG and/or a better outcome than expected after radical surgery alone due to the high quality of surgery with resections of regional lymph nodes outside the perigastic area (celiac trunc, hepatic ligament, lymph node at a. lienalis; D2).",

        "journal": "J Support Oncol",
        "abstract": "Sleep disorders are a substantial problem for cancer survivors, with prevalence estimates ranging from 23% to 61%. Although numerous prescription hypnotics are available, few are approved for long\u2010term use or have demonstrated benefit in this circumstance. Hypnotics may have unwanted side effects and are costly, and cancer survivors often wish to avoid prescription drugs. New options with limited side effects are needed. The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of treatment A for sleep in people with cancer who were undergoing cancer treatment. Participants were randomized to receive treatment A or placebo orally 1 hour before bedtime for 8 weeks. The primary end point was area under the curve (AUC) of the overall Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Secondary outcomes included the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Toxicity was evaluated with both self\u2010reported numeric analogue scale questions and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0. Questionnaires were completed at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks. A total of 227 patients were randomized into this study between March 19, 2004, and March 9, 2007, with 119 being evaluable for the primary end point. The AUC over the 8 weeks for treatment A was 51.4 (SD = 16), while that for placebo was 49.7 (SD = 15), with a P value of 0.6957. A supplemental, exploratory analysis revealed that several fatigue end points, as measured by the BFI and POMS, were significantly better for those taking treatment A over placebo. Participants also reported less trouble with sleep and less drowsiness on treatment A than placebo. There were no significant differences in toxicities as measured by self\u2010report or the CTCAE except for mild alkaline phosphatase increases, which were slightly more common in the placebo group. This study failed to provide data to support the hypothesis that treatment A, at bedtime could improve sleep as measured by the PSQI. However, exploratory analyses revealed improvement in some secondary outcomes, such as fatigue. Further research with treatment A exploring physiologic effects in oncology symptom management may be warranted.",

We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of a prechemotherapy education intervention (treatment A) to assess impact on patient distress, treatment\u2010related concerns, and the prevalence and severity of and bother caused by six chemotherapy side\u2010effects.\nPatients and methods:\nOne hundred and ninety\u2010two breast, gastrointestinal, and haematologic cancer patients were recruited before the trial closing prematurely (original target 352). Treatment A was administered before first treatment (intervention 1), 48 h after first treatment (intervention 2), and immediately before second treatment (intervention 3). Patient outcomes were measured at baseline (T1: pre\u2010education) and immediately preceding treatment cycles 1 (T2) and 3 (T3).\nResults:\nTreatment A did not significantly reduce patient distress. However, a significant decrease in sensory/psychological (P=0.027) and procedural (P=0.03) concerns, as well as prevalence and severity of and bother due to vomiting (all P=0.001), were observed at T3. In addition, subgroup analysis of patients with elevated distress at T1 indicated a significant decrease (P=0.035) at T2 but not at T3 (P=0.055) in treatment A patients.\nConclusion:\nTreatment A holds promise to improve patient treatment\u2010related concerns and some physical/psychological outcomes; however, further research is required on more diverse patient populations to ensure generalisability.",

A randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled phase II trial compared DP combined with either treatment A (A) or placebo in chemonaive mCRPC.\nPatients and methods:\nMen with progressive mCRPC despite androgen deprivation were eligible and randomized 1:1. Patients received docetaxel (75 mg/m2 day 1) and prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily every 21 days with either treatment A or placebo twice daily orally on days 1\u20103. The primary end point was overall survival (OS).\nResults:\nTwo hundred and twenty\u2010one patients were randomly assigned. Median OS for treatment A plus docetaxel\u2010prednisone (ADP) and placebo\u2010DP was 18.1 versus 17.8 months [hazard ratio (HR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.72\u20101.55, P=0.63]. Secondary end points were also not statistically different. Grade 3/4 toxic effects for ADP versus placebo\u2010DP were cardiac events (5% versus 2%), lymphopenia (23% versus 16%), neutropenia (47% versus 40%), ileus (2% versus 0%) and pulmonary embolism (6% versus 2%). In a subgroup of high\u2010risk mCRPC (n=34), outcomes appeared to favor ADP (median OS 19 versus 14 months).\nConclusion:\nTreatment A was tolerable but did not extend OS when combined with DP in mCRPC; a potential benefit was observed in high\u2010risk patients.",

        "abstract": "Background:\nTreatment A, has activity alone and in combination with docetaxel (Taxotere) and prednisone (DP) in metastatic castration\u2010resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). A randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled phase II trial compared DP combined with either treatment A (A) or placebo in chemonaive mCRPC.\nPatients and methods:\nMen with progressive mCRPC despite androgen deprivation were eligible and randomized 1:1. Patients received docetaxel (75 mg/m2 day 1) and prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily every 21 days with either treatment A or placebo twice daily orally on days 1\u20103. The primary end point was overall survival (OS).\nResults:\nTwo hundred and twenty\u2010one patients were randomly assigned. Median OS for treatment A plus docetaxel\u2010prednisone (ADP) and placebo\u2010DP was 18.1 versus 17.8 months [hazard ratio (HR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.72\u20101.55, P=0.63]. Secondary end points were also not statistically different. Grade 3/4 toxic effects for ADP versus placebo\u2010DP were cardiac events (5% versus 2%), lymphopenia (23% versus 16%), neutropenia (47% versus 40%), ileus (2% versus 0%) and pulmonary embolism (6% versus 2%). In a subgroup of high\u2010risk mCRPC (n=34), outcomes appeared to favor ADP (median OS 19 versus 14 months).\nConclusion:\nTreatment A was not more effective than placebo in metastatic castration\u2010 resistant prostate cancer patients.",

        "journal": "Ann Oncol",
        "abstract": "Purpose:\nA phase III study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) to evaluate the effect on response rate and survival of a treatment A.\nPatients and methods:\nFour hundred fifty\u2010six patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B in combination with 5\u2010FU (500 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) i.v., every 21 days for a maximum of six cycles (eight in case of CR).\nResults:\nOf 456 patients, 390 were evaluable for efficacy. Objective response (CR + PR) was seen in 57% (treatment A) vs. 41% (comparator B) of the evaluable patients (P = 0.003). The CR rate was higher in the treatment A arm (12% vs. 7%, P = 0.07). Treatment A produced significantly higher response rates in patients with visceral localization (50% vs. 34%, P = 0.011) and in patients with more than two metastatic organ sites (64% vs. 37%, P = 0.001). Median time to progression (7.6 vs. 7 months) and overall survival (18 months vs. 17 months) were similar. Myelosuppression was the principal toxic effect, with grade IV neutropenia observed in 57% of the patients treated with treatment A vs. 9% of those on comparator B. Grade IV infection or febrile neutropenia were observed in 8% (treatment A) vs. 0.4% (comparator B), but the incidence of septic death was the same in the two arms (two patients each). Cardiac toxicity was similar in the two treatment groups, with 5% vs. 3% of the patients taken off study due to cardiac events, primarily due to a decline in LVEF. Only three patients (two in treatment A) experienced congestive heart failure.\nConclusion:\nThis trial shows that treatment A can be administered for repeated cycles without bone marrow support with increased, though acceptable, toxicity and with a significant increase of antitumor effect (especially in visceral and/or high\u2010burden disease), but no increased survival.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:\nA phase III study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) to evaluate the effect on response rate and survival of a treatment A.\nPatients and methods:\nFour hundred fifty\u2010six patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B in combination with 5\u2010FU (500 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) i.v., every 21 days for a maximum of six cycles (eight in case of CR). The primary outcome was overall survival.\nResults:\nOf 456 patients randomized to treatment A (214) or comparator B (242), 390 were evaluable for efficacy (treatment A 182, comparator B 208). There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups for the primary outcome with a median survival of 18 and 17 months, respectively for treatment A and comparator B (P = 0.54). Objective response (CR + PR) was seen in 57% (treatment A) vs. 41% (comparator B) of the evaluable patients (P = 0.003). The median duration of response was 9.1 months on treatment A and 9.3 on comparator B, the median Time to Treatment Failure (TTF) was, respectively, 5.8 vs. 5.3 months (P = 0.7). Myelosuppression was the principal toxic effect, with grade IV neutropenia observed in 57% of the patients treated with treatment A vs. 9% of those on comparator B. Grade IV infection or febrile neutropenia were observed in 8% (treatment A) vs. 0.4% (comparator B), but the incidence of septic death was the same in the two arms (two patients each). Cardiac toxicity was similar in the two treatment groups, with 5% vs. 3% of the patients taken off study due to cardiac events, primarily due to a decline in LVEF. Three patients (two in treatment A) experienced congestive heart failure.\nConclusion:\nTreatment A was not more effective than comparator B in patients with metastatic breast cancer.",
