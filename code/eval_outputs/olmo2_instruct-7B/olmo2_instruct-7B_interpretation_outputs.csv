53,17264336,Phase III trial of concurrent or sequential adjuvant chemoradiotherapy after conservative surgery for early-stage breast cancer: final results of the ARCOSEIN trial,J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
In 1996, we initiated the multicenter phase III randomized trial to compare the effect on disease‐free survival (DFS) of experimental treatment A versus comparator B after breast‐conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer. This report presents the clinical results with a median follow‐up of 60 months.
Patients and methods:
Between February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery.
Results:
There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5‐year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis‐free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76). Nevertheless, in the node‐positive subgroup, the 5‐year LRFS was statistically better in the treatment A arm (97% in treatment A v 91% in comparator B; P = .02), corresponding to a risk of locoregional recurrence decreased by 39% (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.93).
Conclusion:
This treatment protocol remains an appealing clinical option for many women with operable breast cancer at a high risk of recurrence. Combination treatments with new drugs for breast cancer are warranted.",spin,7,"[{'token': '7', 'logits': [-0.5494999289512634, -0.017050934955477715], 'probability': [0.5772383809089661, 0.9830936193466187]}]",7,"[{'token': '7', 'logits': [-0.7058640718460083, -0.036283474415540695], 'probability': [0.49368178844451904, 0.9643669128417969]}]",8,"[{'token': '8', 'logits': [-0.578425407409668, -0.018939370289444923], 'probability': [0.5607806444168091, 0.981238842010498]}]",7,"[{'token': '7', 'logits': [-0.5272939801216125, -0.04428580030798912], 'probability': [0.590199887752533, 0.9566804766654968]}]",8,"[{'token': '8', 'logits': [-0.8002669811248779, -0.02713972143828869], 'probability': [0.4492090046405792, 0.9732251763343811]}]"

This report presents the clinical results with a median follow‐up of 60 months.
Patients and methods:
Between February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial (358 randomized to comparator B and 358 to treatment A) and respectively 343 and 352 patients were included in the analysis. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery. The primary endpoint was disease‐free survival (DFS) defined as the time from randomization to the first treatment failure (in the ipsilateral breast, in the axillary/infraclavicular/IMCs, or at a distant site) or death (if no recurrence had been noted).
Results:
There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5‐year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis‐free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76).

15,19273714,Phase III study of gemcitabine plus docetaxel compared with capecitabine plus docetaxel for anthracycline-pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer,J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
This phase III study compared the efficacy and safety of treatment A with comparator B in advanced breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
Patients were randomly assigned to treatment A or comparator B. Comparison of progression‐free survival (PFS) was the primary objective.
Results:
Patient characteristics were balanced between arms (N = 305). Median PFS was 8.05 months (95% CI, 6.60 to 8.71) for treatment A and 7.98 (95% CI, 6.93 to 8.77) for comparator B (log‐rank P = .121). Overall response rate (ORR) was 32% in both arms, and overall survival (OS) was not different between arms (P = .983). Time to treatment failure (TTF; defined as discontinuation, progressive disease, death as a result of any cause, or the start of a new anticancer therapy) was superior in the treatment A arm (P = .059). Hematologic toxicity was similar in both arms, except for grades 3 to 4 leukopenia (treatment A, 78%; comparator B, 66%; P = .025) and transfusions (treatment A, 17%; comparator B, 7%; P = .0051). Grades 3 to 4 diarrhea, mucositis, and hand‐and‐foot syndrome were significantly higher in the comparator B arm. Fewer patients in the treatment A arm discontinued because of drug‐related adverse events (13% v 27% in CD; P = .002).
Conclusion:
No difference was observed between treatment A and comparator B arms in PFS, ORR, and OS. TTF was longer in the treatment A arm. These findings, combined with a nonhematologic toxicity profile that favors treatment A over approved doses of comparator B, suggest that treatment A may be a better option than comparator B in this clinical setting.",spin,7,"[{'token': '7', 'logits': [-0.6830902099609375, -0.02720886468887329], 'probability': [0.5050538778305054, 0.9731580018997192]}]",7,"[{'token': '7', 'logits': [-0.7110209465026855, -0.03256411477923393], 'probability': [0.49114254117012024, 0.9679604172706604]}]",8,"[{'token': '8', 'logits': [-0.6639471650123596, -0.044688526540994644], 'probability': [0.5148152709007263, 0.9562953114509583]}]",7,"[{'token': '7', 'logits': [-0.49513763189315796, -0.025385508313775063], 'probability': [0.609486997127533, 0.974933922290802]}]",7,"[{'token': '7', 'logits': [-0.7810755372047424, -0.02972889319062233], 'probability': [0.45791324973106384, 0.9707086086273193]}]"

A phase III study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) to evaluate the effect on response rate and survival of a treatment A.
Patients and methods:
Four hundred fifty‐six patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B in combination with 5‐FU (500 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) i.v., every 21 days for a maximum of six cycles (eight in case of CR).
Results:
Of 456 patients, 390 were evaluable for efficacy. Objective response (CR + PR) was seen in 57% (treatment A) vs. 41% (comparator B) of the evaluable patients (P = 0.003). The CR rate was higher in the treatment A arm (12% vs. 7%, P = 0.07). Treatment A produced significantly higher response rates in patients with visceral localization (50% vs. 34%, P = 0.011) and in patients with more than two metastatic organ sites (64% vs. 37%, P = 0.001). Median time to progression (7.6 vs. 7 months) and overall survival (18 months vs. 17 months) were similar. Myelosuppression was the principal toxic effect, with grade IV neutropenia observed in 57% of the patients treated with treatment A vs. 9% of those on comparator B. Grade IV infection or febrile neutropenia were observed in 8% (treatment A) vs. 0.4% (comparator B), but the incidence of septic death was the same in the two arms (two patients each). Cardiac toxicity was similar in the two treatment groups, with 5% vs. 3% of the patients taken off study due to cardiac events, primarily due to a decline in LVEF. Only three patients (two in treatment A) experienced congestive heart failure.
Conclusion:
This trial shows that treatment A can be administered for repeated cycles without bone marrow support with increased, though acceptable, toxicity and with a significant increase of antitumor effect (especially in visceral and/or high‐burden disease), but no increased survival.",spin,7,"[{'token': '7', 'logits': [-0.6397894620895386, -0.022206341847777367], 'probability': [0.5274034738540649, 0.9780383706092834]}]",8,"[{'token': '8', 'logits': [-0.8164975047111511, -0.03846604749560356], 'probability': [0.44197696447372437, 0.962264358997345]}]",8,"[{'token': '8', 'logits': [-0.5523366928100586, -0.04603782296180725], 'probability': [0.5756032466888428, 0.9550058245658875]}]",7,"[{'token': '7', 'logits': [-0.6429378986358643, -0.0343702957034111], 'probability': [0.5257455110549927, 0.966213583946228]}]",8,"[{'token': '8', 'logits': [-0.6088788509368896, -0.03150658309459686], 'probability': [0.5439603924751282, 0.9689845442771912]}]"
