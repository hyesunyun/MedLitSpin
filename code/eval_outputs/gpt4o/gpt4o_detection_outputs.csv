54,17264336,Phase III trial of concurrent or sequential adjuvant chemoradiotherapy after conservative surgery for early-stage breast cancer: final results of the ARCOSEIN trial,J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
In 1996, we initiated the multicenter phase III randomized trial to compare the effect on disease‐free survival (DFS) of experimental treatment A versus comparator B after breast‐conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer. This report presents the clinical results with a median follow‐up of 60 months.
Patients and methods:
Between February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial (358 randomized to comparator B and 358 to treatment A) and respectively 343 and 352 patients were included in the analysis. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery. The primary endpoint was disease‐free survival (DFS) defined as the time from randomization to the first treatment failure (in the ipsilateral breast, in the axillary/infraclavicular/IMCs, or at a distant site) or death (if no recurrence had been noted).
Results:
There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5‐year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis‐free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76).
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than comparator B after breast‐conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer.",no_spin,no,"[{'token': 'No', 'bytes': [78, 111], 'logprob': -0.00091884314}, {'token': 'no', 'bytes': [110, 111], 'logprob': -7.000919}, {'token': '\n', 'bytes': [10], 'logprob': -12.250918}, {'token': 'Yes', 'bytes': [89, 101, 115], 'logprob': -13.750918}, {'token': ' no', 'bytes': [32, 110, 111], 'logprob': -14.000918}, {'token': '   ', 'bytes': [32, 32, 32], 'logprob': -15.250918}, {'token': '_no', 'bytes': [95, 110, 111], 'logprob': -15.500918}, {'token': ' No', 'bytes': [32, 78, 111], 'logprob': -16.75092}, {'token': '<|end|>', 'bytes': None, 'logprob': -17.75092}, {'token': 'NO', 'bytes': [78, 79], 'logprob': -18.00092}, {'token': '""No', 'bytes': [34, 78, 111], 'logprob': -18.12592}, {'token': '.no', 'bytes': [46, 110, 111], 'logprob': -18.25092}, {'token': '  ', 'bytes': [32, 32], 'logprob': -18.37592}, {'token': '\tno', 'bytes': [9, 110, 111], 'logprob': -18.37592}, {'token': ' ', 'bytes': [32], 'logprob': -18.50092}, {'token': 'The', 'bytes': [84, 104, 101], 'logprob': -18.50092}, {'token': '    ', 'bytes': [32, 32, 32, 32], 'logprob': -18.75092}, {'token': '\u200b\u200b', 'bytes': [226, 128, 139, 226, 128, 139], 'logprob': -19.25092}, {'token': '    \n', 'bytes': [32, 32, 32, 32, 10], 'logprob': -19.25092}, {'token': ':no', 'bytes': [58, 110, 111], 'logprob': -19.62592}]"
15,19273714,Phase III study of gemcitabine plus docetaxel compared with capecitabine plus docetaxel for anthracycline-pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer,J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
This phase III study compared the efficacy and safety of treatment A with comparator B in advanced breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
Patients were randomly assigned to treatment A or comparator B. Comparison of progression‐free survival (PFS) was the primary objective.
Results:
Patient characteristics were balanced between arms (N = 305). Median PFS was 8.05 months (95% CI, 6.60 to 8.71) for treatment A and 7.98 (95% CI, 6.93 to 8.77) for comparator B (log‐rank P = .121). Overall response rate (ORR) was 32% in both arms, and overall survival (OS) was not different between arms (P = .983). Time to treatment failure (TTF; defined as discontinuation, progressive disease, death as a result of any cause, or the start of a new anticancer therapy) was superior in the treatment A arm (P = .059). Hematologic toxicity was similar in both arms, except for grades 3 to 4 leukopenia (treatment A, 78%; comparator B, 66%; P = .025) and transfusions (treatment A, 17%; comparator B, 7%; P = .0051). Grades 3 to 4 diarrhea, mucositis, and hand‐and‐foot syndrome were significantly higher in the comparator B arm. Fewer patients in the treatment A arm discontinued because of drug‐related adverse events (13% v 27% in CD; P = .002).
Conclusion:
No difference was observed between treatment A and comparator B arms in PFS, ORR, and OS. TTF was longer in the treatment A arm. These findings, combined with a nonhematologic toxicity profile that favors treatment A over approved doses of comparator B, suggest that treatment A may be a better option than comparator B in this clinical setting.",spin,yes,"[{'token': 'Yes', 'bytes': [89, 101, 115], 'logprob': -0.014194305}, {'token': 'yes', 'bytes': [121, 101, 115], 'logprob': -4.2641945}, {'token': 'No', 'bytes': [78, 111], 'logprob': -11.1391945}, {'token': '\n', 'bytes': [10], 'logprob': -11.5141945}, {'token': ' yes', 'bytes': [32, 121, 101, 115], 'logprob': -12.1391945}, {'token': '_yes', 'bytes': [95, 121, 101, 115], 'logprob': -14.8891945}, {'token': '   ', 'bytes': [32, 32, 32], 'logprob': -15.3891945}, {'token': '<|end|>', 'bytes': None, 'logprob': -16.014194}, {'token': 'no', 'bytes': [110, 111], 'logprob': -16.514194}, {'token': 'YES', 'bytes': [89, 69, 83], 'logprob': -16.764194}, {'token': 'The', 'bytes': [84, 104, 101], 'logprob': -17.139194}, {'token': ' ', 'bytes': [32], 'logprob': -17.639194}, {'token': ' Yes', 'bytes': [32, 89, 101, 115], 'logprob': -17.639194}, {'token': '  ', 'bytes': [32, 32], 'logprob': -17.889194}, {'token': '“Yes', 'bytes': [226, 128, 156, 89, 101, 115], 'logprob': -19.014194}, {'token': 'This', 'bytes': [84, 104, 105, 115], 'logprob': -19.139194}, {'token': '\u200b\u200b', 'bytes': [226, 128, 139, 226, 128, 139], 'logprob': -19.264194}, {'token': '**', 'bytes': [42, 42], 'logprob': -19.764194}, {'token': '    ', 'bytes': [32, 32, 32, 32], 'logprob': -20.014194}, {'token': '     ', 'bytes': [32, 32, 32, 32, 32], 'logprob': -20.139194}]"
14,9093724,Doubling epirubicin dose intensity (100 mg/m2 versus 50 mg/m2) in the FEC regimen significantly increases response rates. An international randomised phase III study in metastatic breast cancer. The Epirubicin High Dose (HEPI 010) Study Group,Ann Oncol,"Purpose:
A phase III study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) to evaluate the effect on response rate and survival of a treatment A.
Patients and methods:
Four hundred fifty‐six patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B in combination with 5‐FU (500 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) i.v., every 21 days for a maximum of six cycles (eight in case of CR). The primary outcome was overall survival.
Results:
Of 456 patients randomized to treatment A (214) or comparator B (242), 390 were evaluable for efficacy (treatment A 182, comparator B 208). There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups for the primary outcome with a median survival of 18 and 17 months, respectively for treatment A and comparator B (P = 0.54). Objective response (CR + PR) was seen in 57% (treatment A) vs. 41% (comparator B) of the evaluable patients (P = 0.003). The median duration of response was 9.1 months on treatment A and 9.3 on comparator B, the median Time to Treatment Failure (TTF) was, respectively, 5.8 vs. 5.3 months (P = 0.7). Myelosuppression was the principal toxic effect, with grade IV neutropenia observed in 57% of the patients treated with treatment A vs. 9% of those on comparator B. Grade IV infection or febrile neutropenia were observed in 8% (treatment A) vs. 0.4% (comparator B), but the incidence of septic death was the same in the two arms (two patients each). Cardiac toxicity was similar in the two treatment groups, with 5% vs. 3% of the patients taken off study due to cardiac events, primarily due to a decline in LVEF. Three patients (two in treatment A) experienced congestive heart failure.
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than comparator B in patients with metastatic breast cancer.",no_spin,no,"[{'token': 'no', 'bytes': [110, 111], 'logprob': -0.57808}, {'token': 'No', 'bytes': [78, 111], 'logprob': -0.82808}, {'token': 'Yes', 'bytes': [89, 101, 115], 'logprob': -6.32808}, {'token': 'yes', 'bytes': [121, 101, 115], 'logprob': -8.07808}, {'token': '\n', 'bytes': [10], 'logprob': -10.57808}, {'token': '   ', 'bytes': [32, 32, 32], 'logprob': -11.57808}, {'token': ' no', 'bytes': [32, 110, 111], 'logprob': -11.95308}, {'token': '_no', 'bytes': [95, 110, 111], 'logprob': -14.45308}, {'token': '\tno', 'bytes': [9, 110, 111], 'logprob': -15.95308}, {'token': 'NO', 'bytes': [78, 79], 'logprob': -16.07808}, {'token': '    ', 'bytes': [32, 32, 32, 32], 'logprob': -16.45308}, {'token': '  ', 'bytes': [32, 32], 'logprob': -16.57808}, {'token': ' No', 'bytes': [32, 78, 111], 'logprob': -16.70308}, {'token': ' ', 'bytes': [32], 'logprob': -16.70308}, {'token': '.no', 'bytes': [46, 110, 111], 'logprob': -16.82808}, {'token': '<|end|>', 'bytes': None, 'logprob': -17.07808}, {'token': 'The', 'bytes': [84, 104, 101], 'logprob': -17.20308}, {'token': ' yes', 'bytes': [32, 121, 101, 115], 'logprob': -17.20308}, {'token': 'n', 'bytes': [110], 'logprob': -17.32808}, {'token': '    \n', 'bytes': [32, 32, 32, 32, 10], 'logprob': -18.20308}]"
