Randomized trial of fenretinide to prevent second breast malignancy in women with early breast cancer",J Natl Cancer Inst,"Background:
Treatment A has been shown to inhibit breast carcinogenesis in preclinical studies. We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.
Methods:
We randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30‐70 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66‐1.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64‐1.09; P = .177) between the two arms. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs (38 in the treatment A arm versus 40 in the control arm), incidence of distant metastasis (HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.79‐1.22; P = .858), and all‐cause mortality (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.92‐1.48; P = .215).
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than no treatment in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.",no_spin,no,"[{'token': 'No', 'bytes': [78, 111], 'logprob': -0.006762856}, {'token': 'no', 'bytes': [110, 111], 'logprob': -5.006763}, {'token': 'Yes', 'bytes': [89, 101, 115], 'logprob': -10.5067625}, {'token': '\n', 'bytes': [10], 'logprob': -11.0067625}, {'token': ' no', 'bytes': [32, 110, 111], 'logprob': -13.1317625}, {'token': '   ', 'bytes': [32, 32, 32], 'logprob': -14.2567625}, {'token': '_no', 'bytes': [95, 110, 111], 'logprob': -14.8817625}, {'token': '    \n', 'bytes': [32, 32, 32, 32, 10], 'logprob': -15.8817625}, {'token': 'The', 'bytes': [84, 104, 101], 'logprob': -16.006763}, {'token': 'yes', 'bytes': [121, 101, 115], 'logprob': -16.381763}, {'token': ' No', 'bytes': [32, 78, 111], 'logprob': -16.506763}, {'token': 'NO', 'bytes': [78, 79], 'logprob': -16.756763}, {'token': '.no', 'bytes': [46, 110, 111], 'logprob': -17.381763}, {'token': ' ', 'bytes': [32], 'logprob': -17.506763}, {'token': '    ', 'bytes': [32, 32, 32, 32], 'logprob': -17.756763}, {'token': '\tno', 'bytes': [9, 110, 111], 'logprob': -17.756763}, {'token': '   \n', 'bytes': [32, 32, 32, 10], 'logprob': -17.881763}, {'token': ':no', 'bytes': [58, 110, 111], 'logprob': -17.881763}, {'token': '<|end|>', 'bytes': None, 'logprob': -17.881763}, {'token': '  ', 'bytes': [32, 32], 'logprob': -18.131763}]"

Results:
At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (P =.642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (P =.177) between the two arms. However, an interaction was detected between treatment A and menopausal status in both outcomes (P for interaction in both outcomes =.045), with a possible beneficial effect in premenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66, and 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.41‐1.07; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 0.65, and 95% CI = 0.46‐0. 92) and an opposite effect in postmenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.32, and 95% CI = 0.82‐2.15; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.19, and 95% CI = 0.75‐1. 89).

It is uncertain whether treatment A provides additional benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. This trial was initiated to explore this question.
Patients and methods:
Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with estrogen receptor (ER)‐positive or ER‐unknown metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer.

Efficacy and safety of treatment A was compared with comparator B in a group of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, without previous systemic therapy for advanced breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
The study was a prospective double‐blind randomized trial. All treated patients presented with positive estrogen receptors. Main end points were response rates, toxicity profile analysis, time to progression and survival. WHO and ECOG criteria were employed for response evaluation while toxicity was assessed according to WHO guidelines. Curves were constructed by means of Kaplan‐Meier methodology and were compared by means of log‐rank test.
Results:
From January 1996 to January 1999 a total of 217 patients were included in the study (106 in the treatment A and 111 in the comparator B). Both groups of patients were homogeneous regarding the main prognostic factors. A response rate of 64% (68/106) was observed in the treatment A group as compared with a 52% (58/111) in the comparator B group. Median times to progression and overall survival were not significantly different. A lower incidence of undesirable effects was appreciated in the treatment A arm.

34,12177098,"Double-blind, randomized trial comparing the efficacy and tolerability of fulvestrant versus anastrozole in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer progressing on prior endocrine therapy: results of a North American trial",J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
To compare the efficacy and tolerability of treatment A with comparator B in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in patients whose disease progresses on prior endocrine treatment.
Patients and methods:
In this double‐blind, double‐dummy, parallel‐group study, postmenopausal patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP). Secondary end points included time to treatment failure (TTF), objective response (OR) rate, duration of response (DOR), and tolerability.
Results:
Patients (n = 400) were followed for a median period of 16.8 months. Treatment A was not more effective than comparator B in terms of TTP (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 1.14; P =.43); median TTP was 5.4 months with treatment A and 3.4 months with comparator B. There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups for TTF. Median TTF was 4.6 months for treatment A and 3.3 months for comparator B (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.19; P = .69). At the time of this data analysis, the rate of deaths was respectively for treatment A and comparator B, 35.4% (n=73) vs. 33.5% (n=65). OR rates were 17.5% with both treatments. DOR was statistically significantly greater for treatment A compared with comparator B; the ratio of average response durations was 1.35 (95% CI, 1.10 to 1.67; P < 0.01).

33,12177098,"Double-blind, randomized trial comparing the efficacy and tolerability of fulvestrant versus anastrozole in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer progressing on prior endocrine therapy: results of a North American trial",J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
To compare the efficacy and tolerability of treatment A with comparator B in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in patients whose disease progresses on prior endocrine treatment.
Patients and methods:
In this double‐blind, double‐dummy, parallel‐group study, postmenopausal patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP). Secondary end points included objective response (OR) rate, duration of response (DOR), and tolerability.
Results:
Patients (n = 400) were followed for a median period of 16.8 months. Treatment A was as effective as comparator B in terms of TTP (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 1.14; P =.43); median TTP was 5.4 months with treatment A and 3.4 months with comparator B. OR rates were 17.5% with both treatments. Clinical benefit rates (complete response + partial response + stable disease > or = 24 weeks) were 42.2% for treatment A and 36.1% for comparator B (95% CI, ‐4.00% to 16.41%; P =.26). In responding patients, median DOR (from randomization to progression) was 19.0 months for treatment A and 10.8 months for comparator B. Using all patients, DOR was significantly greater for treatment A compared with comparator B; the ratio of average response durations was 1.35 (95% CI, 1.10 to 1.67; P < 0.01). Both treatments were well tolerated.
Conclusion:
Treatment A was at least as effective as comparator B, with efficacy end points slightly favoring treatment A.

51,16314619,Phase III study of efaproxiral as an adjunct to whole-brain radiation therapy for brain metastases,J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
To determine whether treatment A, improves survival in patients with brain metastases when used as an adjunct to whole‐brain radiation therapy (WBRT).
Patients and methods:
Patients with brain metastases from solid tumors and a Karnofsky performance score of > or = 70 were randomly assigned to receive WBRT with supplemental oxygen and either treatment A (treatment A arm) or no treatment (control arm). The primary end point was survival.
Results:
The study consisted of 515 eligible patients (treatment A arm, n = 265; control arm, n = 250). The median survival time (MST) was 5.4 months for the treatment A arm versus 4.4 months for the control arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87; P = .16). For the subgroup of patients with non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or breast cancer, the MST was 6.0 and 4.4 months, respectively (HR = 0.82; P = .07). Cox multiple regression analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of death for the treatment A arm in both primary populations. Further analysis indicated that the benefit may be restricted to the subgroup of patients with breast cancer. Response rates (radiographic complete response plus partial response) improved by 7% (P = .10) and 13% (P = .01) for all patients and for NSCLC and breast cancer patients in the treatment A arm, respectively. The most common severe adverse event in patients treated with treatment A was hypoxemia, which was reversible and effectively managed with supplemental oxygen in most patients.

52,16314619,Phase III study of efaproxiral as an adjunct to whole-brain radiation therapy for brain metastases,J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
To determine whether treatment A, improves survival in patients with brain metastases when used as an adjunct to whole‐brain radiation therapy (WBRT).
Patients and methods:
Patients with brain metastases from solid tumors and a Karnofsky performance score of > or = 70 were randomly assigned to receive WBRT with supplemental oxygen and either treatment A (treatment A arm) or no treatment (control arm). The primary end point was survival.
Results:
The study consisted of 515 eligible patients (treatment A arm, n = 265; control arm, n = 250). The median survival time (MST) was 5.4 months for the treatment A arm versus 4.4 months for the control arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87; P = .16). There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups for response rate (complete plus partial response) (46% for the treatment A arm and 38% for the control arm; P = .10). There was not a statistically significant difference in the cumulative incidence at 1 year after random assignment of radiographic (21% treatment A vs. 18% control; p=0.53) or clinical progression (49% treatment A vs. 51% control; p = 0.49) in the brain between the treatment groups. At 6 months, respectively 16% and 15% of the patients had a stable or improving quality of life in treatment A arm and control arm. The most common severe adverse event in patients treated with treatment A was hypoxemia.

To compare treatment A and comparator B in node‐positive, operable breast cancer patients.
Methods and materials:
This was a randomized, multicenter, phase III trial enrolling 638 eligible women with prior breast surgery and positive axillary dissection. Patients in Arm A received treatment A, with concomitant radiotherapy (50 Gy +/‐ 10‐20‐Gy boost). Patients in Arm B received comparator B, with subsequent radiotherapy.
Results:
Median treatment durations were 64 and 126 days (Arms A and B, respectively), with no significant difference in overall or disease‐free survival. Five‐year locoregional relapse‐free survival favored patients with conservative surgery (two thirds of the population), with less local and / or regional recurrence in Arm A than in Arm B (3% vs. 9%; p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis in this subgroup showed a 2.8‐fold increased risk of locoregional recurrence with comparator B, independent of other prognostic factors (p = 0.027). Febrile neutropenia and Grade 3‐4 leukopenia were significantly more frequent in Arm A. Subclinical left ventricular ejection fraction events at 1 year were more frequent with treatment A (p = 0.02).

The contribution of treatment A in breast cancer patients after receiving adjuvant chemotherapy is not fully established. We investigated the impact of treatment A, given sequentially after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with operable breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
Between March 1991 and June 1999, 1863 women with stages I‐IIIA operable breast cancer who had undergone surgery and completed six cycles of adjuvant combination chemotherapy with either CMF, CAF, CEF, FAC or FEC were randomized to receive either treatment A for 3 years or no further treatment. Irrespective of menstrual status and hormone receptor content of the primary tumor, patients were stratified by institute, chemotherapy scheme and age (above 50 years or younger). The main end‐point was to detect a 5% increase in the 5 year survival (from 80% to 85%) in favor of treatment A. Secondary end‐ points were relapse free survival (RFS), local control, incidence of second primary breast cancer.
Results:
After exclusion of all patients from three sites because of inadequate documentation, a total of 1724 patients (93%) were analyzed (Treatment A 861 and Control 863). At a median follow‐up of 6.5 years, 396 deaths (23%) and 602 RFS events (35%) (relapse and/or death) have been observed.

1,17173959,Effective cervical neoplasia detection with a novel optical detection system: a randomized trial,Gynecol Oncol,"Objective:
To assess whether the use of intervention A as an adjunct to colposcopy increases the detection of biopsy confirmed CIN 2, 3 (high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia).
Methods:
This is a multicenter two‐arm randomized trial comparing colposcopy alone with colposcopy plus intervention A. Patients were recruited from 13 colposcopy clinics in a variety of practice settings. 2299 women referred for the evaluation of an abnormal cervical cytology were randomized with stratification by cytology; subsequently 113 women were excluded for a variety of reasons. The main study outcomes were differences in true‐positive rates (CIN 2, 3 and cancer identified) and false‐positive rates between the study arms.
Results:
The true‐positive (TP) rates were 14.4% vs. 11.4% (p=0.035, one‐sided) for the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm compared to colposcopy‐only arm, respectively, in women with either an atypical squamous cell (ASC) or low‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) cytology result. TP rates were similar between the two arms among women referred for the evaluation of HSIL (high‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). The 26.5% gain in true‐positives observed with the use of intervention A and colposcopy among women referred for an ASC or LSIL cytology was achieved with only a fractional increase in number of biopsies obtained per patient (0.30) and a modest increase in false‐positive rate
(4%). In the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm among women with ASC or LSIL, the PPV (positive predictive value) of biopsies indicated by ntervention A was 15.0% and the PPV of biopsies indicated by colposcopy was 15.2%.

2,17173959,Effective cervical neoplasia detection with a novel optical detection system: a randomized trial,Gynecol Oncol,"Objective:
To assess whether the use of intervention A as an adjunct to colposcopy increases the detection of biopsy confirmed CIN 2,3 (high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia).
Methods:
This is a multicenter two‐arm randomized trial comparing colposcopy alone with colposcopy plus intervention A. Patients were recruited from 13 colposcopy clinics in a variety of practice settings. 2299 women referred for the evaluation of an abnormal cervical cytology were randomized with stratification by cytology; subsequently 113 women were excluded for a variety of reasons. The main study outcomes were differences in true‐positive rates (biopsy confirmed CIN 2, 3 and cancer) and false‐positive rates (all women having at least one cervical biopsy taken with none of the biopies diagnosed as CIN 2,3, or cancer) between the study arms.
Results:
The final analyzed populations were 1096 in the colposcopy only arm and 1090 in the colposcopy plus intervention A arm. There was no statistically significant difference in the true positive rate between the 2 groups. The true positive rate was 19.9% (218/1096) in the colposcopy‐only arm vs 21.8% (238/1090) in the colposcopy plus intervention A arm; p=0.143. The false positive rate was 57.4% (629/1096) in the colposcopy‐only arm vs 60.5% (659/1090) in the colposcopy plus intervention A arm. No biopsy was performed in 239 (27.4%) in the colposcopy‐only arm and 193 (17.7%) in the colposcopy plus intervention A arm. The average number of biopsies was 1.03 for the colposcopy‐only arm and 1.30 for the colposcopy plus intervention A arm. Four subjects experienced minor adverse events during the study in both arms.

Combining intervention A with colposcopy was not more effective than colposcopy alone for the detection of CIN 2, 3 in women referred for the evaluation of mildly abnormal cytology results.",no_spin,no,"[{'token': 'no', 'bytes': [110, 111], 'logprob': -0.38691565}, {'token': 'No', 'bytes': [78, 111], 'logprob': -1.1369157}, {'token': 'Yes', 'bytes': [89, 101, 115], 'logprob': -10.886915}, {'token': '\n', 'bytes': [10], 'logprob': -11.386915}, {'token': '   ', 'bytes': [32, 32, 32], 'logprob': -12.136915}, {'token': ' no', 'bytes': [32, 110, 111], 'logprob': -12.136915}, {'token': 'yes', 'bytes': [121, 101, 115], 'logprob': -12.636915}, {'token': '_no', 'bytes': [95, 110, 111], 'logprob': -15.136915}, {'token': '    ', 'bytes': [32, 32, 32, 32], 'logprob': -16.761915}, {'token': '\tno', 'bytes': [9, 110, 111], 'logprob': -16.886915}, {'token': '.no', 'bytes': [46, 110, 111], 'logprob': -17.261915}, {'token': 'NO', 'bytes': [78, 79], 'logprob': -17.261915}, {'token': '  ', 'bytes': [32, 32], 'logprob': -17.386915}, {'token': '    \n', 'bytes': [32, 32, 32, 32, 10], 'logprob': -17.386915}, {'token': ' ', 'bytes': [32], 'logprob': -17.761915}, {'token': ' No', 'bytes': [32, 78, 111], 'logprob': -18.136915}, {'token': '<|end|>', 'bytes': None, 'logprob': -18.136915}, {'token': ':no', 'bytes': [58, 110, 111], 'logprob': -18.511915}, {'token': 'The', 'bytes': [84, 104, 101], 'logprob': -18.511915}, {'token': 'n', 'bytes': [110], 'logprob': -18.886915}]"

In 1996, we initiated the multicenter phase III randomized trial to compare the effect on disease‐free survival (DFS) of experimental treatment A versus comparator B after breast‐conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer. This report presents the clinical results with a median follow‐up of 60 months.
Patients and methods:
Between February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery.
Results:
There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5‐year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis‐free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76). Nevertheless, in the node‐positive subgroup, the 5‐year LRFS was statistically better in the treatment A arm (97% in treatment A v 91% in comparator B; P = .02), corresponding to a risk of locoregional recurrence decreased by 39% (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.93).

This phase III randomized open‐label clinical trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment A versus comparator B as first‐line treatment for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in postmenopausal women.
Patients and methods:
The study was conducted at 81 centers and enrolled postmenopausal patients with measurable hormone‐sensitive metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer. Prior adjuvant chemotherapy and/or comparator B were allowed. One previous chemotherapy regimen and no prior hormone therapy for advanced disease were permitted. Patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment A or comparator B until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. Progression‐free survival (PFS) as the primary study end point.
Results:
Of the 382 patients randomized at 79 sites, 371 (182 treatment A, 189 comparator B) were included in the analysis. No treatment related death were observed. A total of 319 events (progression or death) were observed: 161 (85%) in the comparator B arm and 158 (87%) in the treatment A arm. Median progression‐ free survival (PFS) (primary outcome) was 5.8 months with comparator B (95% CI, 5.3 to 8.1 months) vs 9.9 months; (95% CI, 8.7 to 11.8 months) with treatment A, HR = 0.84 (95% CI, 0.67 to 1.05), p = .121.

Treatment A is effective against HER‐2‐positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy of treatment A in HER‐2‐negative and HER‐2‐uncharacterized MBC.
Patients and methods:
Women with MBC were randomly assigned to first‐line therapy with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks plus treatment A or placebo. A preplanned retrospective evaluation of HER‐2 status was performed using fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP); secondary end points were objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), event‐free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS).
Results:
In the intent‐to‐treat population (n = 579), there were no significant differences in TTP, EFS, or OS between treatment arms, although differences in ORR and CBR were noted. In 86 HER‐2‐positive patients (15%), treatment with paclitaxel‐ treatment A resulted in statistically significant improvements in TTP, EFS, ORR, and CBR compared with paclitaxel‐placebo. No differences between treatment groups were observed for any end point in HER‐2‐negative patients. The most common adverse events were alopecia, rash, and diarrhea. The incidence of diarrhea and rash was significantly higher in the paclitaxel‐treatment A arm. The rate of cardiac events was low, and no difference was observed between treatment arms.
Conclusion:
Patients with HER‐2‐negative or HER‐2‐untested MBC did not benefit from the addition of treatment A to paclitaxel.

This phase III study compared the efficacy and safety of treatment A with comparator B in advanced breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
Patients were randomly assigned to treatment A or comparator B. Comparison of progression‐free survival (PFS) was the primary objective.
Results:
Patient characteristics were balanced between arms (N = 305). Median PFS was 8.05 months (95% CI, 6.60 to 8.71) for treatment A and 7.98 (95% CI, 6.93 to 8.77) for comparator B (log‐rank P = .121).

42,20087643,A bupropion smoking cessation clinical trial for cancer patients,Cancer Causes Control,"Objective:
Many cancer patients continue to smoke postdiagnosis, yet there have been few smoking cessation trials for this population.
Methods:
This double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial randomized 246 cancer patients to 9 weeks of placebo or treatment A, stratifying by pre‐treatment depression symptoms. In addition, all patients received transdermal nicotine and behavioral counseling. Primary outcomes were 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence, biochemically confirmed, at the end of treatment (Week 12), and at 6 months post quit day (Week 27). Additional outcomes included: withdrawal, affect, quality of life, compliance, and side effects.
Results:
There was no main effect of treatment A vs. placebo on abstinence (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.38‐4.81, p =0.64). At week 12, the abstinence rates were 24.2% for placebo and 27.2% for treatment A; at week 27, the abstinence rates were 17.4% for placebo and 18.4% for treatment A.

41,20087643,A bupropion smoking cessation clinical trial for cancer patients,Cancer Causes Control,"Objective:
Many cancer patients continue to smoke postdiagnosis, yet there have been few smoking cessation trials for this population. Depression, which is prevalent among cancer patients, may be a barrier to cessation.
Methods:
This double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial randomized 246 cancer patients to 9 weeks of placebo or treatment A, stratifying by pre‐treatment depression symptoms. In addition, all patients received transdermal nicotine and behavioral counseling. Primary outcomes were 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence, biochemically confirmed, at the end of treatment (Week 12), and at 6 months post quit day (Week 27).

Results:
There was no main effect of treatment A vs. placebo on abstinence (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.38‐4.81, p = 0.64). Patients with depression symptoms reported significantly lower abstinence rates vs. patients without depression symptoms (OR = .14, 95% CI: 0.02‐0.80, p=0.03). Treatment A increased abstinence rates, vs. placebo, more for participants with depression vs. those without depression symptoms. For patients with depression symptoms, treatment A reduced withdrawal symptoms and improved quality of life vs. placebo.
Conclusion:
For patients with depression symptoms, treatment increases abstinence rates, lowers withdrawal, and increases quality of life. However, abstinence rates among patients with depression symptoms were low vs. patients without depression symptoms, who exhibited similar abstinence rates when treated with treatment A or transdermal nicotine and counseling alone.

We aimed to compare overall survival in patients receiving treatment A or comparator B.
Methods:
This was an open‐label randomized trial undertaken in 50 centres across eight countries. 1006 treatment‐naive patients diagnosed with advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma were randomly allocated (1 to 1) by minimization to receive comparator B or treatment A. Treatment was not masked. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Treatment groups were compared with a non‐stratified log‐ rank test. Analysis was by intention to treat.

Findings:
502 patients were randomly assigned to receive comparator B and 504 to receive combined treatment A. Median follow‐up was 37.2 months (24.8‐52.3).

Patients and methods:
A total of 1,221 patients with MBC previously treated with anthracycline and taxanes were randomly assigned to treatment A or comparator B (2,500 mg/m2 on the same schedule) given every 21 days. The trial was powered to detect a 20% reduction in the hazard ratio (HR) for death.
Results:
There was no significant difference in OS between the treatment A and comparator B arm, the primary end point (median, 16.4 v 15.6 months; HR = 0.9; 95% CI, 078 to 1.03; P = .1162). The arms were well balanced with the exception of a higher prevalence of impaired performance status (Karnofsky performance status 70% to 80%) in the treatment A arm (32% v 25%). Grade 3 to 4 neuropathy occurred in 24% treated with the treatment A compared to 1.2% treated with comparator B. The median time to improvement of grade 3 or worse treatment related neuropathy by at least one grade was 4.5 weeks. Grade 3‐4 neutropenia and grade 3‐4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 73% and 7% treated with the treatment A versus 9% and 0.6% treated with comparator B. Grade 3‐4 fatigue occurred in 12% treated with the treatment A versus 3% treated with comparator B.
Conclusion:
The treatment A was not more effective than comparator B on overall survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer previously treated with anthracycline and taxanes.",no_spin,no,"[{'token': 'No', 'bytes': [78, 111], 'logprob': -0.0058707213}, {'token': 'Yes', 'bytes': [89, 101, 115], 'logprob': -5.255871}, {'token': 'no', 'bytes': [110, 111], 'logprob': -7.380871}, {'token': '\n', 'bytes': [10], 'logprob': -12.255871}, {'token': ' no', 'bytes': [32, 110, 111], 'logprob': -12.755871}, {'token': 'yes', 'bytes': [121, 101, 115], 'logprob': -12.880871}, {'token': '_no', 'bytes': [95, 110, 111], 'logprob': -13.505871}, {'token': ' No', 'bytes': [32, 78, 111], 'logprob': -14.380871}, {'token': 'NO', 'bytes': [78, 79], 'logprob': -14.755871}, {'token': '""No', 'bytes': [34, 78, 111], 'logprob': -15.130871}, {'token': '<|end|>', 'bytes': None, 'logprob': -15.755871}, {'token': '.no', 'bytes': [46, 110, 111], 'logprob': -15.880871}, {'token': '\tno', 'bytes': [9, 110, 111], 'logprob': -16.00587}, {'token': '   ', 'bytes': [32, 32, 32], 'logprob': -16.25587}, {'token': '_No', 'bytes': [95, 78, 111], 'logprob': -16.88087}, {'token': '\u200b\u200b', 'bytes': [226, 128, 139, 226, 128, 139], 'logprob': -17.00587}, {'token': '\u200b', 'bytes': [226, 128, 139], 'logprob': -17.38087}, {'token': ' yes', 'bytes': [32, 121, 101, 115], 'logprob': -17.38087}, {'token': ':no', 'bytes': [58, 110, 111], 'logprob': -17.38087}, {'token': '-no', 'bytes': [45, 110, 111], 'logprob': -17.50587}]"

Cancer‐related fatigue is a debilitating symptom affecting psychosocial functioning and quality of life in 70% to 100% of cancer patients during and after treatment. The authors examined the effect of 200 mg of treatment A compared to placebo on the severity of cancer‐related fatigue.
Methods:
The authors conducted a multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐ controlled, phase 3, clinical trial to examine the effect of treatment A on patient‐ reported fatigue in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. A sample of 877 cancer patients beginning chemotherapy at 23 geographically separate University of Rochester Cancer Center (URCC) Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) affiliates were assessed for fatigue. Patients who reported fatigue (N = 867) were randomly assigned to receive either treatment A or a placebo. Treatment began on Day 5 of Cycle 2 and ended after Day 7 of Cycle 4. Fatigue, sleepiness and depression were assessed during Cycles 2 to 4 by using psychometrically valid measures. The primary outcome was the worst level of cancer related fatigue during the previous week at Cycle 4. Group differences (treatment vs. placebo) were examined by using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusting for baseline fatigue (Cycle 2).
Results:
There were 631 patients (315 treatment A, 316 placebo) who provided evaluable data and were analyzed. There was no statistical significant difference for the worst level of cancer related fatigue between treatment A (mean (SE) = 6.87 (0.14) and placebo (mean (SE) = 7.09 (0.13); p = 0.08.

30,20800381,"Mometasone furoate effect on acute skin toxicity in breast cancer patients receiving radiotherapy: a phase III double-blind, randomized trial from the North Central Cancer Treatment Group N06C4",Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"Purpose:
A two‐arm, double‐blind, randomized trial was performed to evaluate the effect of treatment A on acute skin‐related toxicity in patients undergoing breast or chest wall radiotherapy.
Methods and material:
Patients with ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast carcinoma who were undergoing external beam radiotherapy to the breast or chest wall were randomly assigned to apply treatment A or placebo cream daily. The primary study endpoint was the provider assessed maximal grade of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, radiation dermatitis.
Results:
A total of 176 patients were enrolled between September 21, 2007, and December 7, 2007. The provider assessed primary endpoint showed no difference in the mean maximum grade of radiation dermatitis by treatment arm (1.2+/‐0.85 for treatment A vs. 1.3+/‐0.80 for placebo; p = .18). Severe radiation dermatitis concerned 4 (5%) in both arms; p=.97. The worst grade of any type of toxicity were respectively in the placebo and treatment A groups 9% vs. 2% for grade 3 or 4: 24% vs. 30% for grade 2; 61% vs. 40% for grade 1; and 6% vs. 27% for grade 0; p = .04. For the patient‐reported outcome, the maximum Skindex‐16 score for the treatment A group did not differ between the MMF arm (mean = 1.4) vs. placebo arm (mean = 1.7); p=0.07. The mean score for overall quality of life was 8.3 for treatment A vs. 8.4 for placebo; P> .05.

29,20800381,"Mometasone furoate effect on acute skin toxicity in breast cancer patients receiving radiotherapy: a phase III double-blind, randomized trial from the North Central Cancer Treatment Group N06C4",Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"Purpose:
A two‐arm, double‐blind, randomized trial was performed to evaluate the effect of treatment A on acute skin‐related toxicity in patients undergoing breast or chest wall radiotherapy.
Methods and materials:
Patients with ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast carcinoma who were undergoing external beam radiotherapy to the breast or chest wall were randomly assigned to apply treatment A or placebo cream daily. The primary study endpoint was the provider assessed maximal grade of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, radiation dermatitis. The secondary endpoints included provider‐assessed Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Grade 3 or greater radiation dermatitis and adverse event monitoring. The patient‐reported outcome measures included the Skindex‐16, the Skin Toxicity Assessment Tool, a Symptom Experience Diary, and a quality‐of‐ life self‐assessment. An assessment was performed at baseline, weekly during radiotherapy, and for 2 weeks after radiotherapy.
Results:
A total of 176 patients were enrolled between September 21, 2007, and December 7, 2007. The provider assessed primary endpoint showed no difference in the mean maximum grade of radiation dermatitis by treatment arm (1.2 for treatment A vs. 1.3 for placebo; p = .18). Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events toxicity was greater in the placebo group (p = .04), primarily from pruritus. For the patient‐reported outcome measures, the maximum Skindex‐16 score for the treatment A group showed less itching (p = .008), less irritation (p = .01), less symptom persistence or recurrence (p = .02), and less annoyance with skin problems (p = .04). The group’s maximal Skin Toxicity Assessment Tool score showed less burning sensation (p = .02) and less itching (p = .002).

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment A in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer (OC).
Methods:
Patients with platinum‐refractory or ‐resistant primary or secondary) OC were randomized to receive treatment A and PLD at 50 mg/m2 intravenously or PLD alone at 50 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 every 28 days until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression‐free survival (PFS). Other end points were objective response rate and safety. The study was originally planned for 244 patients. The trial was temporarily placed on hold after 125 patients were randomized while the results of another trial were being reviewed and the sponsor decided not to resume enrollment. The interim analysis became the final analysis.
Results:
The median PFS was 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD (n = 65) versus 3.7 months for PLD (n = 60) (hazards ratio, 0.92; P = 0.7243). A preplanned subgroup analysis showed that 75 patients with platinum‐refractory or primary platinum‐resistant OC had a median PFS of 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD versus 2.9 months for PLD (hazards ratio, 0.55; P = 0.0425). Hematologic adverse events were 66% on the treatment A + PLD arm versus 44% on the PLD arm, manageable with dose reductions. Nonhematologic adverse events were similar for both arms. The incidence of palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis was lower on treatment A + PLD (23%, 31%, respectively) versus (39%, 49%, respectively) on PLD.
Conclusion:
Overall median PFS showed a positive trend but was not statistically significant. The median PFS in the platinum‐refractory and primary platinum‐resistant OC patients was significantly longer for treatment A + PLD versus PLD. Treatment A may ameliorate the palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis known to be associated with PLD.

This phase III trial assesses whether treatment A increases the duration of functional independence after surgery or radiosurgery of brain metastases.
Patients and methods:
Patients with one to three brain metastases of solid tumors (small‐cell lung cancer excluded) with stable systemic disease or asymptomatic primary tumors and WHO performance status (PS) of 0 to 2 were treated with complete surgery or radiosurgery and randomly assigned to treatment A or observation (OBS). The primary end point was time to WHO PS deterioration to more than 2.
Results:
Of 359 patients, 199 underwent radiosurgery, and 160 underwent surgery. In the radiosurgery group, 100 patients were allocated to OBS, and 99 were allocated to treatment A. After surgery, 79 patients were allocated to OBS, and 81 were allocated to treatment A.

We examined the value of treatment A in a phase III trial with strict preoperative staging and surgical resection guidelines.
Patients and methods:
Patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagogastric junction (AEG II and III) were randomly assigned to treatment A followed by surgery or to surgery alone. To detect with 80% power an improvement in median survival from 17 months with surgery alone to 24 months with treatment A, 282 events were required.
Results:
This trial was stopped for poor accrual after 144 patients were randomly assigned (72:72); 52.8% patients had tumors located in the proximal third of the stomach, including AEG type II and III. The International Union against Cancer R0 resection rate was 81.9% after treatment A as compared with 66.7% with surgery alone (P = .036). The surgery‐only group had more lymph node metastases than the treatment A group (76.5% v 61.4%; P = .018). Postoperative complications were more frequent in the treatment A arm (27.1% v 16.2%; P = .09).

Possible explanations are low statistical power, a high rate of proximal gastric cancer including AEG and/or a better outcome than expected after radical surgery alone due to the high quality of surgery with resections of regional lymph nodes outside the perigastic area (celiac trunc, hepatic ligament, lymph node at a. lienalis; D2).",spin,yes,"[{'token': 'yes', 'bytes': [121, 101, 115], 'logprob': -0.40275693}, {'token': 'no', 'bytes': [110, 111], 'logprob': -1.1527569}, {'token': 'Yes', 'bytes': [89, 101, 115], 'logprob': -4.4027567}, {'token': 'No', 'bytes': [78, 111], 'logprob': -5.6527567}, {'token': '\n', 'bytes': [10], 'logprob': -12.527757}, {'token': ' yes', 'bytes': [32, 121, 101, 115], 'logprob': -12.652757}, {'token': '   ', 'bytes': [32, 32, 32], 'logprob': -13.777757}, {'token': ' no', 'bytes': [32, 110, 111], 'logprob': -14.027757}, {'token': '_no', 'bytes': [95, 110, 111], 'logprob': -16.527758}, {'token': '_yes', 'bytes': [95, 121, 101, 115], 'logprob': -16.652758}, {'token': 'The', 'bytes': [84, 104, 101], 'logprob': -17.277758}, {'token': ' ', 'bytes': [32], 'logprob': -17.277758}, {'token': 'n', 'bytes': [110], 'logprob': -18.027758}, {'token': '  ', 'bytes': [32, 32], 'logprob': -18.152758}, {'token': '<|end|>', 'bytes': None, 'logprob': -18.277758}, {'token': 'NO', 'bytes': [78, 79], 'logprob': -18.402758}, {'token': '    ', 'bytes': [32, 32, 32, 32], 'logprob': -18.402758}, {'token': '\tno', 'bytes': [9, 110, 111], 'logprob': -18.402758}, {'token': 'YES', 'bytes': [89, 69, 83], 'logprob': -18.902758}, {'token': '\u200b\u200b', 'bytes': [226, 128, 139, 226, 128, 139], 'logprob': -18.902758}]"
44,21060024,Neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with surgery alone for locally advanced cancer of the stomach and cardia: European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer randomized trial 40954,J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
We examined the value of treatment A in a phase III trial with strict preoperative staging and surgical resection guidelines.
Patients and methods:
Patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagogastric junction (AEGII and III) were randomly assigned to treatment A followed by surgery or to surgery alone. The primary outcome was overall survival.
Results:
This trial was stopped for poor accrual after 144 patients were randomly assigned (72:72); 52.8% patients had tumors located in the proximal third of the stomach, including AEG type II and III. After a median follow‐up of 4.4 years and 67 deaths, the median survival was 64.6 months (95% CI, 42.4 to NA) in the treatment A arm versus 52.5 month (95% CI 31.7 to NA) in the surgery alone arm (hazard ratio 0.84; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.35; P = .466). The survival rate at 2 year was respectively 72.7% (95% CI, 60.7‐81.7) and 69.9% (95% CI, 57.7‐79.2) in the treatment A and surgery‐only arm. The HR for progression free survival was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.49‐ 1.16; p=.20). The International Union against Cancer R0 resection rate was 81.9% after treatment A as compared with 66.7% with surgery alone (P = .036). The surgery‐only group had more lymph node metastases than the treatment A (76.5% v 61.4%; p = .018). Postoperative complications were more frequent in the treatment A arm (27.1% v 16.2%; P = .09).
Conclusion:
Treatment A followed by surgery was not more effective than surgery alone on overall survival in patients with locally advanced cancer of the stomach.",no_spin,yes,"[{'token': 'Yes', 'bytes': [89, 101, 115], 'logprob': -0.023653163}, {'token': 'yes', 'bytes': [121, 101, 115], 'logprob': -3.7736533}, {'token': 'No', 'bytes': [78, 111], 'logprob': -8.023653}, {'token': '\n', 'bytes': [10], 'logprob': -9.898653}, {'token': ' yes', 'bytes': [32, 121, 101, 115], 'logprob': -11.398653}, {'token': 'no', 'bytes': [110, 111], 'logprob': -11.398653}, {'token': '   ', 'bytes': [32, 32, 32], 'logprob': -12.898653}, {'token': '_yes', 'bytes': [95, 121, 101, 115], 'logprob': -12.898653}, {'token': ' ', 'bytes': [32], 'logprob': -14.648653}, {'token': 'The', 'bytes': [84, 104, 101], 'logprob': -15.023653}, {'token': 'YES', 'bytes': [89, 69, 83], 'logprob': -15.148653}, {'token': '  ', 'bytes': [32, 32], 'logprob': -15.148653}, {'token': '<|end|>', 'bytes': None, 'logprob': -15.148653}, {'token': ' Yes', 'bytes': [32, 89, 101, 115], 'logprob': -16.023653}, {'token': '**', 'bytes': [42, 42], 'logprob': -16.648653}, {'token': 'This', 'bytes': [84, 104, 105, 115], 'logprob': -16.648653}, {'token': '\u200b\u200b', 'bytes': [226, 128, 139, 226, 128, 139], 'logprob': -16.773653}, {'token': '    \n', 'bytes': [32, 32, 32, 32, 10], 'logprob': -17.023653}, {'token': '-', 'bytes': [45], 'logprob': -17.023653}, {'token': '“Yes', 'bytes': [226, 128, 156, 89, 101, 115], 'logprob': -17.148653}]"

High levels of distress and need for self‐care information by patients commencing chemotherapy suggest that current prechemotherapy education is suboptimal. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of a prechemotherapy education intervention (treatment A) to assess impact on patient distress, treatment‐related concerns, and the prevalence and severity of and bother caused by six chemotherapy side‐effects.
Patients and methods:
One hundred and ninety‐two breast, gastrointestinal, and haematologic cancer patients were recruited before the trial closing prematurely (original target 352). Treatment A was administered before first treatment (intervention 1), 48 h after first treatment (intervention 2), and immediately before second treatment (intervention 3). Patient outcomes were measured at baseline (T1: pre‐education) and immediately preceding treatment cycles 1 (T2) and 3 (T3).
Results:
Treatment A did not significantly reduce patient distress. However, a significant decrease in sensory/psychological (P=0.027) and procedural (P=0.03) concerns, as well as prevalence and severity of and bother due to vomiting (all P=0.001), were observed at T3. In addition, subgroup analysis of patients with elevated distress at T1 indicated a significant decrease (P=0.035) at T2 but not at T3 (P=0.055) in treatment A patients.

Treatment A, has activity alone and in combination with docetaxel (Taxotere) and prednisone (DP) in metastatic castration‐resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). A randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled phase II trial compared DP combined with either treatment A (A) or placebo in chemonaive mCRPC.
Patients and methods:
Men with progressive mCRPC despite androgen deprivation were eligible and randomized 1:1. Patients received docetaxel (75 mg/m2 day 1) and prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily every 21 days with either treatment A or placebo twice daily orally on days 1‐3. The primary end point was overall survival (OS).
Results:
Two hundred and twenty‐one patients were randomly assigned. Median OS for treatment A plus docetaxel‐prednisone (ADP) and placebo‐DP was 18.1 versus 17.8 months [hazard ratio (HR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.72‐1.55, P=0.63]. Secondary end points were also not statistically different. Grade 3/4 toxic effects for ADP versus placebo‐DP were cardiac events (5% versus 2%), lymphopenia (23% versus 16%), neutropenia (47% versus 40%), ileus (2% versus 0%) and pulmonary embolism (6% versus 2%).

48,22112969,"Randomized phase II trial of docetaxel plus prednisone in combination with placebo or AT-101, an oral small molecule Bcl-2 family antagonist, as first-line therapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer",Ann Oncol,"Background:
Treatment A, has activity alone and in combination with docetaxel (Taxotere) and prednisone (DP) in metastatic castration‐resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). A randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled phase II trial compared DP combined with either treatment A (A) or placebo in chemonaive mCRPC.
Patients and methods:
Men with progressive mCRPC despite androgen deprivation were eligible and randomized 1:1. Patients received docetaxel (75 mg/m2 day 1) and prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily every 21 days with either treatment A or placebo twice daily orally on days 1‐3. The primary end point was overall survival (OS).
Results:
Two hundred and twenty‐one patients were randomly assigned. Median OS for treatment A plus docetaxel‐prednisone (ADP) and placebo‐DP was 18.1 versus 17.8 months [hazard ratio (HR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.72‐1.55, P=0.63]. Secondary end points were also not statistically different. Grade 3/4 toxic effects for ADP versus placebo‐DP were cardiac events (5% versus 2%), lymphopenia (23% versus 16%), neutropenia (47% versus 40%), ileus (2% versus 0%) and pulmonary embolism (6% versus 2%). In a subgroup of high‐risk mCRPC (n=34), outcomes appeared to favor ADP (median OS 19 versus 14 months).

A phase III study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) to evaluate the effect on response rate and survival of a treatment A.
Patients and methods:
Four hundred fifty‐six patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B in combination with 5‐FU (500 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) i.v., every 21 days for a maximum of six cycles (eight in case of CR).
Results:
Of 456 patients, 390 were evaluable for efficacy. Objective response (CR + PR) was seen in 57% (treatment A) vs. 41% (comparator B) of the evaluable patients (P = 0.003). The CR rate was higher in the treatment A arm (12% vs. 7%, P = 0.07). Treatment A produced significantly higher response rates in patients with visceral localization (50% vs. 34%, P = 0.011) and in patients with more than two metastatic organ sites (64% vs. 37%, P = 0.001). Median time to progression (7.6 vs. 7 months) and overall survival (18 months vs. 17 months) were similar. Myelosuppression was the principal toxic effect, with grade IV neutropenia observed in 57% of the patients treated with treatment A vs. 9% of those on comparator B. Grade IV infection or febrile neutropenia were observed in 8% (treatment A) vs. 0.4% (comparator B), but the incidence of septic death was the same in the two arms (two patients each). Cardiac toxicity was similar in the two treatment groups, with 5% vs. 3% of the patients taken off study due to cardiac events, primarily due to a decline in LVEF. Only three patients (two in treatment A) experienced congestive heart failure.
Conclusion:
This trial shows that treatment A can be administered for repeated cycles without bone marrow support with increased, though acceptable, toxicity and with a significant increase of antitumor effect (especially in visceral and/or high‐burden disease), but no increased survival.",spin,no,"[{'token': 'No', 'bytes': [78, 111], 'logprob': -0.86985177}, {'token': 'Yes', 'bytes': [89, 101, 115], 'logprob': -1.1198518}, {'token': 'no', 'bytes': [110, 111], 'logprob': -1.6198518}, {'token': 'yes', 'bytes': [121, 101, 115], 'logprob': -2.8698518}, {'token': ' no', 'bytes': [32, 110, 111], 'logprob': -11.869852}, {'token': ' yes', 'bytes': [32, 121, 101, 115], 'logprob': -12.119852}, {'token': '\n', 'bytes': [10], 'logprob': -12.119852}, {'token': '   ', 'bytes': [32, 32, 32], 'logprob': -12.619852}, {'token': '_no', 'bytes': [95, 110, 111], 'logprob': -14.619852}, {'token': ' ', 'bytes': [32], 'logprob': -15.244852}, {'token': '\tno', 'bytes': [9, 110, 111], 'logprob': -15.869852}, {'token': '<|end|>', 'bytes': None, 'logprob': -15.869852}, {'token': '  ', 'bytes': [32, 32], 'logprob': -16.119852}, {'token': '_yes', 'bytes': [95, 121, 101, 115], 'logprob': -16.244852}, {'token': ' No', 'bytes': [32, 78, 111], 'logprob': -16.369852}, {'token': 'The', 'bytes': [84, 104, 101], 'logprob': -16.744852}, {'token': '    ', 'bytes': [32, 32, 32, 32], 'logprob': -16.869852}, {'token': 'NO', 'bytes': [78, 79], 'logprob': -16.994852}, {'token': ' Yes', 'bytes': [32, 89, 101, 115], 'logprob': -16.994852}, {'token': '\u200b\u200b', 'bytes': [226, 128, 139, 226, 128, 139], 'logprob': -17.494852}]"
