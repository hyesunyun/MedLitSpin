        "abstract": "Purpose:\nThis phase III study compared the efficacy and safety of treatment A with comparator B in advanced breast cancer.\nPatients and methods:\nPatients were randomly assigned to treatment A or comparator B. Comparison of progression\u2010free survival (PFS) was the primary objective.\nResults:\nPatient characteristics were balanced between arms (N = 305). Median PFS was 8.05 months (95% CI, 6.60 to 8.71) for treatment A and 7.98 (95% CI, 6.93 to 8.77) for comparator B (log\u2010rank P = .121). Overall response rate (ORR) was 32% in both arms, and overall survival (OS) was not different between arms (P = .983). Time to treatment failure (TTF; defined as discontinuation, progressive disease, death as a result of any cause, or the start of a new anticancer therapy) was superior in the treatment A arm (P = .059). Hematologic toxicity was similar in both arms, except for grades 3 to 4 leukopenia (treatment A, 78%; comparator B, 66%; P = .025) and transfusions (treatment A, 17%; comparator B, 7%; P = .0051). Grades 3 to 4 diarrhea, mucositis, and hand\u2010and\u2010foot syndrome were significantly higher in the comparator B arm. Fewer patients in the treatment A arm discontinued because of drug\u2010related adverse events (13% v 27% in CD; P = .002).\nConclusion:\nNo difference was observed between treatment A and comparator B arms in PFS, ORR, and OS. TTF was longer in the treatment A arm. These findings, combined with a nonhematologic toxicity profile that favors treatment A over approved doses of comparator B, suggest that treatment A may be a better option than comparator B in this clinical setting.",
