53,17264336,Phase III trial of concurrent or sequential adjuvant chemoradiotherapy after conservative surgery for early-stage breast cancer: final results of the ARCOSEIN trial,J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
In 1996, we initiated the multicenter phase III randomized trial to compare the effect on disease‐free survival (DFS) of experimental treatment A versus comparator B after breast‐conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer. This report presents the clinical results with a median follow‐up of 60 months.
Patients and methods:
Between February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery.
Results:
There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5‐year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis‐free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76). Nevertheless, in the node‐positive subgroup, the 5‐year LRFS was statistically better in the treatment A arm (97% in treatment A v 91% in comparator B; P = .02), corresponding to a risk of locoregional recurrence decreased by 39% (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.93).
Conclusion:
This treatment protocol remains an appealing clinical option for many women with operable breast cancer at a high risk of recurrence. Combination treatments with new drugs for breast cancer are warranted.",spin,7,"[{'token': '7', 'logits': [-0.9687943458557129, -0.0011822147062048316], 'probability': [0.379540354013443, 0.9988184571266174]}]",7,"[{'token': '7', 'logits': [-1.0789167881011963, -0.0007580029196105897], 'probability': [0.33996355533599854, 0.9992423057556152]}]",7,"[{'token': '7', 'logits': [-1.0099594593048096, -0.0004663571889977902], 'probability': [0.36423376202583313, 0.9995337128639221]}]",10,"[{'token': '10', 'logits': [-1.2701598405838013, -0.00013684290752280504], 'probability': [0.2807867228984833, 0.9998631477355957]}]",10,"[{'token': '10', 'logits': [-1.1524124145507812, -0.00017379203927703202], 'probability': [0.3158738315105438, 0.999826192855835]}]"

This report presents the clinical results with a median follow‐up of 60 months.
Patients and methods:
Between February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial (358 randomized to comparator B and 358 to treatment A) and respectively 343 and 352 patients were included in the analysis. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery. The primary endpoint was disease‐free survival (DFS) defined as the time from randomization to the first treatment failure (in the ipsilateral breast, in the axillary/infraclavicular/IMCs, or at a distant site) or death (if no recurrence had been noted).
Results:
There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5‐year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis‐free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76).

15,19273714,Phase III study of gemcitabine plus docetaxel compared with capecitabine plus docetaxel for anthracycline-pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer,J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
This phase III study compared the efficacy and safety of treatment A with comparator B in advanced breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
Patients were randomly assigned to treatment A or comparator B. Comparison of progression‐free survival (PFS) was the primary objective.
Results:
Patient characteristics were balanced between arms (N = 305). Median PFS was 8.05 months (95% CI, 6.60 to 8.71) for treatment A and 7.98 (95% CI, 6.93 to 8.77) for comparator B (log‐rank P = .121). Overall response rate (ORR) was 32% in both arms, and overall survival (OS) was not different between arms (P = .983). Time to treatment failure (TTF; defined as discontinuation, progressive disease, death as a result of any cause, or the start of a new anticancer therapy) was superior in the treatment A arm (P = .059). Hematologic toxicity was similar in both arms, except for grades 3 to 4 leukopenia (treatment A, 78%; comparator B, 66%; P = .025) and transfusions (treatment A, 17%; comparator B, 7%; P = .0051). Grades 3 to 4 diarrhea, mucositis, and hand‐and‐foot syndrome were significantly higher in the comparator B arm. Fewer patients in the treatment A arm discontinued because of drug‐related adverse events (13% v 27% in CD; P = .002).
Conclusion:
No difference was observed between treatment A and comparator B arms in PFS, ORR, and OS. TTF was longer in the treatment A arm. These findings, combined with a nonhematologic toxicity profile that favors treatment A over approved doses of comparator B, suggest that treatment A may be a better option than comparator B in this clinical setting.",spin,7,"[{'token': '7', 'logits': [-0.9407081604003906, -0.002462689997628331], 'probability': [0.3903512954711914, 0.9975404143333435]}]",8,"[{'token': '8', 'logits': [-1.1739288568496704, -0.0006470970110967755], 'probability': [0.30914995074272156, 0.9993530511856079]}]",7,"[{'token': '7', 'logits': [-1.1982215642929077, -0.0022677676752209663], 'probability': [0.30173036456108093, 0.997734785079956]}]",10,"[{'token': '10', 'logits': [-1.1068737506866455, -0.00012087091454304755], 'probability': [0.3305908441543579, 0.9998791217803955]}]",10,"[{'token': '10', 'logits': [-1.156801700592041, -0.00016127715934999287], 'probability': [0.3144904375076294, 0.9998387098312378]}]"

A phase III study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) to evaluate the effect on response rate and survival of a treatment A.
Patients and methods:
Four hundred fifty‐six patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B in combination with 5‐FU (500 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) i.v., every 21 days for a maximum of six cycles (eight in case of CR).
Results:
Of 456 patients, 390 were evaluable for efficacy. Objective response (CR + PR) was seen in 57% (treatment A) vs. 41% (comparator B) of the evaluable patients (P = 0.003). The CR rate was higher in the treatment A arm (12% vs. 7%, P = 0.07). Treatment A produced significantly higher response rates in patients with visceral localization (50% vs. 34%, P = 0.011) and in patients with more than two metastatic organ sites (64% vs. 37%, P = 0.001). Median time to progression (7.6 vs. 7 months) and overall survival (18 months vs. 17 months) were similar. Myelosuppression was the principal toxic effect, with grade IV neutropenia observed in 57% of the patients treated with treatment A vs. 9% of those on comparator B. Grade IV infection or febrile neutropenia were observed in 8% (treatment A) vs. 0.4% (comparator B), but the incidence of septic death was the same in the two arms (two patients each). Cardiac toxicity was similar in the two treatment groups, with 5% vs. 3% of the patients taken off study due to cardiac events, primarily due to a decline in LVEF. Only three patients (two in treatment A) experienced congestive heart failure.
Conclusion:
This trial shows that treatment A can be administered for repeated cycles without bone marrow support with increased, though acceptable, toxicity and with a significant increase of antitumor effect (especially in visceral and/or high‐burden disease), but no increased survival.",spin,7,"[{'token': '7', 'logits': [-1.1294479370117188, -0.0006901028100401163], 'probability': [0.3232116401195526, 0.9993100762367249]}]",8,"[{'token': '8', 'logits': [-1.0880004167556763, -0.00032276666024699807], 'probability': [0.33688947558403015, 0.9996771812438965]}]",8,"[{'token': '8', 'logits': [-1.31376051902771, -0.00048637480358593166], 'probability': [0.2688073217868805, 0.9995137453079224]}]",10,"[{'token': '10', 'logits': [-1.1687453985214233, -0.0001248043408850208], 'probability': [0.3107565641403198, 0.9998751878738403]}]",10,"[{'token': '10', 'logits': [-1.0412914752960205, -0.00015889335190877318], 'probability': [0.3529984951019287, 0.999841034412384]}]"
