Randomized trial of fenretinide to prevent second breast malignancy in women with early breast cancer",J Natl Cancer Inst,"Background:
Treatment A has been shown to inhibit breast carcinogenesis in preclinical studies. We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.
Methods:
We randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30‐70 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66‐1.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64‐1.09; P = .177) between the two arms. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs (38 in the treatment A arm versus 40 in the control arm), incidence of distant metastasis (HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.79‐1.22; P = .858), and all‐cause mortality (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.92‐1.48; P = .215).
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than no treatment in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.",no_spin,0,0,"[{'token': 15, 'token_string': '0', 'logits': -0.2601962089538574, 'probability': 0.7709002494812012}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -3.576272320060525e-06, 'probability': 0.9999964237213135}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.2043818235397339, 'probability': 0.815151035785675}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -1.2993727978027891e-05, 'probability': 0.999987006187439}]",4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -1.281957745552063, 'probability': 0.27749350666999817}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -3.576272320060525e-06, 'probability': 0.9999964237213135}]",2,2,"[{'token': 17, 'token_string': '2', 'logits': -0.3066188395023346, 'probability': 0.7359309792518616}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -2.622600959512056e-06, 'probability': 0.9999973773956299}]",2,2,"[{'token': 17, 'token_string': '2', 'logits': -0.04415452480316162, 'probability': 0.9568060636520386}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -2.7418097943154862e-06, 'probability': 0.9999973177909851}]"

Results:
At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (P =.642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (P =.177) between the two arms. However, an interaction was detected between treatment A and menopausal status in both outcomes (P for interaction in both outcomes =.045), with a possible beneficial effect in premenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66, and 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.41‐1.07; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 0.65, and 95% CI = 0.46‐0. 92) and an opposite effect in postmenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.32, and 95% CI = 0.82‐2.15; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.19, and 95% CI = 0.75‐1. 89). There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs, incidence of distant metastasis, and all‐cause mortality.

Efficacy and safety of treatment A was compared with comparator B in a group of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, without previous systemic therapy for advanced breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
The study was a prospective double‐blind randomized trial. All treated patients presented with positive estrogen receptors. Main end points were response rates, toxicity profile analysis, time to progression and survival. WHO and ECOG criteria were employed for response evaluation while toxicity was assessed according to WHO guidelines.

34,12177098,"Double-blind, randomized trial comparing the efficacy and tolerability of fulvestrant versus anastrozole in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer progressing on prior endocrine therapy: results of a North American trial",J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
To compare the efficacy and tolerability of treatment A with comparator B in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in patients whose disease progresses on prior endocrine treatment.
Patients and methods:
In this double‐blind, double‐dummy, parallel‐group study, postmenopausal patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP). Secondary end points included time to treatment failure (TTF), objective response (OR) rate, duration of response (DOR), and tolerability.
Results:
Patients (n = 400) were followed for a median period of 16.8 months. Treatment A was not more effective than comparator B in terms of TTP (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 1.14; P =.43); median TTP was 5.4 months with treatment A and 3.4 months with comparator B. There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups for TTF. Median TTF was 4.6 months for treatment A and 3.3 months for comparator B (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.19; P = .69). At the time of this data analysis, the rate of deaths was respectively for treatment A and comparator B, 35.4% (n=73) vs. 33.5% (n=65). OR rates were 17.5% with both treatments. DOR was statistically significantly greater for treatment A compared with comparator B; the ratio of average response durations was 1.35 (95% CI, 1.10 to 1.67; P < 0.01).

33,12177098,"Double-blind, randomized trial comparing the efficacy and tolerability of fulvestrant versus anastrozole in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer progressing on prior endocrine therapy: results of a North American trial",J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
To compare the efficacy and tolerability of treatment A with comparator B in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in patients whose disease progresses on prior endocrine treatment.
Patients and methods:
In this double‐blind, double‐dummy, parallel‐group study, postmenopausal patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP). Secondary end points included objective response (OR) rate, duration of response (DOR), and tolerability.
Results:
Patients (n = 400) were followed for a median period of 16.8 months. Treatment A was as effective as comparator B in terms of TTP (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 1.14; P =.43); median TTP was 5.4 months with treatment A and 3.4 months with comparator B. OR rates were 17.5% with both treatments. Clinical benefit rates (complete response + partial response + stable disease > or = 24 weeks) were 42.2% for treatment A and 36.1% for comparator B (95% CI, ‐4.00% to 16.41%; P =.26). In responding patients, median DOR (from randomization to progression) was 19.0 months for treatment A and 10.8 months for comparator B. Using all patients, DOR was significantly greater for treatment A compared with comparator B; the ratio of average response durations was 1.35 (95% CI, 1.10 to 1.67; P < 0.01). Both treatments were well tolerated.
Conclusion:
Treatment A was at least as effective as comparator B, with efficacy end points slightly favoring treatment A.

To determine whether treatment A, improves survival in patients with brain metastases when used as an adjunct to whole‐brain radiation therapy (WBRT).
Patients and methods:
Patients with brain metastases from solid tumors and a Karnofsky performance score of > or = 70 were randomly assigned to receive WBRT with supplemental oxygen and either treatment A (treatment A arm) or no treatment (control arm). The primary end point was survival.
Results:

There was not a statistically significant difference in the cumulative incidence at 1 year after random assignment of radiographic (21% treatment A vs. 18% control; p=0.53) or clinical progression (49% treatment A vs. 51% control; p = 0.49) in the brain between the treatment groups. At 6 months, respectively 16% and 15% of the patients had a stable or improving quality of life in treatment A arm and control arm. The most common severe adverse event in patients treated with treatment A was hypoxemia.

37,16504757,A phase III randomized trial comparing adjuvant concomitant chemoradiotherapy versus standard adjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy in operable node-positive breast cancer: final results,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"Purpose:
To compare treatment A and comparator B in node‐positive, operable breast cancer patients.
Methods and materials:
This was a randomized, multicenter, phase III trial enrolling 638 eligible women with prior breast surgery and positive axillary dissection. Patients in Arm A received treatment A, with concomitant radiotherapy (50 Gy +/‐ 10‐20‐Gy boost). Patients in Arm B received comparator B, with subsequent radiotherapy.
Results:
Median treatment durations were 64 and 126 days (Arms A and B, respectively), with no significant difference in overall or disease‐free survival. Five‐year locoregional relapse‐free survival favored patients with conservative surgery (two thirds of the population), with less local and / or regional recurrence in Arm A than in Arm B (3% vs. 9%; p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis in this subgroup showed a 2.8‐fold increased risk of locoregional recurrence with comparator B, independent of other prognostic factors (p = 0.027). Febrile neutropenia and Grade 3‐4 leukopenia were significantly more frequent in Arm A. Subclinical left ventricular ejection fraction events at 1 year were more frequent with treatment A (p = 0.02).

The contribution of treatment A in breast cancer patients after receiving adjuvant chemotherapy is not fully established. We investigated the impact of treatment A, given sequentially after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with operable breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
Between March 1991 and June 1999, 1863 women with stages I‐IIIA operable breast cancer who had undergone surgery and completed six cycles of adjuvant combination chemotherapy with either CMF, CAF, CEF, FAC or FEC were randomized to receive either treatment A for 3 years or no further treatment. Irrespective of menstrual status and hormone receptor content of the primary tumor, patients were stratified by institute, chemotherapy scheme and age (above 50 years or younger). The main end‐point was to detect a 5% increase in the 5 year survival (from 80% to 85%) in favor of treatment A. Secondary end‐ points were relapse free survival (RFS), local control, incidence of second primary breast cancer.
Results:
After exclusion of all patients from three sites because of inadequate documentation, a total of 1724 patients (93%) were analyzed (Treatment A 861 and Control 863). At a median follow‐up of 6.5 years, 396 deaths (23%) and 602 RFS events (35%) (relapse and/or death) have been observed. There was no statistically significant difference in survival between patients who were randomized to receive treatment A for 3 years and those who were randomized to no further treatment (HR 0.97; 95% CI, 0.79‐1.18; p = 0.7377 by log‐rank test). At a median follow‐up of 6.5 years, 5‐year RFS on treatment A was 73% versus 67% in controls (p=0.035). Thirty eight patients (4.4%) in the treatment A arm discontinued treatment because of toxicity. The most common reasons for discontinuation were hot flashes (n = 8), vaginal bleeding (n = 7), weight gain (n = 4) and nausea (n = 4).

To assess whether the use of intervention A as an adjunct to colposcopy increases the detection of biopsy confirmed CIN 2, 3 (high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia).
Methods:
This is a multicenter two‐arm randomized trial comparing colposcopy alone with colposcopy plus intervention A. Patients were recruited from 13 colposcopy clinics in a variety of practice settings. 2299 women referred for the evaluation of an abnormal cervical cytology were randomized with stratification by cytology; subsequently 113 women were excluded for a variety of reasons. The main study outcomes were differences in true‐positive rates (CIN 2, 3 and cancer identified) and false‐positive rates between the study arms.
Results:
The true‐positive (TP) rates were 14.4% vs. 11.4% (p=0.035, one‐sided) for the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm compared to colposcopy‐only arm, respectively, in women with either an atypical squamous cell (ASC) or low‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) cytology result. TP rates were similar between the two arms among women referred for the evaluation of HSIL (high‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). The 26.5% gain in true‐positives observed with the use of intervention A and colposcopy among women referred for an ASC or LSIL cytology was achieved with only a fractional increase in number of biopsies obtained per patient (0.30) and a modest increase in false‐positive rate
(4%). In the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm among women with ASC or LSIL, the PPV (positive predictive value) of biopsies indicated by ntervention A was 15.0% and the PPV of biopsies indicated by colposcopy was 15.2%. Joint hypothesis testing indicates that intervention A and colposcopy provides benefit compared to colposcopy alone among women with ASC or LSIL.

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of treatment A plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) therapy in comparison with CAF alone, in patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
In this randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial, patients were treated with six cycles of CAF therapy: 28 days/cycle, with doxorubicin (25 mg/m2) and fluorouracil (500 mg/m2) administered on days 1 and 8 and cyclophosphamide (100 mg orally [PO]) administered on day 1 through 14.

In 1996, we initiated the multicenter phase III randomized trial to compare the effect on disease‐free survival (DFS) of experimental treatment A versus comparator B after breast‐conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer. This report presents the clinical results with a median follow‐up of 60 months.
Patients and methods:
Between February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery.
Results:
There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5‐year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis‐free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76). Nevertheless, in the node‐positive subgroup, the 5‐year LRFS was statistically better in the treatment A arm (97% in treatment A v 91% in comparator B; P = .02), corresponding to a risk of locoregional recurrence decreased by 39% (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.93).

This phase III randomized open‐label clinical trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment A versus comparator B as first‐line treatment for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in postmenopausal women.
Patients and methods:
The study was conducted at 81 centers and enrolled postmenopausal patients with measurable hormone‐sensitive metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer. Prior adjuvant chemotherapy and/or comparator B were allowed. One previous chemotherapy regimen and no prior hormone therapy for advanced disease were permitted. Patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment A or comparator B until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. Progression‐free survival (PFS) as the primary study end point.
Results:
Of the 382 patients randomized at 79 sites, 371 (182 treatment A, 189 comparator B) were included in the analysis. No treatment related death were observed. A total of 319 events (progression or death) were observed: 161 (85%) in the comparator B arm and 158 (87%) in the treatment A arm. Median progression‐ free survival (PFS) (primary outcome) was 5.8 months with comparator B (95% CI, 5.3 to 8.1 months) vs 9.9 months; (95% CI, 8.7 to 11.8 months) with treatment A, HR = 0.84 (95% CI, 0.67 to 1.05), p = .121. No statistically significant differences in overall survival were observed between treatment arms: median overall survival for comparator B and treatment A was 43.3 vs. 37.2 months, HR=1.04 (95% CI, 0.76 to 1.41).

35,18794551,Phase III study comparing exemestane with tamoxifen as first-line hormonal treatment of metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women: the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Breast Cancer Cooperative Group,J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
This phase III randomized open‐label clinical trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment A versus comparator B as first‐line treatment for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in postmenopausal women.
Patients and methods:
The study was conducted at 81 centers and enrolled postmenopausal patients with measurable hormone‐sensitive metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer. Prior adjuvant chemotherapy and/or comparator B were allowed. One previous chemotherapy regimen and no prior hormone therapy for advanced disease were permitted. Patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment A or comparator B until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred.
Results:
A total of 371 patients enrolled at 79 sites (182 treatment A, 189 comparator B) were included in the analysis. Both treatments were generally well tolerated without major toxicity. Overall response rate was greater for treatment A than for comparator B (46% v 31%; odds ratio = 1.85; 95% CI, 1.21 to 2.82; P = .005). Median progression‐free survival (PFS) was longer with treatment A (9.9 months; 95% CI, 8.7 to 11.8 months) than with comparator B (5.8 months; 95% CI, 5.3 to 8.1 months). However, these early differences (Wilcoxon P = .028) did not translate to a longer‐term benefit in PFS, the primary study end point (log‐rank P = .121). There was also no difference in survival between both study arms.

Treatment A is an effective and well‐tolerated first‐line hormonal treatment for postmenopausal women with MBC and offers significant early improvement in time to tumor progression when compared with comparator B.",spin,6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.08428652584552765, 'probability': 0.9191678166389465}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -7.033323527139146e-06, 'probability': 0.9999929666519165}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.19270221889019012, 'probability': 0.8247275352478027}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -1.1801649634435307e-05, 'probability': 0.9999881982803345}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.2993413805961609, 'probability': 0.7413063049316406}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -6.556489552167477e-06, 'probability': 0.9999934434890747}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.1669936180114746, 'probability': 0.8462049961090088}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -6.198863957251888e-06, 'probability': 0.9999938607215881}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.6017532348632812, 'probability': 0.5478503108024597}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -5.245195097813848e-06, 'probability': 0.9999947547912598}]"

Treatment A is effective against HER‐2‐positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy of treatment A in HER‐2‐negative and HER‐2‐uncharacterized MBC.
Patients and methods:
Women with MBC were randomly assigned to first‐line therapy with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks plus treatment A or placebo. A preplanned retrospective evaluation of HER‐2 status was performed using fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP); secondary end points were objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), event‐free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS).
Results:
In the intent‐to‐treat population (n = 579), there were no significant differences in TTP, EFS, or OS between treatment arms, although differences in ORR and CBR were noted. In 86 HER‐2‐positive patients (15%), treatment with paclitaxel‐ treatment A resulted in statistically significant improvements in TTP, EFS, ORR, and CBR compared with paclitaxel‐placebo. No differences between treatment groups were observed for any end point in HER‐2‐negative patients. The most common adverse events were alopecia, rash, and diarrhea. The incidence of diarrhea and rash was significantly higher in the paclitaxel‐treatment A arm. The rate of cardiac events was low, and no difference was observed between treatment arms.
Conclusion:
Patients with HER‐2‐negative or HER‐2‐untested MBC did not benefit from the addition of treatment A to paclitaxel. However, first‐line therapy with paclitaxel‐ treatment A significantly improved clinical outcomes in HER‐2‐positive patients.

This phase III study compared the efficacy and safety of treatment A with comparator B in advanced breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
Patients were randomly assigned to treatment A or comparator B. Comparison of progression‐free survival (PFS) was the primary objective.
Results:
Patient characteristics were balanced between arms (N = 305). Median PFS was 8.05 months (95% CI, 6.60 to 8.71) for treatment A and 7.98 (95% CI, 6.93 to 8.77) for comparator B (log‐rank P = .121).

Many cancer patients continue to smoke postdiagnosis, yet there have been few smoking cessation trials for this population.
Methods:
This double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial randomized 246 cancer patients to 9 weeks of placebo or treatment A, stratifying by pre‐treatment depression symptoms. In addition, all patients received transdermal nicotine and behavioral counseling. Primary outcomes were 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence, biochemically confirmed, at the end of treatment (Week 12), and at 6 months post quit day (Week 27). Additional outcomes included: withdrawal, affect, quality of life, compliance, and side effects.

This double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial randomized 246 cancer patients to 9 weeks of placebo or treatment A, stratifying by pre‐treatment depression symptoms. In addition, all patients received transdermal nicotine and behavioral counseling. Primary outcomes were 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence, biochemically confirmed, at the end of treatment (Week 12), and at 6 months post quit day (Week 27). Additional outcomes included: withdrawal, affect, quality of life, compliance, and side effects.
Results:
There was no main effect of treatment A vs. placebo on abstinence (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.38‐4.81, p = 0.64). Patients with depression symptoms reported significantly lower abstinence rates vs. patients without depression symptoms (OR = .14, 95% CI: 0.02‐0.80, p=0.03). Treatment A increased abstinence rates, vs. placebo, more for participants with depression vs. those without depression symptoms. For patients with depression symptoms, treatment A reduced withdrawal symptoms and improved quality of life vs. placebo.
Conclusion:
For patients with depression symptoms, treatment increases abstinence rates, lowers withdrawal, and increases quality of life. However, abstinence rates among patients with depression symptoms were low vs. patients without depression symptoms, who exhibited similar abstinence rates when treated with treatment A or transdermal nicotine and counseling alone. These results can guide future smoking cessation intervention studies with cancer patients.",spin,6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.41865071654319763, 'probability': 0.6579340100288391}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -8.34461570775602e-06, 'probability': 0.9999916553497314}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.06229428946971893, 'probability': 0.9396063089370728}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -1.6569954823353328e-05, 'probability': 0.9999834299087524}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.3139519691467285, 'probability': 0.7305541038513184}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -5.960446742392378e-06, 'probability': 0.9999939799308777}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.7959772348403931, 'probability': 0.4511401057243347}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -5.8412379075889476e-06, 'probability': 0.9999942183494568}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -0.8697091341018677, 'probability': 0.4190734326839447}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -4.529942543740617e-06, 'probability': 0.9999955296516418}]"

We aimed to compare overall survival in patients receiving treatment A or comparator B.
Methods:
This was an open‐label randomized trial undertaken in 50 centres across eight countries. 1006 treatment‐naive patients diagnosed with advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma were randomly allocated (1 to 1) by minimization to receive comparator B or treatment A. Treatment was not masked. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Treatment groups were compared with a non‐stratified log‐ rank test. Analysis was by intention to treat.

Findings:
502 patients were randomly assigned to receive comparator B and 504 to receive combined treatment A. Median follow‐up was 37.2 months (24.8‐52.3).

The authors conducted a multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐ controlled, phase 3, clinical trial to examine the effect of treatment A on patient‐ reported fatigue in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. A sample of 877 cancer patients beginning chemotherapy at 23 geographically separate University of Rochester Cancer Center (URCC) Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) affiliates were assessed for fatigue. Patients who reported fatigue (N = 867) were randomly assigned to receive either treatment A or a placebo. Treatment began on Day 5 of Cycle 2 and ended after Day 7 of Cycle 4. Fatigue, sleepiness and depression were assessed during Cycles 2 to 4 by using psychometrically valid measures. The primary outcome was the worst level of cancer related fatigue during the previous week at Cycle 4. Group differences (treatment vs. placebo) were examined by using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusting for baseline fatigue (Cycle 2).
Results:
There were 631 patients (315 treatment A, 316 placebo) who provided evaluable data and were analyzed. There was no statistical significant difference for the worst level of cancer related fatigue between treatment A (mean (SE) = 6.87 (0.14) and placebo (mean (SE) = 7.09 (0.13); p = 0.08. Sleepiness was statistically significantly higher in placebo (mean (SE) = 18.38 (0.31) vs. treatment A (mean (SE) = 16.82 (0.26); p = 0.002. Treatment A had no statistically significant effect on depression (p=0.87)
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than placebo in controlling cancer‐related fatigue.",no_spin,2,2,"[{'token': 17, 'token_string': '2', 'logits': -0.2613101303577423, 'probability': 0.7700420618057251}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -3.4570634852570947e-06, 'probability': 0.999996542930603}]",9,9,"[{'token': 24, 'token_string': '9', 'logits': -0.31394970417022705, 'probability': 0.7305557131767273}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -1.3708974620385561e-05, 'probability': 0.9999862313270569}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.4604073166847229, 'probability': 0.631026566028595}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -7.390948667307384e-06, 'probability': 0.9999926090240479}]",2,2,"[{'token': 17, 'token_string': '2', 'logits': -0.7612786889076233, 'probability': 0.4670688211917877}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -2.3841830625315197e-06, 'probability': 0.9999976754188538}]",2,2,"[{'token': 17, 'token_string': '2', 'logits': -0.09719150513410568, 'probability': 0.9073821902275085}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -3.099436753473128e-06, 'probability': 0.9999969005584717}]"

55,20973267,Randomized phase III study of canfosfamide in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin compared with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin alone in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer,Int J Gynecol Cancer,"Objective:
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment A in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer (OC).
Methods:
Patients with platinum‐refractory or ‐resistant primary or secondary) OC were randomized to receive treatment A and PLD at 50 mg/m2 intravenously or PLD alone at 50 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 every 28 days until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression‐free survival (PFS). Other end points were objective response rate and safety. The study was originally planned for 244 patients. The trial was temporarily placed on hold after 125 patients were randomized while the results of another trial were being reviewed and the sponsor decided not to resume enrollment. The interim analysis became the final analysis.
Results:
The median PFS was 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD (n = 65) versus 3.7 months for PLD (n = 60) (hazards ratio, 0.92; P = 0.7243). A preplanned subgroup analysis showed that 75 patients with platinum‐refractory or primary platinum‐resistant OC had a median PFS of 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD versus 2.9 months for PLD (hazards ratio, 0.55; P = 0.0425). Hematologic adverse events were 66% on the treatment A + PLD arm versus 44% on the PLD arm, manageable with dose reductions. Nonhematologic adverse events were similar for both arms. The incidence of palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis was lower on treatment A + PLD (23%, 31%, respectively) versus (39%, 49%, respectively) on PLD.
Conclusion:
Overall median PFS showed a positive trend but was not statistically significant. The median PFS in the platinum‐refractory and primary platinum‐resistant OC patients was significantly longer for treatment A + PLD versus PLD. Treatment A may ameliorate the palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis known to be associated with PLD.

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment A in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer (OC).
Methods:
Patients with platinum‐refractory or ‐resistant primary or secondary) OC were randomized to receive treatment A and PLD at 50 mg/m2 intravenously or PLD alone at 50 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 every 28 days until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression‐free survival (PFS). Other end points were objective response rate, and safety. The study was originally planned for 244 patients. The trial was temporarily placed on hold after 125 patients were randomized while the results of another trial were being reviewed and the sponsor decided not to resume enrollment. The interim analysis became the final analysis.
Results:
The median PFS was 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD (n = 65) versus 3.7 months for PLD (n = 60) (hazards ratio, 0.92; P = 0.7243). ORR was 12.3% for treatment A + PLD vs. 8.3% for PLD, p=0.5640. Hematologic adverse events were 66% on the treatment A + PLD arm versus 44% on the PLD arm with neutropenia 40.0% vs. 22.8%; thrombopenia 33.8% vs. 7.0%; febrile neutropenia10.8% vs. 3.5%. Nonhematologic adverse events were similar for both arms. The incidence of palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis was lower on treatment A + PLD (23%, 31%, respectively) versus (39%, 49%, respectively) on PLD. The incidence of nausea and fatigue was higher in treatment A + PLD 60.0% vs. 49.1% and 43.1% vs. 36.8%).Thirteen deaths caused by serious adverse event were reported 7 with treatment A + PLD vs. 6 with PLD.
Conclusion:
Treatment A in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin was not more effective than pegylated liposomal doxorubicin alone in patients with platinum‐ resistant ovarian cancer.

25,21041710,Adjuvant whole-brain radiotherapy versus observation after radiosurgery or surgical resection of one to three cerebral metastases: results of the EORTC 22952-26001 study,J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
This phase III trial assesses whether treatment A increases the duration of functional independence after surgery or radiosurgery of brain metastases.
Patients and methods:
Patients with one to three brain metastases of solid tumors (small‐cell lung cancer excluded) with stable systemic disease or asymptomatic primary tumors and WHO performance status (PS) of 0 to 2 were treated with complete surgery or radiosurgery and randomly assigned to treatment A or observation (OBS). The primary end point was time to WHO PS deterioration to more than 2.
Results:
Of 359 patients, 199 underwent radiosurgery, and 160 underwent surgery. In the radiosurgery group, 100 patients were allocated to OBS, and 99 were allocated to treatment A. After surgery, 79 patients were allocated to OBS, and 81 were allocated to treatment A. The median time to WHO PS more than 2 was 10.0 months (95% CI, 8.1 to 11.7 months) after OBS and 9.5 months (95% CI, 7.8 to 11.9 months) after treatment A (P = .71). Overall survival was similar in the treatment A and OBS arms (median, 10.9 v 10.7 months, respectively; P = .89). Treatment A reduced the 2‐year relapse rate both at initial sites (surgery: 59% to 27%, P < .001; radiosurgery: 31% to 19%, P = .040) and at new sites (surgery: 42% to 23%, P = .008; radiosurgery: 48% to 33%, P = .023). Salvage therapies were used more frequently after OBS than after treatment A. Intracranial progression caused death in 78 (44%) of 179 patients in the OBS arm and in 50 (28%) of 180 patients in the treatment A arm.

43,21060024,Neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with surgery alone for locally advanced cancer of the stomach and cardia: European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer randomized trial 40954,J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
We examined the value of treatment A in a phase III trial with strict preoperative staging and surgical resection guidelines.
Patients and methods:
Patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagogastric junction (AEG II and III) were randomly assigned to treatment A followed by surgery or to surgery alone. To detect with 80% power an improvement in median survival from 17 months with surgery alone to 24 months with treatment A, 282 events were required.
Results:
This trial was stopped for poor accrual after 144 patients were randomly assigned (72:72); 52.8% patients had tumors located in the proximal third of the stomach, including AEG type II and III. The International Union against Cancer R0 resection rate was 81.9% after treatment A as compared with 66.7% with surgery alone (P = .036). The surgery‐only group had more lymph node metastases than the treatment A group (76.5% v 61.4%; P = .018).

Conclusion:
This trial showed a significantly increased R0 resection rate but failed to demonstrate a survival benefit. Possible explanations are low statistical power, a high rate of proximal gastric cancer including AEG and/or a better outcome than expected after radical surgery alone due to the high quality of surgery with resections of regional lymph nodes outside the perigastic area (celiac trunc, hepatic ligament, lymph node at a. lienalis; D2).",spin,4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.45745813846588135, 'probability': 0.6328903436660767}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -4.291525328881107e-06, 'probability': 0.9999957084655762}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.010459722951054573, 'probability': 0.9895947575569153}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -2.372236667724792e-05, 'probability': 0.9999762177467346}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.19885195791721344, 'probability': 0.8196711540222168}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -8.940656698541716e-06, 'probability': 0.9999909996986389}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.42705053091049194, 'probability': 0.6524305939674377}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -6.198863957251888e-06, 'probability': 0.9999938607215881}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.7389512658119202, 'probability': 0.47761452198028564}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -6.318072337307967e-06, 'probability': 0.999993622303009}]"

7,21399726,"The use of Valeriana officinalis (Valerian) in improving sleep in patients who are undergoing treatment for cancer: a phase III randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study (NCCTG Trial, N01C5)",J Support Oncol,"Sleep disorders are a substantial problem for cancer survivors, with prevalence estimates ranging from 23% to 61%. Although numerous prescription hypnotics are available, few are approved for long‐term use or have demonstrated benefit in this circumstance. Hypnotics may have unwanted side effects and are costly, and cancer survivors often wish to avoid prescription drugs. New options with limited side effects are needed. The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of treatment A for sleep in people with cancer who were undergoing cancer treatment. Participants were randomized to receive treatment A or placebo orally 1 hour before bedtime for 8 weeks. The primary end point was area under the curve (AUC) of the overall Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Secondary outcomes included the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Toxicity was evaluated with both self‐reported numeric analogue scale questions and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0. Questionnaires were completed at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks. A total of 227 patients were randomized into this study between March 19, 2004, and March 9, 2007, with 119 being evaluable for the primary end point. The AUC over the 8 weeks for treatment A was 51.4 (SD = 16), while that for placebo was 49.7 (SD = 15), with a P value of 0.6957. A supplemental, exploratory analysis revealed that several fatigue end points, as measured by the BFI and POMS, were significantly better for those taking treatment A over placebo. Participants also reported less trouble with sleep and less drowsiness on treatment A than placebo. There were no significant differences in toxicities as measured by self‐report or the CTCAE except for mild alkaline phosphatase increases, which were slightly more common in the placebo group.

Although numerous prescription hypnotics are available, few are approved for long‐term use or have demonstrated benefit in this circumstance. Hypnotics may have unwanted side effects and are costly, and cancer survivors often wish to avoid prescription drugs. New options with limited side effects are needed. The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of a treatment A for sleep in people with cancer who were undergoing cancer treatment. Participants were randomized to receive treatment A or placebo orally 1 hour before bedtime for 8 weeks. The primary end point was area under the curve (AUC) of the overall Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Secondary outcomes included the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Toxicity was evaluated with both self‐reported numeric analogue scale questions and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0. Questionnaires were completed at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks. A total of 227 patients were randomized into this study between March 19, 2004, and March 9, 2007. Twenty‐three patients withdrew before starting the study treatment. Primary end‐point data were available on 119 patients (62 receiving treatment A and 57 receiving placebo). Baseline characteristics and baseline patient reported outcomes were well balanced between arms. The AUC over the 8 weeks for treatment A was 51.4 (SD = 16 and for placebo was 49.7 (SD = 15), with a P value of 0.7. The FOSQ was not statistically significantly different between groups.

High levels of distress and need for self‐care information by patients commencing chemotherapy suggest that current prechemotherapy education is suboptimal. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of a prechemotherapy education intervention (treatment A) to assess impact on patient distress, treatment‐related concerns, and the prevalence and severity of and bother caused by six chemotherapy side‐effects.
Patients and methods:
One hundred and ninety‐two breast, gastrointestinal, and haematologic cancer patients were recruited before the trial closing prematurely (original target 352). Treatment A was administered before first treatment (intervention 1), 48 h after first treatment (intervention 2), and immediately before second treatment (intervention 3). Patient outcomes were measured at baseline (T1: pre‐education) and immediately preceding treatment cycles 1 (T2) and 3 (T3).
Results:
Treatment A did not significantly reduce patient distress. However, a significant decrease in sensory/psychological (P=0.027) and procedural (P=0.03) concerns, as well as prevalence and severity of and bother due to vomiting (all P=0.001), were observed at T3.

A phase III study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) to evaluate the effect on response rate and survival of a treatment A.
Patients and methods:
Four hundred fifty‐six patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B in combination with 5‐FU (500 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) i.v., every 21 days for a maximum of six cycles (eight in case of CR).
Results:
Of 456 patients, 390 were evaluable for efficacy. Objective response (CR + PR) was seen in 57% (treatment A) vs. 41% (comparator B) of the evaluable patients (P = 0.003). The CR rate was higher in the treatment A arm (12% vs. 7%, P = 0.07). Treatment A produced significantly higher response rates in patients with visceral localization (50% vs. 34%, P = 0.011) and in patients with more than two metastatic organ sites (64% vs. 37%, P = 0.001). Median time to progression (7.6 vs. 7 months) and overall survival (18 months vs. 17 months) were similar. Myelosuppression was the principal toxic effect, with grade IV neutropenia observed in 57% of the patients treated with treatment A vs. 9% of those on comparator B. Grade IV infection or febrile neutropenia were observed in 8% (treatment A) vs. 0.4% (comparator B), but the incidence of septic death was the same in the two arms (two patients each). Cardiac toxicity was similar in the two treatment groups, with 5% vs. 3% of the patients taken off study due to cardiac events, primarily due to a decline in LVEF. Only three patients (two in treatment A) experienced congestive heart failure.

Four hundred fifty‐six patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B in combination with 5‐FU (500 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) i.v., every 21 days for a maximum of six cycles (eight in case of CR). The primary outcome was overall survival.
Results:
Of 456 patients randomized to treatment A (214) or comparator B (242), 390 were evaluable for efficacy (treatment A 182, comparator B 208). There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups for the primary outcome with a median survival of 18 and 17 months, respectively for treatment A and comparator B (P = 0.54). Objective response (CR + PR) was seen in 57% (treatment A) vs. 41% (comparator B) of the evaluable patients (P = 0.003). The median duration of response was 9.1 months on treatment A and 9.3 on comparator B, the median Time to Treatment Failure (TTF) was, respectively, 5.8 vs. 5.3 months (P = 0.7). Myelosuppression was the principal toxic effect, with grade IV neutropenia observed in 57% of the patients treated with treatment A vs. 9% of those on comparator B. Grade IV infection or febrile neutropenia were observed in 8% (treatment A) vs. 0.4% (comparator B), but the incidence of septic death was the same in the two arms (two patients each). Cardiac toxicity was similar in the two treatment groups, with 5% vs. 3% of the patients taken off study due to cardiac events, primarily due to a decline in LVEF. Three patients (two in treatment A) experienced congestive heart failure.
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than comparator B in patients with metastatic breast cancer.",no_spin,4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.5938069820404053, 'probability': 0.5522209405899048}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -4.0531076592742465e-06, 'probability': 0.9999960064888}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.04922156408429146, 'probability': 0.9519701600074768}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -1.6689160474925302e-05, 'probability': 0.9999833703041077}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.2499837577342987, 'probability': 0.7788134217262268}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -5.722029527532868e-06, 'probability': 0.9999942779541016}]",4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.8462207913398743, 'probability': 0.4290332794189453}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -3.099436753473128e-06, 'probability': 0.9999969005584717}]",4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.8662777543067932, 'probability': 0.42051389813423157}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -3.3378546504536644e-06, 'probability': 0.9999966025352478}]"
