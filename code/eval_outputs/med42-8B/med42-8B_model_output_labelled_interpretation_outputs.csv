Randomized trial of fenretinide to prevent second breast malignancy in women with early breast cancer",J Natl Cancer Inst,"Background:
Treatment A has been shown to inhibit breast carcinogenesis in preclinical studies. We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.
Methods:
We randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30‐70 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66‐1.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64‐1.09; P = .177) between the two arms. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs (38 in the treatment A arm versus 40 in the control arm), incidence of distant metastasis (HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.79‐1.22; P = .858), and all‐cause mortality (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.92‐1.48; P = .215).
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than no treatment in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.",no_spin,2,2,"[{'token': 17, 'token_string': '2', 'logits': -0.752055823802948, 'probability': 0.47139647603034973}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.003544241189956665, 'probability': 0.9964619874954224}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",9,9,"[{'token': 24, 'token_string': '9', 'logits': -0.5277178287506104, 'probability': 0.5899497866630554}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.004290305078029633, 'probability': 0.9957188963890076}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.7586088180541992, 'probability': 0.4683174788951874}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.005255573429167271, 'probability': 0.9947582483291626}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.0033905506134033, 'probability': 0.36663421988487244}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.014673410914838314, 'probability': 0.9854337573051453}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",2,2,"[{'token': 17, 'token_string': '2', 'logits': -1.2280027866363525, 'probability': 0.2928769290447235}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.006825702264904976, 'probability': 0.993197500705719}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]"

The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (P =.642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (P =.177) between the two arms. However, an interaction was detected between treatment A and menopausal status in both outcomes (P for interaction in both outcomes =.045), with a possible beneficial effect in premenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66, and 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.41‐1.07; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 0.65, and 95% CI = 0.46‐0. 92) and an opposite effect in postmenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.32, and 95% CI = 0.82‐2.15; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.19, and 95% CI = 0.75‐1. 89). There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs, incidence of distant metastasis, and all‐cause mortality.

It is uncertain whether treatment A provides additional benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. This trial was initiated to explore this question.
Patients and methods:
Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization. The two end points of interest for this study were time to treatment failure (TTF) and survival time.
Results:
Median survival was 30.0 months for chemotherapy alone and 29.3 months treatment A and chemotherapy, p=0.834. Time to treatment failure (TTF) was 13.4 months for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with 10.3 month for chemotherapy alone patients (P = .087). The response rates (complete response and partial response) was 69.2% of for patients who received chemotherapy alone and 68.9% for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy, P =.99.

Efficacy and safety of treatment A was compared with comparator B in a group of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, without previous systemic therapy for advanced breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
The study was a prospective double‐blind randomized trial. All treated patients presented with positive estrogen receptors. Main end points were response rates, toxicity profile analysis, time to progression and survival. WHO and ECOG criteria were employed for response evaluation while toxicity was assessed according to WHO guidelines. Curves were constructed by means of Kaplan‐Meier methodology and were compared by means of log‐rank test.
Results:

To compare the efficacy and tolerability of treatment A with comparator B in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in patients whose disease progresses on prior endocrine treatment.
Patients and methods:
In this double‐blind, double‐dummy, parallel‐group study, postmenopausal patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP). Secondary end points included time to treatment failure (TTF), objective response (OR) rate, duration of response (DOR), and tolerability.
Results:
Patients (n = 400) were followed for a median period of 16.8 months.

Patients and methods:
From June 1997 until November 2000, 604 patients with T1‐3N1M0 or T3N0M0 tumors were randomized to three cycles of epirubicin 110 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of treatment A followed by three cycles of 'intensified' CMF (cyclophosphamide 840 mg/m2, methotrexate 47 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 840 mg/m2) (group A), or to four cycles of epirubicin followed by four cycles of CMF, as in group A (group B).

A total of 595 patients were eligible. Median follow‐up was 61.7 months for group A and 62 months for group B. The 3‐year DFS was 80% in group A and 77% in group B. Survival rates were 93% and 90%, respectively. The effect of treatment on the hazard of death was different according to hormonal receptor status. More specifically, in patients with negative receptor status the hazard of death was significantly higher for group B (hazard ratio 2.42). Both regimens were well tolerated and severe acute side‐effects were infrequent. No cases of severe cardiotoxicity or acute leukemia were recorded.
Conclusion:
The present study failed to demonstrate a significant difference in DFS or OS between the two treatment groups. However, our study has shown clearly that treatment A can be safely incorporated to dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy.",spin,5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -0.4854217767715454, 'probability': 0.6154375672340393}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.004647050518542528, 'probability': 0.995363712310791}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.4801945090293884, 'probability': 0.6186630725860596}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.004849101882427931, 'probability': 0.9951626658439636}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -0.5641770362854004, 'probability': 0.5688281059265137}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0036297645419836044, 'probability': 0.9963768720626831}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.0311380624771118, 'probability': 0.35660091042518616}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.02063964493572712, 'probability': 0.9795719385147095}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.6868380904197693, 'probability': 0.503164529800415}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.006117192097008228, 'probability': 0.9939014911651611}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]"
51,16314619,Phase III study of efaproxiral as an adjunct to whole-brain radiation therapy for brain metastases,J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
To determine whether treatment A, improves survival in patients with brain metastases when used as an adjunct to whole‐brain radiation therapy (WBRT).
Patients and methods:
Patients with brain metastases from solid tumors and a Karnofsky performance score of > or = 70 were randomly assigned to receive WBRT with supplemental oxygen and either treatment A (treatment A arm) or no treatment (control arm). The primary end point was survival.
Results:
The study consisted of 515 eligible patients (treatment A arm, n = 265; control arm, n = 250). The median survival time (MST) was 5.4 months for the treatment A arm versus 4.4 months for the control arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87; P = .16). For the subgroup of patients with non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or breast cancer, the MST was 6.0 and 4.4 months, respectively (HR = 0.82; P = .07). Cox multiple regression analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of death for the treatment A arm in both primary populations. Further analysis indicated that the benefit may be restricted to the subgroup of patients with breast cancer. Response rates (radiographic complete response plus partial response) improved by 7% (P = .10) and 13% (P = .01) for all patients and for NSCLC and breast cancer patients in the treatment A arm, respectively. The most common severe adverse event in patients treated with treatment A was hypoxemia, which was reversible and effectively managed with supplemental oxygen in most patients.

The addition of treatment A to WBRT may improve response rates and survival in patients with brain metastases, particularly metastases from breast cancer.

To compare treatment A and comparator B in node‐positive, operable breast cancer patients.
Methods and materials:
This was a randomized, multicenter, phase III trial enrolling 638 eligible women with prior breast surgery and positive axillary dissection. Patients in Arm A received treatment A, with concomitant radiotherapy (50 Gy +/‐ 10‐20‐Gy boost). Patients in Arm B received comparator B, with subsequent radiotherapy.
Results:
Median treatment durations were 64 and 126 days (Arms A and B, respectively), with no significant difference in overall or disease‐free survival. Five‐year locoregional relapse‐free survival favored patients with conservative surgery (two thirds of the population), with less local and / or regional recurrence in Arm A than in Arm B (3% vs. 9%; p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis in this subgroup showed a 2.8‐fold increased risk of locoregional recurrence with comparator B, independent of other prognostic factors (p = 0.027). Febrile neutropenia and Grade 3‐4 leukopenia were significantly more frequent in Arm A. Subclinical left ventricular ejection fraction events at 1 year were more frequent with treatment A (p = 0.02).

Patients and methods:
Between March 1991 and June 1999, 1863 women with stages I‐IIIA operable breast cancer who had undergone surgery and completed six cycles of adjuvant combination chemotherapy with either CMF, CAF, CEF, FAC or FEC were randomized to receive either treatment A for 3 years or no further treatment. Irrespective of menstrual status and hormone receptor content of the primary tumor, patients were stratified by institute, chemotherapy scheme and age (above 50 years or younger). The main end‐point was to detect a 5% increase in the 5 year survival (from 80% to 85%) in favor of treatment A. Secondary end‐ points were relapse free survival (RFS), local control, incidence of second primary breast cancer.
Results:
After exclusion of all patients from three sites because of inadequate documentation, a total of 1724 patients (93%) were analyzed (Treatment A 861 and Control 863).

Secondary end‐ points were relapse free survival (RFS), local control, incidence of second primary breast cancer and correlation of results with hormone receptor content.
Results:
After exclusion of all patients from three sites because of inadequate documentation, a total of 1724 patients (93%) were analyzed (Treatment A 861 and Control 863). At a median follow‐up of 6.5 years, 5‐year RFS on treatment A was 73% versus 67% in controls (p=0.035). No difference was seen in overall survival. The benefit of treatment A was mainly seen in the subgroup of patients with histologically documented positive axillary nodes (5‐year RFS on treatment A 71% versus 64% in the control group, p=0.044) and in patients with tumours expressing the ER and PR positive phenotype (5‐year RFS on treatment A 77% versus 70% in the control group, p=0.014).
Conclusion:
Treatment A administered for 3 years after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy in this otherwise unselected group of patients for endocrine sensitivity had a limited impact on relapse and had no detectable effect on overall survival. The beneficial effect of treatment A is mainly confined to the subgroup of patients with node‐positive disease and to patients with tumours expressing the ER and PR positive phenotype.",spin,6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.5442323684692383, 'probability': 0.5802870988845825}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.005807668901979923, 'probability': 0.9942092299461365}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.5423029065132141, 'probability': 0.5814077854156494}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0052475095726549625, 'probability': 0.9947661757469177}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -0.6164970397949219, 'probability': 0.5398321747779846}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.003867528634145856, 'probability': 0.9961399435997009}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.1328659057617188, 'probability': 0.32210877537727356}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.006838134024292231, 'probability': 0.9931852221488953}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.97528475522995, 'probability': 0.3770849406719208}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.005159515421837568, 'probability': 0.9948537349700928}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]"
1,17173959,Effective cervical neoplasia detection with a novel optical detection system: a randomized trial,Gynecol Oncol,"Objective:
To assess whether the use of intervention A as an adjunct to colposcopy increases the detection of biopsy confirmed CIN 2, 3 (high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia).
Methods:
This is a multicenter two‐arm randomized trial comparing colposcopy alone with colposcopy plus intervention A. Patients were recruited from 13 colposcopy clinics in a variety of practice settings. 2299 women referred for the evaluation of an abnormal cervical cytology were randomized with stratification by cytology; subsequently 113 women were excluded for a variety of reasons. The main study outcomes were differences in true‐positive rates (CIN 2, 3 and cancer identified) and false‐positive rates between the study arms.
Results:
The true‐positive (TP) rates were 14.4% vs. 11.4% (p=0.035, one‐sided) for the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm compared to colposcopy‐only arm, respectively, in women with either an atypical squamous cell (ASC) or low‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) cytology result. TP rates were similar between the two arms among women referred for the evaluation of HSIL (high‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). The 26.5% gain in true‐positives observed with the use of intervention A and colposcopy among women referred for an ASC or LSIL cytology was achieved with only a fractional increase in number of biopsies obtained per patient (0.30) and a modest increase in false‐positive rate
(4%). In the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm among women with ASC or LSIL, the PPV (positive predictive value) of biopsies indicated by ntervention A was 15.0% and the PPV of biopsies indicated by colposcopy was 15.2%. Joint hypothesis testing indicates that intervention A and colposcopy provides benefit compared to colposcopy alone among women with ASC or LSIL.
Conclusion:
Combining intervention A with colposcopy provides a clinically meaningful increase in the detection of CIN 2, 3 in women referred for the evaluation of mildly abnormal cytology results.",spin,8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.39765846729278564, 'probability': 0.6718915104866028}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0035703741014003754, 'probability': 0.9964359998703003}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",9,9,"[{'token': 24, 'token_string': '9', 'logits': -0.4210458993911743, 'probability': 0.6563599705696106}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00411722669377923, 'probability': 0.9958913326263428}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.37854334712028503, 'probability': 0.6848583221435547}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.005097724962979555, 'probability': 0.9949151873588562}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.8181499242782593, 'probability': 0.44124722480773926}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0054494403302669525, 'probability': 0.9945654273033142}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.48479294776916504, 'probability': 0.6158246994018555}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.004520791582763195, 'probability': 0.9954893589019775}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]"

53,17264336,Phase III trial of concurrent or sequential adjuvant chemoradiotherapy after conservative surgery for early-stage breast cancer: final results of the ARCOSEIN trial,J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
In 1996, we initiated the multicenter phase III randomized trial to compare the effect on disease‐free survival (DFS) of experimental treatment A versus comparator B after breast‐conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer. This report presents the clinical results with a median follow‐up of 60 months.
Patients and methods:
Between February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery.
Results:
There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5‐year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis‐free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76). Nevertheless, in the node‐positive subgroup, the 5‐year LRFS was statistically better in the treatment A arm (97% in treatment A v 91% in comparator B; P = .02), corresponding to a risk of locoregional recurrence decreased by 39% (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.93).

54,17264336,Phase III trial of concurrent or sequential adjuvant chemoradiotherapy after conservative surgery for early-stage breast cancer: final results of the ARCOSEIN trial,J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
In 1996, we initiated the multicenter phase III randomized trial to compare the effect on disease‐free survival (DFS) of experimental treatment A versus comparator B after breast‐conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer. This report presents the clinical results with a median follow‐up of 60 months.
Patients and methods:
Between February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial (358 randomized to comparator B and 358 to treatment A) and respectively 343 and 352 patients were included in the analysis. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery. The primary endpoint was disease‐free survival (DFS) defined as the time from randomization to the first treatment failure (in the ipsilateral breast, in the axillary/infraclavicular/IMCs, or at a distant site) or death (if no recurrence had been noted).
Results:
There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5‐year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis‐free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76).

17,18955454,"Phase III, double-blind, randomized study comparing lapatinib plus paclitaxel with placebo plus paclitaxel as first-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer",J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
Treatment A is effective against HER‐2‐positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy of treatment A in HER‐2‐negative and HER‐2‐uncharacterized MBC.
Patients and methods:
Women with MBC were randomly assigned to first‐line therapy with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks plus treatment A or placebo. A preplanned retrospective evaluation of HER‐2 status was performed using fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP); secondary end points were objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), event‐free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS).
Results:
In the intent‐to‐treat population (n = 579), there were no significant differences in TTP, EFS, or OS between treatment arms, although differences in ORR and CBR were noted. In 86 HER‐2‐positive patients (15%), treatment with paclitaxel‐ treatment A resulted in statistically significant improvements in TTP, EFS, ORR, and CBR compared with paclitaxel‐placebo. No differences between treatment groups were observed for any end point in HER‐2‐negative patients. The most common adverse events were alopecia, rash, and diarrhea. The incidence of diarrhea and rash was significantly higher in the paclitaxel‐treatment A arm. The rate of cardiac events was low, and no difference was observed between treatment arms.
Conclusion:

18,18955454,"Phase III, double-blind, randomized study comparing lapatinib plus paclitaxel with placebo plus paclitaxel as first-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer",J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy of treatment A in locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC).
Patients and methods:
Women with MBC were randomly assigned to first‐line therapy with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks plus treatment A or placebo. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP); secondary end points were objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), event‐free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS).
Results:
This trial enrolled 580 patients. In the intent‐to‐treat population (n = 579), there were no statistical significant differences between treatment A+paclitaxel and placebo+paclitaxel in TTP (29 v 22.9 weeks, HR = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.05; p = .142), EFS (25.1 vs. 22.6 weeks, HR = 0.90 [0.75‐1.08], p = 0.238), or OS (99.1 vs. 87 weeks, HR = 0.86 [0.7‐1.1], p = 0.216). The ORR and CBR were respectively for treatment A and placebo 35.1% vs. 25.3%, p = 0.008 and 40.5% vs. 31.9%, p = 0.025. The most common adverse events were alopecia, rash, and diarrhea. The incidence of diarrhea, rash, mucositis, and vomiting was significantly higher in the paclitaxel‐treatment A arm. The rate of cardiac events was low, and no statistical difference was observed between treatment arms. AEs led to treatment discontinuation in 48 patients (16%) in the paclitaxel‐treatment A arm compared with 20 patients (7%) in the paclitaxel‐placebo arm.

This phase III study compared the efficacy and safety of treatment A with comparator B in advanced breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
Patients were randomly assigned to treatment A or comparator B. Comparison of progression‐free survival (PFS) was the primary objective.
Results:
Patient characteristics were balanced between arms (N = 305). Median PFS was 8.05 months (95% CI, 6.60 to 8.71) for treatment A and 7.98 (95% CI, 6.93 to 8.77) for comparator B (log‐rank P = .121).

Many cancer patients continue to smoke postdiagnosis, yet there have been few smoking cessation trials for this population. Depression, which is prevalent among cancer patients, may be a barrier to cessation.
Methods:
This double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial randomized 246 cancer patients to 9 weeks of placebo or treatment A, stratifying by pre‐treatment depression symptoms.

This was an open‐label randomized trial undertaken in 50 centres across eight countries. 1006 treatment‐naive patients diagnosed with advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma were randomly allocated (1 to 1) by minimization to receive comparator B or treatment A. Treatment was not masked. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Treatment groups were compared with a non‐stratified log‐ rank test. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN XXXX.
Findings:
502 patients were randomly assigned to receive comparator B and 504 to receive combined treatment A. Median follow‐up was 37.2 months (24.8‐52.3). Median overall survival was 18.8 months (17.0‐23.2) for patients receiving comparator B versus 18.6 months (16.5‐20.6) for those receiving treatment A. Overall survival did not differ between the two groups (hazard ratio 1.05 [95% CI 0.90‐1.21], p=0.55; absolute difference 0.3% (‐5.1 to 5.6) at 1 year and 2.7% (‐8.2 to 2.9) at 3 years). Serious adverse events were reported in 113 (23%) patients receiving comparator B and 131 (26%) of those receiving combined treatment A.
Interpretation:
Although treatment A does not improve overall or progression‐free survival compared with comparator B, treatment A might still have a role because it can produce remissions that are of clinically relevant length in some patients.

The authors conducted a multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐ controlled, phase 3, clinical trial to examine the effect of treatment A on patient‐ reported fatigue in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. A sample of 877 cancer patients beginning chemotherapy at 23 geographically separate University of Rochester Cancer Center (URCC) Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) affiliates were assessed for fatigue. Patients who reported fatigue (N = 867) were randomly assigned to receive either treatment A or a placebo. Treatment began on Day 5 of Cycle 2 and ended after Day 7 of Cycle 4. Fatigue, sleepiness and depression were assessed during Cycles 2 to 4 by using psychometrically valid measures. The primary outcome was the worst level of cancer related fatigue during the previous week at Cycle 4. Group differences (treatment vs. placebo) were examined by using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusting for baseline fatigue (Cycle 2).
Results:
There were 631 patients (315 treatment A, 316 placebo) who provided evaluable data and were analyzed. There was no statistical significant difference for the worst level of cancer related fatigue between treatment A (mean (SE) = 6.87 (0.14) and placebo (mean (SE) = 7.09 (0.13); p = 0.08. Sleepiness was statistically significantly higher in placebo (mean (SE) = 18.38 (0.31) vs. treatment A (mean (SE) = 16.82 (0.26); p = 0.002. Treatment A had no statistically significant effect on depression (p=0.87)
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than placebo in controlling cancer‐related fatigue.",no_spin,4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.8450679183006287, 'probability': 0.42952820658683777}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.004915297031402588, 'probability': 0.995096743106842}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.583139955997467, 'probability': 0.5581430196762085}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.00591231556609273, 'probability': 0.9941051602363586}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",6,6,"[{'token': 21, 'token_string': '6', 'logits': -0.7311502695083618, 'probability': 0.4813550114631653}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.007236815523356199, 'probability': 0.9927893280982971}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.4141016006469727, 'probability': 0.2431439459323883}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.009449871256947517, 'probability': 0.9905946254730225}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -1.0384362936019897, 'probability': 0.3540077805519104}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.006675917189568281, 'probability': 0.9933462142944336}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]"

The primary end point was progression‐free survival (PFS). Other end points were objective response rate and safety. The study was originally planned for 244 patients. The trial was temporarily placed on hold after 125 patients were randomized while the results of another trial were being reviewed and the sponsor decided not to resume enrollment. The interim analysis became the final analysis.
Results:
The median PFS was 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD (n = 65) versus 3.7 months for PLD (n = 60) (hazards ratio, 0.92; P = 0.7243). A preplanned subgroup analysis showed that 75 patients with platinum‐refractory or primary platinum‐resistant OC had a median PFS of 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD versus 2.9 months for PLD (hazards ratio, 0.55; P = 0.0425). Hematologic adverse events were 66% on the treatment A + PLD arm versus 44% on the PLD arm, manageable with dose reductions. Nonhematologic adverse events were similar for both arms. The incidence of palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis was lower on treatment A + PLD (23%, 31%, respectively) versus (39%, 49%, respectively) on PLD.
Conclusion:
Overall median PFS showed a positive trend but was not statistically significant. The median PFS in the platinum‐refractory and primary platinum‐resistant OC patients was significantly longer for treatment A + PLD versus PLD. Treatment A may ameliorate the palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis known to be associated with PLD.

This phase III trial assesses whether treatment A increases the duration of functional independence after surgery or radiosurgery of brain metastases.
Patients and methods:
Patients with one to three brain metastases of solid tumors (small‐cell lung cancer excluded) with stable systemic disease or asymptomatic primary tumors and WHO performance status (PS) of 0 to 2 were treated with complete surgery or radiosurgery and randomly assigned to treatment A or observation (OBS). The primary end point was time to WHO PS deterioration to more than 2.
Results:
Of 359 patients, 199 underwent radiosurgery, and 160 underwent surgery. In the radiosurgery group, 100 patients were allocated to OBS, and 99 were allocated to treatment A. After surgery, 79 patients were allocated to OBS, and 81 were allocated to treatment A. The median time to WHO PS more than 2 was 10.0 months (95% CI, 8.1 to 11.7 months) after OBS and 9.5 months (95% CI, 7.8 to 11.9 months) after treatment A (P = .71). Overall survival was similar in the treatment A and OBS arms (median, 10.9 v 10.7 months, respectively; P = .89). Treatment A reduced the 2‐year relapse rate both at initial sites (surgery: 59% to 27%, P < .001; radiosurgery: 31% to 19%, P = .040) and at new sites (surgery: 42% to 23%, P = .008; radiosurgery: 48% to 33%, P = .023). Salvage therapies were used more frequently after OBS than after treatment A.

We examined the value of treatment A in a phase III trial with strict preoperative staging and surgical resection guidelines.
Patients and methods:
Patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagogastric junction (AEG II and III) were randomly assigned to treatment A followed by surgery or to surgery alone. To detect with 80% power an improvement in median survival from 17 months with surgery alone to 24 months with treatment A, 282 events were required.
Results:
This trial was stopped for poor accrual after 144 patients were randomly assigned (72:72); 52.8% patients had tumors located in the proximal third of the stomach, including AEG type II and III. The International Union against Cancer R0 resection rate was 81.9% after treatment A as compared with 66.7% with surgery alone (P = .036).

High levels of distress and need for self‐care information by patients commencing chemotherapy suggest that current prechemotherapy education is suboptimal. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of a prechemotherapy education intervention (treatment A) to assess impact on patient distress, treatment‐related concerns, and the prevalence and severity of and bother caused by six chemotherapy side‐effects.
Patients and methods:
One hundred and ninety‐two breast, gastrointestinal, and haematologic cancer patients were recruited before the trial closing prematurely (original target 352). Treatment A was administered before first treatment (intervention 1), 48 h after first treatment (intervention 2), and immediately before second treatment (intervention 3). Patient outcomes were measured at baseline (T1: pre‐education) and immediately preceding treatment cycles 1 (T2) and 3 (T3).
Results:
Treatment A did not significantly reduce patient distress. However, a significant decrease in sensory/psychological (P=0.027) and procedural (P=0.03) concerns, as well as prevalence and severity of and bother due to vomiting (all P=0.001), were observed at T3. In addition, subgroup analysis of patients with elevated distress at T1 indicated a significant decrease (P=0.035) at T2 but not at T3 (P=0.055) in treatment A patients.

Treatment A, has activity alone and in combination with docetaxel (Taxotere) and prednisone (DP) in metastatic castration‐resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). A randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled phase II trial compared DP combined with either treatment A (A) or placebo in chemonaive mCRPC.
Patients and methods:
Men with progressive mCRPC despite androgen deprivation were eligible and randomized 1:1.

Two hundred and twenty‐one patients were randomly assigned.

Men with progressive mCRPC despite androgen deprivation were eligible and randomized 1:1. Patients received docetaxel (75 mg/m2 day 1) and prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily every 21 days with either treatment A or placebo twice daily orally on days 1‐3. The primary end point was overall survival (OS).
Results:
Two hundred and twenty‐one patients were randomly assigned. Median OS for treatment A plus docetaxel‐prednisone (ADP) and placebo‐DP was 18.1 versus 17.8 months [hazard ratio (HR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.72‐1.55, P=0.63]. Secondary end points were also not statistically different. Grade 3/4 toxic effects for ADP versus placebo‐DP were cardiac events (5% versus 2%), lymphopenia (23% versus 16%), neutropenia (47% versus 40%), ileus (2% versus 0%) and pulmonary embolism (6% versus 2%). In a subgroup of high‐risk mCRPC (n=34), outcomes appeared to favor ADP (median OS 19 versus 14 months).
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than placebo in metastatic castration‐ resistant prostate cancer patients.",no_spin,2,2,"[{'token': 17, 'token_string': '2', 'logits': -0.9234164357185364, 'probability': 0.3971598446369171}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.003888428211212158, 'probability': 0.9961190819740295}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.5259318351745605, 'probability': 0.5910044312477112}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.004260985646396875, 'probability': 0.9957481026649475}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.8555865287780762, 'probability': 0.4250337779521942}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.004844593815505505, 'probability': 0.9951671361923218}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",5,5,"[{'token': 20, 'token_string': '5', 'logits': -1.041414499282837, 'probability': 0.35295507311820984}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.011498725041747093, 'probability': 0.9885671138763428}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",4,4,"[{'token': 19, 'token_string': '4', 'logits': -0.8125410676002502, 'probability': 0.443729043006897}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.006150366738438606, 'probability': 0.9938685894012451}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]"

A phase III study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) to evaluate the effect on response rate and survival of a treatment A.
Patients and methods:
Four hundred fifty‐six patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B in combination with 5‐FU (500 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) i.v., every 21 days for a maximum of six cycles (eight in case of CR).
Results:
Of 456 patients, 390 were evaluable for efficacy. Objective response (CR + PR) was seen in 57% (treatment A) vs. 41% (comparator B) of the evaluable patients (P = 0.003). The CR rate was higher in the treatment A arm (12% vs. 7%, P = 0.07). Treatment A produced significantly higher response rates in patients with visceral localization (50% vs. 34%, P = 0.011) and in patients with more than two metastatic organ sites (64% vs. 37%, P = 0.001). Median time to progression (7.6 vs. 7 months) and overall survival (18 months vs. 17 months) were similar. Myelosuppression was the principal toxic effect, with grade IV neutropenia observed in 57% of the patients treated with treatment A vs. 9% of those on comparator B. Grade IV infection or febrile neutropenia were observed in 8% (treatment A) vs. 0.4% (comparator B), but the incidence of septic death was the same in the two arms (two patients each). Cardiac toxicity was similar in the two treatment groups, with 5% vs. 3% of the patients taken off study due to cardiac events, primarily due to a decline in LVEF. Only three patients (two in treatment A) experienced congestive heart failure.
Conclusion:
This trial shows that treatment A can be administered for repeated cycles without bone marrow support with increased, though acceptable, toxicity and with a significant increase of antitumor effect (especially in visceral and/or high‐burden disease), but no increased survival.",spin,7,7,"[{'token': 22, 'token_string': '7', 'logits': -0.5213637351989746, 'probability': 0.5937103629112244}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0039597926661372185, 'probability': 0.9960480332374573}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",9,9,"[{'token': 24, 'token_string': '9', 'logits': -0.6742441058158875, 'probability': 0.5095414519309998}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0027185645885765553, 'probability': 0.9972851276397705}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.40505343675613403, 'probability': 0.6669411659240723}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.0031355286482721567, 'probability': 0.9968693852424622}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.9154328107833862, 'probability': 0.40034329891204834}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.003593774512410164, 'probability': 0.9964126348495483}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]",8,8,"[{'token': 23, 'token_string': '8', 'logits': -0.5322421789169312, 'probability': 0.5872867107391357}, {'token': 128009, 'token_string': '<|eot_id|>', 'logits': -0.003218353958800435, 'probability': 0.996786892414093}, {'token': 128001, 'token_string': '<|end_of_text|>', 'logits': 0.0, 'probability': 1.0}]"
