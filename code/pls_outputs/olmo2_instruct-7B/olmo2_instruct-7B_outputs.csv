Randomized trial of fenretinide to prevent second breast malignancy in women with early breast cancer",J Natl Cancer Inst,"Background:
Treatment A has been shown to inhibit breast carcinogenesis in preclinical studies. We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.
Methods:
We randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30‐70 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66‐1.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64‐1.09; P = .177) between the two arms. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs (38 in the treatment A arm versus 40 in the control arm), incidence of distant metastasis (HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.79‐1.22; P = .858), and all‐cause mortality (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.92‐1.48; P = .215).
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than no treatment in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.",no_spin,"Sure, let's break it down into simpler terms:

Imagine there's a special medicine called Treatment A that scientists think might stop breast cancer from coming back in the other breast. They wanted to see if this medicine really works.

They took 2972 women who had breast cancer or a type of breast cancer that hadn't spread (ductal carcinoma in situ). These women were divided into two groups: one group got the Treatment A every day for 5 years (1496 women), and the other group didn't get any treatment (1476 women).

The scientists watched both groups for 7 years to see if breast cancer came back in the other breast. They also checked for cancer in other parts of the body and if the cancer spread to distant places, and they looked at how many people died from any cause.

After looking at all the data, the scientists found that Treatment A didn't make a big difference. There were almost the same number of women who got breast cancer in the other breast in both groups. Also, there were no big differences in cancer spreading to other parts of the body or in how many people died.

So, based on this study, Treatment A didn't seem to be better than not taking any medicine at all for stopping breast cancer from coming back in the other breast.

In simple terms: Treatment A didn't help stop breast cancer from coming back in the other breast better than doing nothing."

At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (P =.642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (P =.177) between the two arms. However, an interaction was detected between treatment A and menopausal status in both outcomes (P for interaction in both outcomes =.045), with a possible beneficial effect in premenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66, and 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.41‐1.07; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 0.65, and 95% CI = 0.46‐0. 92) and an opposite effect in postmenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.32, and 95% CI = 0.82‐2.15; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.19, and 95% CI = 0.75‐1. 89). There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs, incidence of distant metastasis, and all‐cause mortality.

Imagine there's a special medicine called Treatment A that scientists think can stop breast cancer from coming back in the other breast. They wanted to see if this medicine really works in real life, not just in tests.

They took 2972 women who had breast cancer or a type of breast cancer that hadn't spread (ductal carcinoma in situ). Half of these women took the medicine every day for 5 years, and the other half didn't take anything. They watched these women for 7 years to see if breast cancer came back in the same breast or the other breast.

After watching for a long time (97 months, which is about 8 years), they found that the medicine didn't make a big difference in stopping breast cancer from coming back in either breast. It didn't work as well as they hoped for everyone.

But, they noticed something interesting: for women who were still having periods (premenopausal), the medicine seemed to help a little. It made it less likely for breast cancer to come back in the other breast (the contralateral breast). However, for women who had stopped having periods (postmenopausal), the medicine didn't help and might have even made it slightly more likely for breast cancer to come back in the other breast.

The scientists said that their findings are just the beginning. They need to do more studies to be sure if the"

It is uncertain whether treatment A provides additional benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. This trial was initiated to explore this question.
Patients and methods:
Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization. The two end points of interest for this study were time to treatment failure (TTF) and survival time.
Results:
Median survival was 30.0 months for chemotherapy alone and 29.3 months treatment A and chemotherapy, p=0.834. Time to treatment failure (TTF) was 13.4 months for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with 10.3 month for chemotherapy alone patients (P = .087).

**What the passage is about:**
The passage is talking about a study that was done to see if using a special treatment (called treatment A) along with regular chemotherapy is better than just using chemotherapy alone for people with a type of cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (called metastatic breast cancer).

**What they did:**
They took 231 people with this type of cancer and divided them into two groups. One group got just chemotherapy, and the other group got chemotherapy plus the special treatment A. They did this study from January 1988 to December 1992.

**What they found:**
- Both groups lived about the same amount of time before their cancer got worse (this is called ""time to treatment failure"" or TTF). For chemotherapy alone, it was 10.3 months, and for chemotherapy plus treatment A, it was 13.4 months. The difference wasn't big enough to say one was better than the other (p=0.834).
- About 69% to 68% of people in each group got better (either completely or partially) from the treatment, which means there wasn't a big difference in how well the treatments worked.
- There were some side effects (toxicities) from the treatments, but there wasn't a big difference between the two groups.

Patients and methods:
Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with estrogen receptor (ER)‐positive or ER‐unknown metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization.
Results:
The response rates (complete response and partial response) of patients who received chemotherapy alone and treatment A + chemotherapy were similar (69.2% v 68.9%, respectively; P =.99). Time to treatment failure (TTF) was slightly longer for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone patients (13.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.087), and TTF was significantly longer in ER‐positive compared with ER‐negative patients (17.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.048). However, ER status had no effect on overall survival (30.0 months for chemotherapy alone v 29.3 months for treatment A + chemotherapy).
Conclusion:

Imagine there's a new medicine called ""Treatment A"" that some doctors think might work better than just regular chemotherapy when treating breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. This new medicine is being tested to see if it really helps more than just chemotherapy alone.

In this study, they took 231 women with a type of breast cancer that might respond to hormones (called estrogen receptor-positive or ER-unknown) and divided them into two groups. One group got just chemotherapy, and the other group got chemotherapy plus the new medicine ""Treatment A.""

After giving the treatments, they looked at how well they worked by checking how many women got better (had a complete or partial response). They found that both treatments worked about the same (69.2% for chemotherapy alone and 68.9% for chemotherapy plus Treatment A).

They also looked at how long the treatments lasted before the cancer got worse again (called Time to Treatment Failure or TTF). Treatment A plus chemotherapy worked a little longer for women whose cancer was ER-positive (about 13.4 months compared to 10.3 months for just chemotherapy).

But here's the important part: even though Treatment A plus chemotherapy worked a bit longer for ER-positive women, it didn't make them live longer overall. The study showed that for all the women, whether they got just chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus Treatment A,"

Efficacy and safety of treatment A was compared with comparator B in a group of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, without previous systemic therapy for advanced breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
The study was a prospective double‐blind randomized trial. All treated patients presented with positive estrogen receptors. Main end points were response rates, toxicity profile analysis, time to progression and survival. WHO and ECOG criteria were employed for response evaluation while toxicity was assessed according to WHO guidelines. Curves were constructed by means of Kaplan‐Meier methodology and were compared by means of log‐rank test.
Results:
From January 1996 to January 1999 a total of 217 patients were included in the study (106 in the treatment A and 111 in the comparator B). Both groups of patients were homogeneous regarding the main prognostic factors. A response rate of 64% (68/106) was observed in the treatment A group as compared with a 52% (58/111) in the comparator B group. Median times to progression and overall survival were not significantly different. A lower incidence of undesirable effects was appreciated in the treatment A arm.

**What the passage is about:**
The passage is about a study that compared two different treatments (A and B) for women with a type of breast cancer called ""advanced breast cancer."" This kind of cancer has spread beyond the breast and nearby tissues. The women in the study had already gone through menopause (which means they no longer have their monthly periods) and their cancer was sensitive to hormones (specifically estrogen).

**What they did:**
The researchers did a special kind of study called a ""prospective double-blind randomized trial."" This means they carefully chose women with the same type of breast cancer and randomly assigned them to get either treatment A or treatment B. Neither the patients nor the doctors knew who was getting which treatment to avoid any bias.

**What they measured:**
They looked at a few important things:

1. **Response rates:** This means how many women's cancers got better (or ""responded"") after getting the treatment.
2. **Toxicity profile analysis:** This is about how many side effects the treatments caused.
3. **Time to progression:** This is how long it took for the cancer to get worse again after starting the treatment.
4. **Survival:** This is how long the women lived after starting the treatment.

**What the passage is about:**
The passage is about a study that compared two different treatments (let's call them Treatment A and Treatment B) for women who have advanced breast cancer and are past menopause. These women hadn't received any other treatments for their cancer before this study.

**How the study was done:**
The study was set up to follow the patients over time to see how well each treatment worked. It was designed so that neither the patients nor the people giving the treatments knew which treatment was being given (this is called a ""double-blind randomized trial""). All the patients in the study had cancer that was positive for estrogen receptors, which is a type of marker that helps doctors understand the cancer better.

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy with or without treatment A primarily on disease‐free survival (DFS) and secondarily on overall survival (OS) in patients with high‐risk operable breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
From June 1997 until November 2000, 604 patients with T1‐3N1M0 or T3N0M0 tumors were randomized to three cycles of epirubicin 110 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of treatment A followed by three cycles of 'intensified' CMF (cyclophosphamide 840 mg/m2, methotrexate 47 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 840 mg/m2) (group A), or to four cycles of epirubicin followed by four cycles of CMF, as in group A (group B). All cycles were given every 2 weeks with granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor support.

Survival rates were 93% and 90%, respectively. Comparison of quality of life outcomes between the two groups showed no statistically significant differences. Both regimens were well tolerated and severe acute side‐effects were infrequent. No cases of severe cardiotoxicity or acute leukemia were recorded.
Conclusion:
Treatment A with a dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy was not more effective than a dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy alone in patients with high‐risk operable breast cancer.",no_spin,"Sure, let's break it down into simpler terms:

Imagine there was a big study where doctors wanted to see if giving extra strong medicine (called chemotherapy) to people with a certain type of breast cancer (called high-risk operable breast cancer) would help them live longer. This special medicine was given in two big doses, with a break in between, and sometimes it was combined with another type of medicine (called Treatment A).

The study was done from June 1997 to November 2000, and they looked at 604 patients. These patients were divided into two groups. The first group got three doses of one medicine (epirubicin) followed by three doses of Treatment A, and then three more doses of a strong combination of three other medicines (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil). The second group got the same three doses of epirubicin but then received four doses of the same strong combination of medicines.

After giving all the medicine, they checked how long the patients lived without their cancer coming back (this is called disease-free survival) and how long they lived in total (overall survival). The study found that both groups had similar results in terms of how long the patients lived and whether their cancer came back.

Three years after starting the treatment, 80% of the patients in the first group and 77% in the second group were still alive without their cancer"

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy with or without treatment A primarily on disease‐free survival (DFS) and secondarily on overall survival (OS) in patients with high‐risk operable breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
From June 1997 until November 2000, 604 patients with T1‐3N1M0 or T3N0M0 tumors were randomized to three cycles of epirubicin 110 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of treatment A followed by three cycles of 'intensified' CMF (cyclophosphamide 840 mg/m2, methotrexate 47 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 840 mg/m2) (group A), or to four cycles of epirubicin followed by four cycles of CMF, as in group A (group B). All cycles were given every 2 weeks with granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor support.
Results:
A total of 595 patients were eligible. Median follow‐up was 61.7 months for group A and 62 months for group B. The 3‐year DFS was 80% in group A and 77% in group B. Survival rates were 93% and 90%, respectively. The effect of treatment on the hazard of death was different according to hormonal receptor status. More specifically, in patients with negative receptor status the hazard of death was significantly higher for group B (hazard ratio 2.42). Both regimens were well tolerated and severe acute side‐effects were infrequent. No cases of severe cardiotoxicity or acute leukemia were recorded.
Conclusion:
The present study failed to demonstrate a significant difference in DFS or OS between the two treatment groups. However, our study has shown clearly that treatment A can be safely incorporated to dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy.",spin,"Sure, let's break it down into simpler terms:

Imagine there was a big research project where doctors wanted to see if giving extra strong medicine (dose-dense sequential chemotherapy) to people with a certain type of breast cancer (high-risk operable breast cancer) would help them live longer. They compared two different ways of giving this medicine:

1. **Group A**: First, the patients got a strong medicine called epirubicin for three doses, then they got another type of medicine (treatment A) for three doses, and finally, they got a combination of three more strong medicines (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil) for three doses.

2. **Group B**: The patients got epirubicin for four doses, followed by the same combination of three strong medicines for four doses.

The researchers watched the patients for a long time (61.7 months for Group A and 62 months for Group B) to see how long they lived without their cancer coming back (disease-free survival) and how long they lived in total (overall survival).

Here's what they found:

- Both groups had similar chances of living without their cancer coming back for 3 years (80% for Group A and 77% for Group B).
- About 93% of people in Group A and 90% in Group B were still alive after "

To determine whether treatment A, improves survival in patients with brain metastases when used as an adjunct to whole‐brain radiation therapy (WBRT).
Patients and methods:
Patients with brain metastases from solid tumors and a Karnofsky performance score of > or = 70 were randomly assigned to receive WBRT with supplemental oxygen and either treatment A (treatment A arm) or no treatment (control arm). The primary end point was survival.
Results:
The study consisted of 515 eligible patients (treatment A arm, n = 265; control arm, n = 250). The median survival time (MST) was 5.4 months for the treatment A arm versus 4.4 months for the control arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87; P = .16). For the subgroup of patients with non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or breast cancer, the MST was 6.0 and 4.4 months, respectively (HR = 0.82; P = .07). Cox multiple regression analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of death for the treatment A arm in both primary populations. Further analysis indicated that the benefit may be restricted to the subgroup of patients with breast cancer. Response rates (radiographic complete response plus partial response) improved by 7% (P = .10) and 13% (P = .01) for all patients and for NSCLC and breast cancer patients in the treatment A arm, respectively. The most common severe adverse event in patients treated with treatment A was hypoxemia, which was reversible and effectively managed with supplemental oxygen in most patients.
Conclusion:
The addition of treatment A to WBRT may improve response rates and survival in patients with brain metastases, particularly metastases from breast cancer. A confirmatory trial for breast cancer patients has been initiated.",spin,"Sure, let's break it down into simpler terms:

Imagine there are people who have cancer that has spread to their brain. This is called brain metastases. The doctors wanted to know if using a special treatment (called treatment A) along with a common treatment for brain metastases (whole-brain radiation therapy or WBRT) could help these people live longer.

They did a study with 515 people who had brain metastases from different types of cancer and were healthy enough to participate (their Karnofsky performance score was 70 or higher). Half of the people got WBRT with extra oxygen and the special treatment A, while the other half just got WBRT with extra oxygen (this is the control group).

The study found that, on average, people who got treatment A lived about 0.9 months longer than those who didn't (5.4 months vs. 4.4 months). This difference wasn't big enough to be sure it was because of treatment A, though (the chance, or P-value, was 0.16, which is not small enough to be statistically significant).

When they looked at people with lung cancer (non-small-cell lung cancer or NSCLC) or breast cancer separately, they saw a bigger difference. People with lung cancer lived 0.6 months longer, and people with breast cancer lived 1 month longer with treatment A.

The study also showed that more people"

To compare treatment A and comparator B in node‐positive, operable breast cancer patients.
Methods and materials:
This was a randomized, multicenter, phase III trial enrolling 638 eligible women with prior breast surgery and positive axillary dissection. Patients in Arm A received treatment A, with concomitant radiotherapy (50 Gy +/‐ 10‐20‐Gy boost). Patients in Arm B received comparator B, with subsequent radiotherapy.
Results:
Median treatment durations were 64 and 126 days (Arms A and B, respectively), with no significant difference in overall or disease‐free survival. Five‐year locoregional relapse‐free survival favored patients with conservative surgery (two thirds of the population), with less local and / or regional recurrence in Arm A than in Arm B (3% vs. 9%; p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis in this subgroup showed a 2.8‐fold increased risk of locoregional recurrence with comparator B, independent of other prognostic factors (p = 0.027). Febrile neutropenia and Grade 3‐4 leukopenia were significantly more frequent in Arm A. Subclinical left ventricular ejection fraction events at 1 year were more frequent with treatment A (p = 0.02).

- This treatment involves getting a specific amount of radiation (like a targeted dose) along with the main treatment.
- It's given to women in one group (Arm A).

**Comparator B:**
- This is the standard treatment that doctors usually give, and then they add radiation later.
- Women in this group (Arm B) receive this treatment.

- Both treatments took different amounts of time to complete. Treatment A was faster, taking around 64 days on average, while Comparator B took about 126 days.
- Even though both treatments took different amounts of time, they didn't find a big difference in how well they kept the cancer from coming back in the breast area or nearby (this is called ""overall or disease-free survival"").
- However, when they looked closer at the group that had conservative surgery (which means they didn't remove as much healthy tissue as possible), they saw that Treatment A was better. Only 3% of women in Arm A had their cancer come back in the breast area or nearby, compared to 9% in Arm B."

Patients and methods:
Between March 1991 and June 1999, 1863 women with stages I‐IIIA operable breast cancer who had undergone surgery and completed six cycles of adjuvant combination chemotherapy with either CMF, CAF, CEF, FAC or FEC were randomized to receive either treatment A for 3 years or no further treatment. Irrespective of menstrual status and hormone receptor content of the primary tumor, patients were stratified by institute, chemotherapy scheme and age (above 50 years or younger). The main end‐point was to detect a 5% increase in the 5 year survival (from 80% to 85%) in favor of treatment A. Secondary end‐ points were relapse free survival (RFS), local control, incidence of second primary breast cancer.
Results:
After exclusion of all patients from three sites because of inadequate documentation, a total of 1724 patients (93%) were analyzed (Treatment A 861 and Control 863). At a median follow‐up of 6.5 years, 396 deaths (23%) and 602 RFS events (35%) (relapse and/or death) have been observed.

Imagine there's a special medicine (treatment A) that some women with breast cancer were given after they finished their main cancer treatment (chemotherapy). This medicine was supposed to help them even more, but scientists wanted to make sure it really worked before everyone started using it.

They did a big study with lots of women who had early breast cancer. These women all had surgery and then got six rounds of a special cancer-fighting drug (chemotherapy). After that, half of the women got the extra medicine (treatment A) for three years, and the other half didn't get any more treatment.

The scientists watched these women for a long time to see who lived longer and who had their cancer come back. They wanted to know if the extra medicine made a big difference in how long the women lived or if their cancer came back.

After looking at all the data, they found that the extra medicine didn't make a big difference in how long the women lived overall. So, it didn't help them live longer compared to those who didn't take the extra medicine.

However, they did notice that the women who took the extra medicine were slightly less likely to have their cancer come back during the first 5 years after their main treatment. This means it might help a little bit with preventing the cancer from coming back sooner, but it doesn't change how long they live in the"

Methods:
This is a multicenter two‐arm randomized trial comparing colposcopy alone with colposcopy plus intervention A. Patients were recruited from 13 colposcopy clinics in a variety of practice settings. 2299 women referred for the evaluation of an abnormal cervical cytology were randomized with stratification by cytology; subsequently 113 women were excluded for a variety of reasons. The main study outcomes were differences in true‐positive rates (CIN 2, 3 and cancer identified) and false‐positive rates between the study arms.
Results:
The true‐positive (TP) rates were 14.4% vs. 11.4% (p=0.035, one‐sided) for the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm compared to colposcopy‐only arm, respectively, in women with either an atypical squamous cell (ASC) or low‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) cytology result. TP rates were similar between the two arms among women referred for the evaluation of HSIL (high‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). The 26.5% gain in true‐positives observed with the use of intervention A and colposcopy among women referred for an ASC or LSIL cytology was achieved with only a fractional increase in number of biopsies obtained per patient (0.30) and a modest increase in false‐positive rate

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of treatment A plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) therapy in comparison with CAF alone, in patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
In this randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial, patients were treated with six cycles of CAF therapy: 28 days/cycle, with doxorubicin (25 mg/m2) and fluorouracil (500 mg/m2) administered on days 1 and 8 and cyclophosphamide (100 mg orally [PO]) administered on day 1 through 14. Primary end point was overall response rate (ORR; partial or complete response). In total, 221 patients were assessable.
Results:
ORR was 42.6% for CAF compared with 53.1% for treatment A + CAF, a 24.6% relative improvement and 10.5% absolute increase (P = .077). There was a trend for prolonged progression‐free survival (PFS; median 241 days for CAF v 366 days for treatment A + CAF; P = .145). In retrospectively defined subgroups, significant improvement in PFS in favor of treatment A was observed in patients who were premenopausal, had no prior therapy, and were stage IV at diagnosis with an intact primary tumor. Except for neutropenia and leukopenia, there was no statistically significant excess of grade 3/4 adverse events compared with CAF.

**What the passage is about:**
The passage is about a study where doctors wanted to see if giving a special treatment (called treatment A) along with a common cancer medicine combination (CAF) was better than just using the CAF medicine alone for people with advanced or cancer that came back after initial treatment.

**What they did:**
They did a study where some patients got the CAF treatment alone, and others got the CAF treatment plus the new treatment A. This study was set up so that neither the patients nor the doctors knew who got which treatment to make sure the results were fair (this is called a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial).

**What they found:**
- The CAF treatment alone helped 42.6% of the patients, while the CAF plus treatment A helped 53.1% of the patients. This means that treatment A plus CAF was better and helped more people than just CAF alone.
- The time before the cancer got worse again (called progression-free survival) was longer for the patients who got CAF plus treatment A (366 days) compared to those who got just CAF (241 days).
- Even though treatment A plus CAF helped more people, there wasn't a big difference in side effects (adverse events) compared to just CAF. The only common side effects that were a bit more"

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of treatment A plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) therapy in comparison with CAF + placebo, in patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
In this randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial, patients were treated with six cycles of CAF therapy: 28 days/cycle, with doxorubicin (25 mg/m2) and fluorouracil (500 mg/m2) administered on days 1 and 8 and cyclophosphamide (100 mg orally [PO]) administered on day 1 through 14. Primary end point was overall response rate (ORR; partial or complete response). In total, 221 patients were assessable.
Results:
A total of 227 patients were recruited, the full analysis set consisted of 221 patients. ORR was 42.6% (95% confidence interval (CI), 33.1 to 52.5) for CAF + placebo compared with 53.1% (95% CI, 43.5 to 62.5) for treatment A + CAF (P = .077).

Imagine there's a new medicine called ""CAF"" that doctors use to treat women with a serious kind of cancer called breast cancer. This medicine is made up of three parts: doxorubicin, fluorouracil, and cyclophosphamide.

Scientists wanted to know if giving this CAF medicine along with another special treatment called ""treatment A"" would work better than just giving the CAF medicine alone. So, they did a big study where they randomly picked 227 women with advanced or came-back breast cancer and gave them either the CAF medicine with a fake treatment (placebo) or the CAF medicine with the real treatment A.

The study found that when women got the CAF medicine with the real treatment A, 53.1% of them saw their cancer get better (this is called an overall response rate). When they got the CAF medicine with the fake treatment, only 42.6% saw their cancer get better. The difference wasn't big enough to say that treatment A makes a huge difference, because the numbers are pretty close (the difference is like saying 42.6% is 10 percentage points less than 53.1%).

In 1996, we initiated the multicenter phase III randomized trial to compare the effect on disease‐free survival (DFS) of experimental treatment A versus comparator B after breast‐conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer. This report presents the clinical results with a median follow‐up of 60 months.
Patients and methods:
Between February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery.
Results:
There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5‐year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis‐free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76).

Overall response rate (ORR) was 32% in both arms, p=0.931. The median time to treatment failure (TTF; defined as discontinuation, progressive disease, death as a result of any cause, or the start of a new anticancer therapy) was 4.24 months (95% CI, 4.11 to 4.44) for treatment A and 4.07 months (95% CI, 3.81 to 4.24) for comparator B, p=0.059. The medial overall survival was 19.29 months (95% CI, 15.57 to 23.59) for treatment A vs. 21.45 months (95% CI, 17.12 to 24.94), p=0.983. Hematologic toxicity was similar in both arms, except for grades 3 to 4 leukopenia (treatment A, 78%; comparator B, 66%; P = .025) and transfusions (treatment A, 17%; comparator B, 7%; P = .0051) and grades 3 to 4 diarrhea (treatment A, 8%; comparator B, 18%; p=0.009), mucositis (treatment A, 4%; comparator B, 15%; p<.001), and hand‐and‐foot syndrome (treatment A, 0%; comparator B, 26%, p<.001). 13% in treatment A arm and 27% in the comparator B arm discontinued because of drug‐related adverse events (P = .002).

Treatment A was not more effective than comparator B for patients with advanced breast cancer.",no_spin,"Sure, let's break it down into simpler terms:

Imagine there's a new medicine (let's call it Treatment A) and a regular medicine (Comparator B) that doctors use to treat a serious illness called advanced breast cancer. Scientists wanted to see which one works better and is safer.

They did a big study with 305 patients. They divided the patients into two groups, giving half Treatment A and the other half Comparator B. The main thing they wanted to know was how long the patients could live without their cancer getting worse (this is called progression-free survival).

After looking at the results, they found that both treatments worked about the same. The median time (which means the middle number) that patients lived without their cancer getting worse was 8.05 months for Treatment A and 7.98 months for Comparator B. This difference wasn't big enough to say one was better than the other (the p-value was 0.121, which is not small enough to say they're really different).

Both treatments also helped about the same number of patients get better (32% in each group), and the side effects were similar, but with a few differences:

- Treatment A caused more severe leukopenia (low white blood cell count) and more transfusions (getting extra blood) than Comparator B.
- Comparator B caused more severe diarrhea and more hand-and-foot syndrome (a skin reaction) than Treatment A"
42,20087643,A bupropion smoking cessation clinical trial for cancer patients,Cancer Causes Control,"Objective:
Many cancer patients continue to smoke postdiagnosis, yet there have been few smoking cessation trials for this population.
Methods:
This double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial randomized 246 cancer patients to 9 weeks of placebo or treatment A, stratifying by pre‐treatment depression symptoms. In addition, all patients received transdermal nicotine and behavioral counseling. Primary outcomes were 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence, biochemically confirmed, at the end of treatment (Week 12), and at 6 months post quit day (Week 27). Additional outcomes included: withdrawal, affect, quality of life, compliance, and side effects.
Results:
There was no main effect of treatment A vs. placebo on abstinence (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.38‐4.81, p =0.64). At week 12, the abstinence rates were 24.2% for placebo and 27.2% for treatment A; at week 27, the abstinence rates were 17.4% for placebo and 18.4% for treatment A. There was no statistically significant difference between placebo and treatment A in average daily smoking to week 12 (mean [SE] 5.2 [0.95] vs. 5.3 [1.0]; p=0.97); and to week 27 (mean [SE] 5.4 [0.88] vs. 6.1 [0.90]; p=0.64). There were no statistically significant difference between placebo and treatment A on changes in withdrawals (p=0.39); negative (p=0.41) and positive affect (p=0.77), and physical (p=0.31) and mental (p=0.42) quality of life.
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than placebo on the prevalence of abstinence of cancer patients who continue to smoke postdiagnosis.",no_spin,"Sure, let's break it down into simpler terms:

Imagine there are people who have cancer and they also smoke cigarettes. Even though doctors know smoking is bad for people with cancer, not many studies have been done to help these people stop smoking.

In this study, scientists wanted to see if a special treatment (let's call it Treatment A) could help cancer patients stop smoking better than just giving them a fake treatment (placebo). The special treatment was given to 246 cancer patients for 9 weeks. Some patients got the real treatment, and others got a pretend treatment to see if they believed it was working.

The goal was to check if more people who got the real treatment would stop smoking for at least 7 days after the treatment ended (which was 12 weeks later) and also 6 months after that. They also looked at how the patients felt, if they had withdrawal symptoms (like craving a cigarette), how their mood was, and how their quality of life changed.

The results showed that the special treatment didn't help more people stop smoking compared to the fake treatment. At the end of the 9 weeks, 24.2% of the people who got the placebo (fake treatment) and 27.2% of those who got the real treatment stopped smoking for 7 days. Six months later, it was 17.4% for the placebo group and 18.4% for the real treatment group.

41,20087643,A bupropion smoking cessation clinical trial for cancer patients,Cancer Causes Control,"Objective:
Many cancer patients continue to smoke postdiagnosis, yet there have been few smoking cessation trials for this population. Depression, which is prevalent among cancer patients, may be a barrier to cessation.
Methods:
This double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial randomized 246 cancer patients to 9 weeks of placebo or treatment A, stratifying by pre‐treatment depression symptoms. In addition, all patients received transdermal nicotine and behavioral counseling. Primary outcomes were 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence, biochemically confirmed, at the end of treatment (Week 12), and at 6 months post quit day (Week 27). Additional outcomes included: withdrawal, affect, quality of life, compliance, and side effects.
Results:
There was no main effect of treatment A vs. placebo on abstinence (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.38‐4.81, p = 0.64). Patients with depression symptoms reported significantly lower abstinence rates vs. patients without depression symptoms (OR = .14, 95% CI: 0.02‐0.80, p=0.03). Treatment A increased abstinence rates, vs. placebo, more for participants with depression vs. those without depression symptoms. For patients with depression symptoms, treatment A reduced withdrawal symptoms and improved quality of life vs. placebo.
Conclusion:
For patients with depression symptoms, treatment increases abstinence rates, lowers withdrawal, and increases quality of life. However, abstinence rates among patients with depression symptoms were low vs. patients without depression symptoms, who exhibited similar abstinence rates when treated with treatment A or transdermal nicotine and counseling alone. These results can guide future smoking cessation intervention studies with cancer patients.",spin,"Sure, let's break it down into simpler terms:

**The Problem:**
Some people who have cancer keep smoking even after they find out they're sick. This is not good because smoking can make cancer worse. The researchers wanted to see if there was a way to help these people stop smoking.

**The Study:**
They did a special experiment with 246 people who had cancer. Half of them got a fake treatment (placebo) and the other half got a real treatment (treatment A). Everyone got some nicotine patches (to help with withdrawal) and counseling (support to quit smoking) whether they got the real treatment or not.

**The Results:**
The real treatment (treatment A) didn't make a big difference in helping people stop smoking compared to the placebo. However, people who were feeling sad or depressed (which is common for people with cancer) had a much harder time quitting.

**What They Found:**
For people who were sad or depressed, the real treatment (treatment A) helped a little. It made it easier for them to stop smoking by reducing their withdrawal symptoms and making their quality of life better. But, even with the help, people who were sad or depressed still had a harder time quitting than those who weren't sad or depressed.

**The Conclusion:**
The real treatment helped a bit for people who were sad or depressed, but it wasn't a magic cure. They still had"

We aimed to compare overall survival in patients receiving treatment A or comparator B.
Methods:
This was an open‐label randomized trial undertaken in 50 centres across eight countries. 1006 treatment‐naive patients diagnosed with advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma were randomly allocated (1 to 1) by minimization to receive comparator B or treatment A. Treatment was not masked. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Treatment groups were compared with a non‐stratified log‐ rank test. Analysis was by intention to treat.

Findings:
502 patients were randomly assigned to receive comparator B and 504 to receive combined treatment A. Median follow‐up was 37.2 months (24.8‐52.3).

Imagine there are two types of medicine, A and B, that doctors use to treat a serious kind of cancer called advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma. This study wanted to see which medicine worked better for patients.

They did a big study with 1006 patients from 50 different places around the world. The patients were divided randomly to try either medicine B or medicine A. The doctors knew which medicine each patient was getting (this is called an open-label study), and the patients also knew.

The main thing they wanted to check was how long the patients lived after getting the treatment, which is called overall survival. They compared the two groups using a special test and said that, based on their findings, the two medicines didn't make a big difference in how long the patients lived. The difference in survival between the two groups was only about 0.3% at one year and 2.7% at three years.

Even though medicine A didn't make the patients live longer on average compared to medicine B, some patients who got medicine A had a good response and lived longer because their cancer got better or went into remission (which means the cancer symptoms went away).

The study says it's important to find out which patients will benefit the most from medicine A because it might help them live longer even though it doesn't work for everyone.

Cancer‐related fatigue is a debilitating symptom affecting psychosocial functioning and quality of life in 70% to 100% of cancer patients during and after treatment. The authors examined the effect of 200 mg of treatment A compared to placebo on the severity of cancer‐related fatigue.
Methods:
The authors conducted a multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐ controlled, phase 3, clinical trial to examine the effect of treatment A on patient‐ reported fatigue in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. A sample of 877 cancer patients beginning chemotherapy at 23 geographically separate University of Rochester Cancer Center (URCC) Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) affiliates were assessed for fatigue. Patients who reported fatigue (N = 867) were randomly assigned to receive either treatment A or a placebo. Treatment began on Day 5 of Cycle 2 and ended after Day 7 of Cycle 4. Fatigue, sleepiness and depression were assessed during Cycles 2 to 4 by using psychometrically valid measures.

ANCOVA showed a significant interaction between treatment condition and baseline fatigue (P = .017), where patients with severe baseline fatigue (n = 458) benefited from treatment A, whereas patients with mild or moderate fatigue did not. Treatment A had no statistically significant effect on depression (P > .05).

Treatment A may be useful in controlling cancer‐related fatigue in patients who present with severe fatigue but is not useful in patients with mild or moderate fatigue.",spin,"Sure, let's break it down into simpler terms:

Imagine a group of kids who are feeling really tired all the time because they're going through cancer treatment. This tiredness is called ""cancer-related fatigue."" It makes it hard for them to do their normal activities and enjoy life.

Scientists wanted to see if a special treatment (let's call it ""Treatment A"") could help these kids feel less tired. They did a big study with lots of kids who were starting chemotherapy (a type of cancer treatment) at different places connected to a big cancer center.

In this study, 867 kids were checked to see if they felt tired. Then, they were randomly picked to either get Treatment A or a pretend treatment (a placebo) to see which one worked better. Treatment A was given for a few days during their second and fourth cycles of chemotherapy.

The scientists measured how tired the kids felt by using special tests. They compared how tired the kids were before and after getting Treatment A or the placebo, making sure to account for how tired they were at the start.

The results showed that Treatment A helped kids who were very tired (severely fatigued) at the beginning. These kids felt less tired after getting Treatment A. However, it didn't help the kids who were just a little or moderately tired.

In simple terms, Treatment A is like a special medicine that helps some kids feel less tired if they're"

Imagine there's a new medicine called ""Treatment A"" that doctors want to use along with the usual treatment for a type of cancer called acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This type of cancer affects the blood and bone marrow.

The doctors wanted to see if adding ""Treatment A"" would make the treatment work better and be safer. They did a big study with 260 patients who had AML. Half of the patients got the usual treatment plus ""Treatment A,"" and the other half just got the usual treatment without ""Treatment A.""

They looked to see if more people in the first group (with ""Treatment A"") got better (had a complete response to the treatment) and if they lived longer (had a better overall survival rate) compared to the second group.

The results showed that:

This test is like a big experiment that's happening in different places at the same time (that's what ""multicenter phase III"" means).

In this experiment, they compared two groups of people with AML. One group got the new medicine (Treatment A) along with their usual treatment, and the other group just got their usual treatment. They wanted to see if Treatment A made a difference.

The results showed that Treatment A helped. It made the sickness (leukopenia) less severe and didn't last as long. Also, when they looked at how long the people lived (this is called Overall Survival, or OS), they found that, on average, people in both groups lived about the same length of time. But, for people with a certain type of AML that has myeloblastic features, the new medicine seemed to make a bigger difference.

A two‐arm, double‐blind, randomized trial was performed to evaluate the effect of treatment A on acute skin‐related toxicity in patients undergoing breast or chest wall radiotherapy.
Methods and material:
Patients with ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast carcinoma who were undergoing external beam radiotherapy to the breast or chest wall were randomly assigned to apply treatment A or placebo cream daily. The primary study endpoint was the provider assessed maximal grade of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, radiation dermatitis.
Results:
A total of 176 patients were enrolled between September 21, 2007, and December 7, 2007. The provider assessed primary endpoint showed no difference in the mean maximum grade of radiation dermatitis by treatment arm (1.2+/‐0.85 for treatment A vs. 1.3+/‐0.80 for placebo; p = .18). Severe radiation dermatitis concerned 4 (5%) in both arms; p=.97. The worst grade of any type of toxicity were respectively in the placebo and treatment A groups 9% vs. 2% for grade 3 or 4: 24% vs. 30% for grade 2; 61% vs. 40% for grade 1; and 6% vs. 27% for grade 0; p = .04.

**Purpose:**
The researchers wanted to see if using a special cream (Treatment A) during radiotherapy for breast or chest wall cancer could help prevent skin problems caused by the radiation.

**How they did it:**
They took 176 patients who had breast or chest wall cancer and randomly divided them into two groups. One group used the special cream every day, and the other group used a cream that didn't do anything (placebo). They watched to see if the cream made a difference in how bad the skin problems got during the radiotherapy.

**What they found:**
- The skin problems (radiation dermatitis) were about the same in both groups. The cream didn't make a big difference in preventing or worsening the skin issues.
- There were a few cases (4 out of 176) where the skin problems were very bad in both groups, and it didn't matter if they used the cream or not.
- When they looked at how severe the skin problems were, the cream didn't help much. The number of patients with mild, moderate, or severe skin issues was about the same in both groups.

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment A in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer (OC).
Methods:
Patients with platinum‐refractory or ‐resistant primary or secondary) OC were randomized to receive treatment A and PLD at 50 mg/m2 intravenously or PLD alone at 50 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 every 28 days until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression‐free survival (PFS). Other end points were objective response rate and safety. The study was originally planned for 244 patients. The trial was temporarily placed on hold after 125 patients were randomized while the results of another trial were being reviewed and the sponsor decided not to resume enrollment. The interim analysis became the final analysis.
Results:
The median PFS was 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD (n = 65) versus 3.7 months for PLD (n = 60) (hazards ratio, 0.92; P = 0.7243). A preplanned subgroup analysis showed that 75 patients with platinum‐refractory or primary platinum‐resistant OC had a median PFS of 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD versus 2.9 months for PLD (hazards ratio, 0.55; P = 0.0425). Hematologic adverse events were 66% on the treatment A + PLD arm versus 44% on the PLD arm, manageable with dose reductions. Nonhematologic adverse events were similar for both arms. The incidence of palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis was lower on treatment A + PLD (23%, 31%, respectively) versus (39%, 49%, respectively) on PLD.
Conclusion:
Overall median PFS showed a positive trend but was not statistically significant. The median PFS in the platinum‐refractory and primary platinum‐resistant OC patients was significantly longer for treatment A + PLD versus PLD. Treatment A may ameliorate the palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis known to be associated with PLD.

**What They Found:**
- When they compared how long the cancer took to get worse (called progression-free survival), they saw that using both medicines together (treatment A + PLD) helped a bit more than just using PLD alone, but it wasn't a huge difference.
- For people who had cancer that was really tough to start with (platinum-refractory or primary platinum-resistant), using both medicines together made a bigger difference. Their cancer took longer to get worse compared to just using PLD.
- Side effects were manageable. More people who used both medicines together had skin issues (like redness on palms and soles), but"

Patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagogastric junction (AEG II and III) were randomly assigned to treatment A followed by surgery or to surgery alone. To detect with 80% power an improvement in median survival from 17 months with surgery alone to 24 months with treatment A, 282 events were required.
Results:
This trial was stopped for poor accrual after 144 patients were randomly assigned (72:72); 52.8% patients had tumors located in the proximal third of the stomach, including AEG type II and III. The International Union against Cancer R0 resection rate was 81.9% after treatment A as compared with 66.7% with surgery alone (P = .036). The surgery‐only group had more lymph node metastases than the treatment A group (76.5% v 61.4%; P = .018).

Conclusion:
This trial showed a significantly increased R0 resection rate but failed to demonstrate a survival benefit. Possible explanations are low statistical power, a high rate of proximal gastric cancer including AEG and/or a better outcome than expected after radical surgery alone due to the high quality of surgery with resections of regional lymph nodes outside the perigastic area (celiac trunc, hepatic ligament, lymph node at a. lienalis; D2).",spin,"Sure, let's break it down into simpler terms:

They randomly chose some patients to get treatment A first, followed by surgery, and other patients just to have surgery. They did this to see if treatment A could help people live longer by improving their chances of surviving after surgery.

**What they found:**
- **More successful surgeries:** Treatment A helped more patients have successful surgeries where all the cancer was removed (called R0 resection), especially in the top part of the stomach.
- **Fewer lymph node metastases:** Patients who got treatment A had fewer cancer cells in their lymph nodes.
- **More complications after treatment A:** Patients who got treatment A had more problems after surgery.
- **No survival benefit:** Even though treatment A helped with surgeries, it didn't help people live longer. After following the patients for a long time, the difference in how long they lived wasn't big enough to say treatment A was definitely better.

**Why it might not have worked:**
- **Not enough patients:** They didn't get enough patients to participate in the study, which made it hard to"

Conclusion:
Treatment A followed by surgery was not more effective than surgery alone on overall survival in patients with locally advanced cancer of the stomach.",no_spin,"Sure, let's break it down into simpler terms:

**What the passage is about:**
The passage talks about a study where doctors tested a special treatment (called treatment A) on people with a type of stomach cancer that had spread to nearby areas. This cancer is called locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagogastric junction (AEGII and III).

**What they did:**
The study divided patients into two groups:
1. Group 1 got treatment A first, and then surgery.
2. Group 2 got surgery alone (no treatment A before surgery).

**What they measured:**
The main thing they wanted to know was how long the patients lived after getting the treatment (this is called overall survival).

**What they found:**
- After 4.4 years, they looked at how many people had died in each group. They found that treatment A plus surgery didn't make people live longer than just having surgery (the difference in survival times was not significant).
- At 2 years, about 72.7% of people in the treatment A group and 69.9% in the surgery-only group were still alive.
- Treatment A didn't stop the cancer from growing (progression-free survival) any better than surgery alone.
- When they looked at how well the surgery removed all the cancer (R0 resection), treatment A helped more"

**The Problem:**
Some people who have had cancer have trouble sleeping after their treatment ends. This problem is common, with about 23% to 61% of cancer survivors experiencing it.

**The Medication:**

**The Study:**
Scientists wanted to see if a new treatment (let's call it Treatment A) could help cancer patients sleep better while they're getting cancer treatment. They gave either Treatment A or a fake pill (placebo) to people for 8 weeks and checked how well they slept using a special sleep quality test.

**The Results:**
The main result showed that Treatment A didn't make a big difference in how well people slept, as measured by the sleep quality test. The scores for both Treatment A and the placebo were very close, and the difference wasn't big enough to say Treatment A worked better.

High levels of distress and need for self‐care information by patients commencing chemotherapy suggest that current prechemotherapy education is suboptimal. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of a prechemotherapy education intervention (treatment A) to assess impact on patient distress, treatment‐related concerns, and the prevalence and severity of and bother caused by six chemotherapy side‐effects.
Patients and methods:
One hundred and ninety‐two breast, gastrointestinal, and haematologic cancer patients were recruited before the trial closing prematurely (original target 352). Treatment A was administered before first treatment (intervention 1), 48 h after first treatment (intervention 2), and immediately before second treatment (intervention 3). Patient outcomes were measured at baseline (T1: pre‐education) and immediately preceding treatment cycles 1 (T2) and 3 (T3).
Results:
Treatment A did not significantly reduce patient distress. However, a significant decrease in sensory/psychological (P=0.027) and procedural (P=0.03) concerns, as well as prevalence and severity of and bother due to vomiting (all P=0.001), were observed at T3. In addition, subgroup analysis of patients with elevated distress at T1 indicated a significant decrease (P=0.035) at T2 but not at T3 (P=0.055) in treatment A patients.

Imagine you're going to start a new medicine (chemotherapy) to help with a serious health issue. Before you start, you might feel really worried or scared about what will happen. This passage is about a study that wanted to see if teaching people more about this medicine before they start could help them feel less worried.

The study did something called a ""randomized, controlled trial."" This means they picked some people who were going to start chemotherapy and divided them into two groups. One group got extra information about what to expect and how to take care of themselves before they started their medicine. The other group didn't get this extra information.

The researchers checked how worried the people were before they got the information (at the start), right after they got their first dose of medicine, and then again after their second dose.

Here's what they found:

1. **Worry (Distress)**: Giving extra information didn't make a big difference in how worried people were overall.

2. **Worries About Side Effects**: When it came to being worried about the side effects of the medicine, like feeling sick or having other problems, the group that got extra information felt better. They were less worried about things like throwing up and other side effects, and they also noticed these side effects less often and found them less bothersome.
