Randomized trial of fenretinide to prevent second breast malignancy in women with early breast cancer",J Natl Cancer Inst,"Background:
Treatment A has been shown to inhibit breast carcinogenesis in preclinical studies. We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.
Methods:
We randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30‐70 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66‐1.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64‐1.09; P = .177) between the two arms. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs (38 in the treatment A arm versus 40 in the control arm), incidence of distant metastasis (HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.79‐1.22; P = .858), and all‐cause mortality (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.92‐1.48; P = .215).
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than no treatment in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.",no_spin,"Sure, let's break it down into simpler terms:

Imagine there's a special medicine called Treatment A that scientists think might stop breast cancer from coming back in the other breast. They wanted to see if this medicine really works, so they did a big study with lots of women who had breast cancer.

In this study, they took 2972 women, all around 30 to 70 years old, who had either early breast cancer or a type of breast cancer that hadn't spread yet. Half of these women took the medicine every day for 5 years, and the other half didn't take anything.

The scientists watched these women for 7 whole years to see if breast cancer came back in the same breast or the other breast. They also checked for cancer in other parts of the body and if the cancer spread to distant places, and they looked at how many of the women passed away during the study.

After looking at all the data, the scientists found that there was no big difference between the group that took the medicine and the group that didn't. Both groups had about the same number of women get breast cancer in the other breast or the same breast. Also, there were no big differences in cancer in other parts of the body, cancer spreading to distant places, or the number of women who died.

So, based on this study, the medicine didn't seem to help prevent breast cancer from coming back in women who already had breast"

The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. Other end points considered post hoc were the same outcomes stratified by menopausal status, incidence of distant metastases, overall mortality, and tumors in other organs. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (P =.642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (P =.177) between the two arms. However, an interaction was detected between treatment A and menopausal status in both outcomes (P for interaction in both outcomes =.045), with a possible beneficial effect in premenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66, and 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.41‐1.07; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 0.65, and 95% CI = 0.46‐0. 92) and an opposite effect in postmenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.32, and 95% CI = 0.82‐2.15; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.19, and 95% CI = 0.75‐1. 89). There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs, incidence of distant metastasis, and all‐cause mortality.
Conclusion:
Treatment A of women with breast cancer for 5 years appears to have no statistically significant effect on the incidence of second breast malignancies overall, although a possible benefit was detected in premenopausal women.

They wanted to see if this medicine really works, so they did a big study with lots of women who had early breast cancer or a type of breast cancer that hadn't spread much.

In this study, half the women took the medicine every day for 5 years, and the other half didn't take anything. The scientists checked to see if breast cancer came back on the opposite side (contralateral breast cancer) or on the same side (ipsilateral breast cancer) after 7 years.

After looking at the results, the scientists found that, overall, the medicine didn't make a big difference in stopping breast cancer from coming back. It didn't work as well as they hoped for all the women in the study.

But here's where it gets a bit tricky: When they looked closer at the women based on whether they were still having periods (premenopausal) or had stopped having periods (postmenopausal), they noticed something interesting. For women who were still having periods, the medicine seemed to help a little bit - their chance of getting breast cancer on the opposite side was lower (about 66% less likely). However, for women who had stopped having periods, the medicine didn't help and actually made it a bit more likely (32"

It is uncertain whether treatment A provides additional benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. This trial was initiated to explore this question.
Patients and methods:
Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization. The two end points of interest for this study were time to treatment failure (TTF) and survival time.
Results:
Median survival was 30.0 months for chemotherapy alone and 29.3 months treatment A and chemotherapy, p=0.834. Time to treatment failure (TTF) was 13.4 months for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with 10.3 month for chemotherapy alone patients (P = .087). The response rates (complete response and partial response) was 69.2% of for patients who received chemotherapy alone and 68.9% for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy, P =.99. There was no significant difference in toxicities seen between the two arms of the study. There were four lethal toxicities. Three infectious deaths occurred in patients receiving treatment A with chemotherapy.

Imagine there was a question about whether using a special treatment (let's call it Treatment A) along with regular cancer medicine (chemotherapy) is better than just using chemotherapy alone for people with a type of cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic breast cancer).

This study wanted to find out the answer by giving chemotherapy alone to some people and both chemotherapy and Treatment A to others. They did this for a few years, from January 1988 to December 1992, and looked at how long the people lived (survival time) and how long it took for the cancer to come back (time to treatment failure).

Here's what they found:

- Both groups of people lived about the same amount of time, around 30 months (which is about 2.5 years). The difference in how long they lived wasn't big enough to say one treatment was definitely better than the other (p=0.834).

- The time it took for the cancer to come back was a bit longer for the group that got both treatments (Treatment A + chemotherapy), at 13.4 months, compared to 10.3 months for the group that just got chemotherapy. This difference was small and not very strong (P = .087), meaning it's not super clear if Treatment A plus chemotherapy is better.

Patients and methods:
Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with estrogen receptor (ER)‐positive or ER‐unknown metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization.
Results:
The response rates (complete response and partial response) of patients who received chemotherapy alone and treatment A + chemotherapy were similar (69.2% v 68.9%, respectively; P =.99). Time to treatment failure (TTF) was slightly longer for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone patients (13.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.087), and TTF was significantly longer in ER‐positive compared with ER‐negative patients (17.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.048). However, ER status had no effect on overall survival (30.0 months for chemotherapy alone v 29.3 months for treatment A + chemotherapy).

Imagine there's a new medicine called ""Treatment A"" that some doctors want to use along with regular cancer treatment (chemotherapy) to see if it helps more. This study wanted to find out if using Treatment A with chemotherapy is better than just using chemotherapy alone for women with a certain type of breast cancer that might respond to hormones.

They did this study from January 1988 to December 1992. They picked 231 women with a type of breast cancer that might respond to hormones (called estrogen receptor-positive or ER-unknown). The women were divided into two groups: one group got just chemotherapy, and the other group got chemotherapy plus Treatment A.

The results showed that both groups had about the same number of women who got better (response rates) - around 69% in each group. The time it took for the cancer to come back (called Time to Treatment Failure or TTF) was a bit longer for the group that got both treatments (about 13.4 months) compared to the group that got just chemotherapy (about 10.3 months). This difference was small and not very sure (P = 0.087), which means it could have been due to chance.

When they looked at the type of breast cancer that might respond to hormones (ER-positive), the group that got both treatments had a slightly longer TTF (about 17.4 months"

Efficacy and safety of treatment A was compared with comparator B in a group of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, without previous systemic therapy for advanced breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
The study was a prospective double‐blind randomized trial. All treated patients presented with positive estrogen receptors. Main end points were response rates, toxicity profile analysis, time to progression and survival. WHO and ECOG criteria were employed for response evaluation while toxicity was assessed according to WHO guidelines. Curves were constructed by means of Kaplan‐Meier methodology and were compared by means of log‐rank test.
Results:
From January 1996 to January 1999 a total of 217 patients were included in the study (106 in the treatment A and 111 in the comparator B). Both groups of patients were homogeneous regarding the main prognostic factors. A response rate of 64% (68/106) was observed in the treatment A group as compared with a 52% (58/111) in the comparator B group. Median times to progression and overall survival were not significantly different. A lower incidence of undesirable effects was appreciated in the treatment A arm.

Imagine there was a study where doctors were testing two different treatments for women with a serious type of breast cancer that comes back after menopause. This cancer is called ""advanced breast cancer."" The treatments are called ""Treatment A"" and ""Comparator B.""

The study wanted to see which treatment worked better and had fewer side effects. It was done in a special way where neither the patients nor the doctors knew who got Treatment A or B until the end of the study, to make sure the results were fair.

They found that Treatment A worked better than Comparator B in making the cancer shrink. Specifically, 64% of the women who got Treatment A had their cancer shrink, compared to 52% of the women who got Comparator B. This means Treatment A was more effective.

Both treatments had similar results for how long the women lived, which is a good thing. Also, Treatment A had fewer bad side effects than Comparator B.

The conclusion of the study is that Treatment A is a good and safe choice for women with this type of breast cancer. It works well and doesn't make them feel too sick. The study suggests that doctors should consider using Treatment A as the first treatment or even as an extra treatment after the main one for women with this kind of breast cancer.

They wanted to see if one treatment worked better than the other. The study was done in a special way where neither the patients nor the doctors knew who got which treatment to make sure the results were fair.

They checked a few important things:

1. **Response Rates**: This means they looked to see how many women got better (their cancer went away or became smaller) with each treatment. In Treatment A, 64% of the women got better, and in Comparator B, 52% did.

2. **Toxicity Profile Analysis**: They checked how many side effects the women had with each treatment. Treatment A had fewer side effects.

3. **Time to Progression and Survival**: They also looked at how long it took for the cancer to get worse (time to progression) and how long the women lived (overall survival). There wasn't a big difference between the two treatments in these areas.

**Conclusion**: The study found that Treatment A was not better than Comparator B in helping women with advanced breast cancer. Both treatments had similar effects on the cancer, and Treatment A had fewer side effects but didn't make a big difference in how long the women lived.

The results showed that Treatment A didn't make the cancer get worse any slower than Comparator B. In fact, the cancer got worse faster with Treatment A (5.4 months) compared to Comparator B (3.4 months). Also, there wasn't a big difference in how long the cancer stayed in remission (Time to Treatment Failure, or TTF) between the two treatments.

Even though more women died on Treatment A (35.4%) than on Comparator B (33.5%), the difference wasn't big enough to say that one treatment is safer than the other. Both treatments had the same number of women (17.5%) whose cancer got better for a while (Objective Response Rate).

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy with or without treatment A primarily on disease‐free survival (DFS) and secondarily on overall survival (OS) in patients with high‐risk operable breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
From June 1997 until November 2000, 604 patients with T1‐3N1M0 or T3N0M0 tumors were randomized to three cycles of epirubicin 110 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of treatment A followed by three cycles of 'intensified' CMF (cyclophosphamide 840 mg/m2, methotrexate 47 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 840 mg/m2) (group A), or to four cycles of epirubicin followed by four cycles of CMF, as in group A (group B). All cycles were given every 2 weeks with granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor support.

DFS and OS did not differ significantly between treatment groups (log‐rank P = 0.55 and P = 0.38, respectively). The 3‐year DFS was 80% in group A and 77% in group B. Survival rates were 93% and 90%, respectively. Comparison of quality of life outcomes between the two groups showed no statistically significant differences. Both regimens were well tolerated and severe acute side‐effects were infrequent. No cases of severe cardiotoxicity or acute leukemia were recorded.
Conclusion:
Treatment A with a dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy was not more effective than a dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy alone in patients with high‐risk operable breast cancer.",no_spin,"Sure, let's break it down into simpler terms:

Imagine there was a big experiment to see if giving a special kind of medicine (called chemotherapy) in a certain way could help people with a serious kind of breast cancer (called high-risk operable breast cancer) live longer. This special way of giving the medicine is called ""dose-dense sequential chemotherapy.""

In this experiment, they had two groups of people with breast cancer. Group A got three rounds of one type of medicine (called epirubicin) followed by three rounds of another type of medicine (called Treatment A) and then three more rounds of a mix of three other medicines (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil). Group B got the same three rounds of epirubicin but then got four rounds of the same mix of three medicines as Group A.

The experiment was set up so that both groups got their treatments every two weeks and had some extra help to keep their white blood cells strong (called granulocyte colony-stimulating factor).

After a long time following the people in the experiment (61.7 months for Group A and 62 months for Group B), they looked to see if the way the medicine was given made a big difference in how long the people lived (this is called disease-free survival or DFS) and how long they lived in total (overall survival or OS).

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy with or without treatment A primarily on disease‐free survival (DFS) and secondarily on overall survival (OS) in patients with high‐risk operable breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
From June 1997 until November 2000, 604 patients with T1‐3N1M0 or T3N0M0 tumors were randomized to three cycles of epirubicin 110 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of treatment A followed by three cycles of 'intensified' CMF (cyclophosphamide 840 mg/m2, methotrexate 47 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 840 mg/m2) (group A), or to four cycles of epirubicin followed by four cycles of CMF, as in group A (group B). All cycles were given every 2 weeks with granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor support.
Results:
A total of 595 patients were eligible. Median follow‐up was 61.7 months for group A and 62 months for group B. The 3‐year DFS was 80% in group A and 77% in group B. Survival rates were 93% and 90%, respectively. The effect of treatment on the hazard of death was different according to hormonal receptor status. More specifically, in patients with negative receptor status the hazard of death was significantly higher for group B (hazard ratio 2.42). Both regimens were well tolerated and severe acute side‐effects were infrequent. No cases of severe cardiotoxicity or acute leukemia were recorded.
Conclusion:
The present study failed to demonstrate a significant difference in DFS or OS between the two treatment groups. However, our study has shown clearly that treatment A can be safely incorporated to dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy.",spin,"Sure, let's break it down into simpler terms:

The study looked at how two different treatment plans work for women with a type of breast cancer that's harder to treat (high-risk). The first plan is called ""dose-dense sequential chemotherapy"" with a medicine called ""epirubicin"" and then another treatment called ""A,"" followed by a strong combination of three other medicines (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil). The second plan is just a bit different, giving one more cycle of the same medicines as the first plan.

They did this study from June 1997 to November 2000 and followed the patients for a long time to see how well the treatments worked. They wanted to know if one plan helped the women live longer (survival) and if it helped keep the cancer from coming back (disease-free survival).

Here's what they found:

- Both treatment plans helped most of the women live for at least 3 years (survival rates were 93% for the first plan and 90% for the second plan).
- The first plan helped 80% of the women stay cancer-free for at least 3 years, while the second plan helped 77%.
- When they looked closer at the women's cancer based on a certain marker (hormonal receptor status), they saw that the second plan (with one extra"

To determine whether treatment A, improves survival in patients with brain metastases when used as an adjunct to whole‐brain radiation therapy (WBRT).
Patients and methods:
Patients with brain metastases from solid tumors and a Karnofsky performance score of > or = 70 were randomly assigned to receive WBRT with supplemental oxygen and either treatment A (treatment A arm) or no treatment (control arm). The primary end point was survival.
Results:
The study consisted of 515 eligible patients (treatment A arm, n = 265; control arm, n = 250). The median survival time (MST) was 5.4 months for the treatment A arm versus 4.4 months for the control arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87; P = .16). For the subgroup of patients with non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or breast cancer, the MST was 6.0 and 4.4 months, respectively (HR = 0.82; P = .07). Cox multiple regression analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of death for the treatment A arm in both primary populations. Further analysis indicated that the benefit may be restricted to the subgroup of patients with breast cancer. Response rates (radiographic complete response plus partial response) improved by 7% (P = .10) and 13% (P = .01) for all patients and for NSCLC and breast cancer patients in the treatment A arm, respectively. The most common severe adverse event in patients treated with treatment A was hypoxemia, which was reversible and effectively managed with supplemental oxygen in most patients.

- The study showed that Treatment A might be especially helpful for patients with breast cancer.
- Treatment A also helped more patients get better, as seen by a 7% increase in those who completely or partly got rid of their tumors"

They took 515 patients with brain tumors from solid cancers and checked if adding Treatment A made a big difference.

Here's what they found:

- **Survival Time:** When they looked at how long the patients lived, there wasn't a huge difference between the two groups. The group that got Treatment A lived about 1 month longer on average (5.4 months) compared to the group that didn't get Treatment A (4.4 months). But this difference wasn't big enough to say for sure that Treatment A is what caused it. The study didn't prove that Treatment A makes people live longer because the difference wasn't strong enough (the ""statistical significance"" wasn't there).

To compare treatment A and comparator B in node‐positive, operable breast cancer patients.
Methods and materials:
This was a randomized, multicenter, phase III trial enrolling 638 eligible women with prior breast surgery and positive axillary dissection. Patients in Arm A received treatment A, with concomitant radiotherapy (50 Gy +/‐ 10‐20‐Gy boost). Patients in Arm B received comparator B, with subsequent radiotherapy.
Results:
Median treatment durations were 64 and 126 days (Arms A and B, respectively), with no significant difference in overall or disease‐free survival. Five‐year locoregional relapse‐free survival favored patients with conservative surgery (two thirds of the population), with less local and / or regional recurrence in Arm A than in Arm B (3% vs. 9%; p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis in this subgroup showed a 2.8‐fold increased risk of locoregional recurrence with comparator B, independent of other prognostic factors (p = 0.027).

To assess whether the use of intervention A as an adjunct to colposcopy increases the detection of biopsy confirmed CIN 2, 3 (high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia).
Methods:
This is a multicenter two‐arm randomized trial comparing colposcopy alone with colposcopy plus intervention A. Patients were recruited from 13 colposcopy clinics in a variety of practice settings. 2299 women referred for the evaluation of an abnormal cervical cytology were randomized with stratification by cytology; subsequently 113 women were excluded for a variety of reasons. The main study outcomes were differences in true‐positive rates (CIN 2, 3 and cancer identified) and false‐positive rates between the study arms.
Results:
The true‐positive (TP) rates were 14.4% vs. 11.4% (p=0.035, one‐sided) for the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm compared to colposcopy‐only arm, respectively, in women with either an atypical squamous cell (ASC) or low‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) cytology result. TP rates were similar between the two arms among women referred for the evaluation of HSIL (high‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). The 26.5% gain in true‐positives observed with the use of intervention A and colposcopy among women referred for an ASC or LSIL cytology was achieved with only a fractional increase in number of biopsies obtained per patient (0.30) and a modest increase in false‐positive rate

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of treatment A plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) therapy in comparison with CAF alone, in patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
In this randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial, patients were treated with six cycles of CAF therapy: 28 days/cycle, with doxorubicin (25 mg/m2) and fluorouracil (500 mg/m2) administered on days 1 and 8 and cyclophosphamide (100 mg orally [PO]) administered on day 1 through 14. Primary end point was overall response rate (ORR; partial or complete response). In total, 221 patients were assessable.
Results:
ORR was 42.6% for CAF compared with 53.1% for treatment A + CAF, a 24.6% relative improvement and 10.5% absolute increase (P = .077). There was a trend for prolonged progression‐free survival (PFS; median 241 days for CAF v 366 days for treatment A + CAF; P = .145). In retrospectively defined subgroups, significant improvement in PFS in favor of treatment A was observed in patients who were premenopausal, had no prior therapy, and were stage IV at diagnosis with an intact primary tumor. Except for neutropenia and leukopenia, there was no statistically significant excess of grade 3/4 adverse events compared with CAF.

Conclusion:
Treatment A + CAF was well tolerated and is suggested to have efficacy in patients who had not received prior therapy.",spin,"Sure, let's break it down into simpler terms:

Imagine there was a study where doctors wanted to see if giving a special medicine (called treatment A) along with a common cancer treatment (CAF, which stands for cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil) is better than just using CAF alone for people with advanced or cancer that has come back.

In this study, they picked 221 people who had this kind of cancer and randomly chose who would get CAF alone or CAF plus the special medicine. The goal was to see how many people got better (this is called the overall response rate, or ORR).

The results showed that 42.6% of the people who got CAF alone got better, while 53.1% of those who got CAF plus the special medicine got better. That's a 24.6% higher chance of getting better with the special medicine. Also, the people who got CAF plus the special medicine lived longer without their cancer getting worse (this is called progression-free survival, or PFS).

However, the study didn't find a big difference in side effects between the two groups, except for some types of low white blood cell counts.

The conclusion was that the special medicine plus CAF seemed to work well and was safe for people who hadn't had cancer treatment before. But, they were careful to say that this study didn"

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of treatment A plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) therapy in comparison with CAF + placebo, in patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
In this randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial, patients were treated with six cycles of CAF therapy: 28 days/cycle, with doxorubicin (25 mg/m2) and fluorouracil (500 mg/m2) administered on days 1 and 8 and cyclophosphamide (100 mg orally [PO]) administered on day 1 through 14. Primary end point was overall response rate (ORR; partial or complete response). In total, 221 patients were assessable.
Results:
A total of 227 patients were recruited, the full analysis set consisted of 221 patients. ORR was 42.6% (95% confidence interval (CI), 33.1 to 52.5) for CAF + placebo compared with 53.1% (95% CI, 43.5 to 62.5) for treatment A + CAF (P = .077). The median progression‐free survival (PFS) was 241 days for CAF + placebo v 366 days for treatment A + CAF; P = .145. Any adverse event occurred more frequently with CAF + treatment A, 95.5% vs. 88.4%, p=0.025. Neutropenia occurred for 91.2% with CAF + treatment A vs 77.7% with CAF + placebo, p=0.005.

The study was looking at whether a special treatment called ""CAF therapy"" plus a medicine called cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (which together are often just called ""CAF"") worked better than just the CAF therapy plus a fake medicine (placebo). This was done to see if the real medicine plus the other drugs could help more with advanced or come-back breast cancer.

They did this study in a way where half the patients got the CAF therapy with the real medicine and the other half got the CAF therapy with the placebo. They gave the treatments over six cycles, which means six rounds of the therapy, every 28 days.

Here's what they found:

- The number of patients who got better (their cancer went away or became much smaller) was about 42.6% with just the CAF therapy and placebo, and about 53.1% with the CAF therapy plus the real medicine. The difference wasn't big enough to say for sure that the real medicine made a big difference (the numbers are close and the difference is not very certain because of the confidence interval).

- The time it took for the cancer to get worse again (called progression-free survival) was longer with just the CAF therapy and placebo (241 days) compared to the CAF therapy plus the real medicine (366 days)."

In 1996, we initiated the multicenter phase III randomized trial to compare the effect on disease‐free survival (DFS) of experimental treatment A versus comparator B after breast‐conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer. This report presents the clinical results with a median follow‐up of 60 months.
Patients and methods:
Between February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery.
Results:
There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5‐year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis‐free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76). Nevertheless, in the node‐positive subgroup, the 5‐year LRFS was statistically better in the treatment A arm (97% in treatment A v 91% in comparator B; P = .02), corresponding to a risk of locoregional recurrence decreased by 39% (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.93).
Conclusion:
This treatment protocol remains an appealing clinical option for many women with operable breast cancer at a high risk of recurrence. Combination treatments with new drugs for breast cancer are warranted.",spin,"Sure, let's break it down into simpler terms:

Imagine there was a big study where doctors wanted to see if a new way of treating breast cancer (let's call it Treatment A) worked better than a regular treatment (Treatment B) after surgery. This study took place from 1996 to 2000 and included 716 people with breast cancer.

The study found that, overall, both treatments worked about the same when it came to how long the people lived without their cancer coming back (this is called disease-free survival) or how long they lived in general. There wasn't a big difference in how well either treatment stopped the cancer from spreading to other parts of the body (locoregional recurrence-free survival) or in how long it took for the cancer to spread (metastasis-free survival).

But here's the twist: When they looked at a group of people with a specific type of breast cancer (where the cancer had spread to the nearby lymph nodes), Treatment A worked a little better. In this group, Treatment A helped prevent the cancer from coming back in the nearby area 39% more effectively than Treatment B. This means Treatment A was like a stronger shield against the cancer spreading to nearby places for these people.

The conclusion of the study says that even though the main results didn't show a big difference between the treatments, Treatment A is still a good option for many women with breast cancer who are at high"

Imagine there was a big study where doctors wanted to see if a new treatment (let's call it Treatment A) worked better than a regular treatment (Comparator B) for women with early breast cancer. The women who took part in the study had surgery to remove the cancer and then got either Treatment A or Comparator B to help prevent the cancer from coming back.

The study looked at how long it took for the cancer to come back (this is called disease-free survival) or if it spread to other parts of the body (this is called overall survival). They followed the women for a really long time, about 6 years on average.

What they found was that, after 5 years, both groups of women had about the same chance of the cancer not coming back or dying from it. The new treatment didn't make a big difference in keeping the cancer away or helping the women live longer compared to the regular treatment.

So, the conclusion is that for women with early breast cancer, the new treatment (Treatment A) isn't better than the regular treatment (Comparator B) based on what they measured in this study. Both treatments seem to work about the same.

In short, the study showed that the new treatment didn't help more than the regular treatment in this case."

2. **How long the effect lasted**: The women who took Treatment A kept their cancer from growing for about 9.9 months on average, while those who took Comparator B only managed about 5.8 months. This is called progression-free survival, and it's a measure of how long the treatment keeps the cancer from getting worse.

Overall response rate (ORR) was 32% in both arms, and overall survival (OS) was not different between arms (P = .983). Time to treatment failure (TTF; defined as discontinuation, progressive disease, death as a result of any cause, or the start of a new anticancer therapy) was superior in the treatment A arm (P = .059).

The median time to treatment failure (TTF; defined as discontinuation, progressive disease, death as a result of any cause, or the start of a new anticancer therapy) was 4.24 months (95% CI, 4.11 to 4.44) for treatment A and 4.07 months (95% CI, 3.81 to 4.24) for comparator B, p=0.059. The medial overall survival was 19.29 months (95% CI, 15.57 to 23.59) for treatment A vs. 21.45 months (95% CI, 17.12 to 24.94), p=0.983. Hematologic toxicity was similar in both arms, except for grades 3 to 4 leukopenia (treatment A, 78%; comparator B, 66%; P = .025) and transfusions (treatment A, 17%; comparator B, 7%; P = .0051) and grades 3 to 4 diarrhea (treatment A, 8%; comparator B, 18%; p=0.009), mucositis (treatment A, 4%; comparator B, 15%; p<.001), and hand‐and‐foot syndrome (treatment A, 0%; comparator B, 26%, p<.001). 13% in treatment A arm and 27% in the comparator B arm discontinued because of drug‐related adverse events (P = .002).
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than comparator B for patients with advanced breast cancer.",no_spin,"Sure, let's break it down into simpler terms:

Imagine there was a study where doctors wanted to see if a new medicine (let's call it Treatment A) worked better than a medicine they already had (comparator B) for women with a serious kind of breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.

They took 305 women and divided them into two groups, giving half Treatment A and the other half comparator B. The main thing they wanted to know was how long the women could live without their cancer getting worse (this is called progression-free survival).

After looking at the results, they found that both treatments worked about the same. The new medicine didn't make the women live longer than the old medicine.

They also checked how many women had side effects from the treatments. Treatment A had more side effects like low white blood cell counts, needing blood transfusions, and diarrhea, but it also had fewer side effects like hand-and-foot syndrome.

In the end, 13% of the women on Treatment A stopped taking it because of side effects, while 27% of the women on comparator B stopped for the same reason.

The conclusion is that the new medicine didn't work better than the old medicine for this type of breast cancer. So, doctors won't use it instead of the old medicine just because it's new. They need to see more proof that it works better before they decide to use"
42,20087643,A bupropion smoking cessation clinical trial for cancer patients,Cancer Causes Control,"Objective:
Many cancer patients continue to smoke postdiagnosis, yet there have been few smoking cessation trials for this population.
Methods:
This double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial randomized 246 cancer patients to 9 weeks of placebo or treatment A, stratifying by pre‐treatment depression symptoms. In addition, all patients received transdermal nicotine and behavioral counseling. Primary outcomes were 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence, biochemically confirmed, at the end of treatment (Week 12), and at 6 months post quit day (Week 27). Additional outcomes included: withdrawal, affect, quality of life, compliance, and side effects.
Results:
There was no main effect of treatment A vs. placebo on abstinence (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.38‐4.81, p =0.64). At week 12, the abstinence rates were 24.2% for placebo and 27.2% for treatment A; at week 27, the abstinence rates were 17.4% for placebo and 18.4% for treatment A. There was no statistically significant difference between placebo and treatment A in average daily smoking to week 12 (mean [SE] 5.2 [0.95] vs. 5.3 [1.0]; p=0.97); and to week 27 (mean [SE] 5.4 [0.88] vs. 6.1 [0.90]; p=0.64). There were no statistically significant difference between placebo and treatment A on changes in withdrawals (p=0.39); negative (p=0.41) and positive affect (p=0.77), and physical (p=0.31) and mental (p=0.42) quality of life.
Conclusion:

Imagine there are people who have cancer and they also smoke cigarettes. Even though doctors know smoking is bad for people with cancer, not many studies have been done to help these people stop smoking.

This study wanted to see if a special treatment (let's call it Treatment A) could help cancer patients stop smoking better than just getting a fake treatment (placebo). The study took 246 cancer patients and gave half of them Treatment A and the other half a fake treatment for 9 weeks.

The main thing they were checking was if more people who got Treatment A stopped smoking for at least 7 days compared to those who got the placebo. They also looked at other things like how the patients felt, how their quality of life changed, and if they had any side effects.

After 9 weeks (which is the end of the treatment), 24.2% of the people who got the placebo and 27.2% of those who got Treatment A stopped smoking for at least 7 days. At 6 months (which is about half a year later), 17.4% of the placebo group and 18.4% of the Treatment A group stopped smoking for at least 7 days.

41,20087643,A bupropion smoking cessation clinical trial for cancer patients,Cancer Causes Control,"Objective:
Many cancer patients continue to smoke postdiagnosis, yet there have been few smoking cessation trials for this population. Depression, which is prevalent among cancer patients, may be a barrier to cessation.
Methods:
This double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial randomized 246 cancer patients to 9 weeks of placebo or treatment A, stratifying by pre‐treatment depression symptoms. In addition, all patients received transdermal nicotine and behavioral counseling. Primary outcomes were 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence, biochemically confirmed, at the end of treatment (Week 12), and at 6 months post quit day (Week 27).

Results:
There was no main effect of treatment A vs. placebo on abstinence (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.38‐4.81, p = 0.64). Patients with depression symptoms reported significantly lower abstinence rates vs. patients without depression symptoms (OR = .14, 95% CI: 0.02‐0.80, p=0.03). Treatment A increased abstinence rates, vs. placebo, more for participants with depression vs. those without depression symptoms. For patients with depression symptoms, treatment A reduced withdrawal symptoms and improved quality of life vs. placebo.
Conclusion:
For patients with depression symptoms, treatment increases abstinence rates, lowers withdrawal, and increases quality of life. However, abstinence rates among patients with depression symptoms were low vs. patients without depression symptoms, who exhibited similar abstinence rates when treated with treatment A or transdermal nicotine and counseling alone. These results can guide future smoking cessation intervention studies with cancer patients.",spin,"Sure, let's break it down into simpler terms:

**The Study:**
Imagine there are people who have cancer and they also smoke. Even though they know smoking is bad for their health, it's really hard for them to stop. The researchers wanted to see if a special treatment could help these people quit smoking better than just giving them patches (to help with withdrawal) and talking to them about quitting.

**What They Did:**
They took 246 people with cancer and randomly divided them into two groups. One group got a special treatment (let's call it ""treatment A"") and the other group got a fake treatment (placebo). Everyone got nicotine patches and advice on how to quit smoking, no matter which group they were in.

**What They Found:**
The special treatment didn't make a big difference overall in helping people quit smoking compared to the fake treatment. In other words, the odds of quitting were only slightly better with the special treatment, and it wasn't enough to be sure it was really working (because the number wasn't very high, and the confidence interval was wide, meaning the result could have been due to chance).

**What's Important:**
The interesting part is what happened with people who felt sad or depressed before the study started (they had depression symptoms). For these folks, the special treatment did seem to help a bit more than the fake treatment. It helped them feel less like they wanted to smoke ("

We aimed to compare overall survival in patients receiving treatment A or comparator B.
Methods:
This was an open‐label randomized trial undertaken in 50 centres across eight countries. 1006 treatment‐naive patients diagnosed with advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma were randomly allocated (1 to 1) by minimization to receive comparator B or treatment A. Treatment was not masked. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Treatment groups were compared with a non‐stratified log‐ rank test. Analysis was by intention to treat.

Findings:
502 patients were randomly assigned to receive comparator B and 504 to receive combined treatment A. Median follow‐up was 37.2 months (24.8‐52.3). Median overall survival was 18.8 months (17.0‐23.2) for patients receiving comparator B versus 18.6 months (16.5‐20.6) for those receiving treatment A.

Imagine there was a study where doctors wanted to see if using treatment A or a different treatment called comparator B is better for people with a serious kind of cancer called advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma. This study was done in 50 places around the world and included 1006 patients who had never had this type of cancer before.

The patients were randomly chosen to get either treatment A or comparator B. The doctors weren't trying to hide which treatment each patient got, which is why it's called an ""open-label"" trial. The main thing they wanted to know was how long the patients lived after getting the treatment, which is called overall survival.

The study found that, on average, both treatments made the patients live about the same amount of time. The difference in how long they lived was very small, with treatment A giving them about 0.3% more time at one year and 2.7% more time at three years compared to comparator B. However, this difference wasn't big enough to be sure that one treatment is definitely better than the other.

Even though treatment A didn't make people live longer on average, some patients did have a good response to it. This means that for some people, treatment A might make their cancer go away for a longer period, which is important. The tricky part is figuring out who those people are.

Cancer‐related fatigue is a debilitating symptom affecting psychosocial functioning and quality of life in 70% to 100% of cancer patients during and after treatment. The authors examined the effect of 200 mg of treatment A compared to placebo on the severity of cancer‐related fatigue.
Methods:
The authors conducted a multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐ controlled, phase 3, clinical trial to examine the effect of treatment A on patient‐ reported fatigue in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. A sample of 877 cancer patients beginning chemotherapy at 23 geographically separate University of Rochester Cancer Center (URCC) Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) affiliates were assessed for fatigue.

ANCOVA showed a significant interaction between treatment condition and baseline fatigue (P = .017), where patients with severe baseline fatigue (n = 458) benefited from treatment A, whereas patients with mild or moderate fatigue did not. Treatment A had no statistically significant effect on depression (P > .05).
Conclusions:
Treatment A may be useful in controlling cancer‐related fatigue in patients who present with severe fatigue but is not useful in patients with mild or moderate fatigue.",spin,"Sure, let's break it down into simpler terms:

Imagine there's a medicine called ""Treatment A"" that doctors think might help people feel less tired when they have cancer. This tiredness is really tough and affects how they feel and live their daily lives.

The scientists did a big study to see if Treatment A really helps. They got 877 people with cancer who were starting a special medicine called chemotherapy. They wanted to know if Treatment A made these people feel less tired compared to a pretend medicine (placebo) that doesn't do anything.

Here's what they found:

- Most of the people (about 70% to 100%) who have cancer feel very tired because of their illness.
- In this study, 631 people gave good enough information for the scientists to analyze.
- When they looked closely, they saw that if someone had really bad tiredness (severe fatigue) at the start of the study, Treatment A helped them feel less tired.
- But if their tiredness was just a little or moderate, Treatment A didn't make a big difference.
- Also, Treatment A didn't help with feeling sad or down (which is called depression), according to the study.

So, the scientists concluded that Treatment A is good for helping people with severe cancer-related tiredness, but it doesn't help much if the tiredness is not very bad. They also said to be careful because sometimes studies"

Imagine there was a big study where doctors wanted to see if giving a new medicine (let's call it Treatment A) along with the usual treatment for a type of cancer called acute myeloid leukemia (AML) would work better than just using the usual treatment alone. This study was done in different places (multicenter phase III clinical trial) and included 260 patients.

The study had two groups: one group got the usual treatment plus the new medicine (Treatment A), and the other group just got the usual treatment. They wanted to check if the new medicine helped more people get better (efficacy) and if it was safe.

The main things they looked at were:
1. How many people in each group completely got better after starting treatment (complete response to induction).
2. How many people in each group were still alive after 3 years (overall survival at 3 years).

The results showed that:
- In the group with the new medicine, 62.5% of patients got completely better, while in the group without the new medicine, 64.6% got completely better. This difference wasn't big enough to say the new medicine made a real difference (p=0.72).
- The chance of being alive after 3 years was also similar in both groups, with 25.6% in the new medicine group and 31"

Imagine there was a big study where doctors tested a new medicine (let's call it Treatment A) to help people with a type of cancer called Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). This study was done in different places (multicenter) and was pretty serious because it was a phase III trial, which means it was done to see if the medicine really works and is safe.

The study found that Treatment A helped when it was used along with the usual treatment to start fighting the cancer. Both groups of patients (those who got Treatment A and those who didn't) had similar types of cancer and other characteristics.

One important thing Treatment A did was make the problem of having too few white blood cells (leukopenia) less severe and not last as long.

When they looked at how long the patients lived (survival), they found that over three years, the survival rate was similar for both groups. But, for patients whose cancer had certain features (myeloblastic features), the group that got Treatment A did a little better.

The study also found that being female, using just one cycle of the treatment, and using Treatment A itself were things that made a difference in survival. Female patients survived a little longer than male patients.

However, the researchers said they need to look more closely at the DNA of the cancer (cytogenetic"

A two‐arm, double‐blind, randomized trial was performed to evaluate the effect of treatment A on acute skin‐related toxicity in patients undergoing breast or chest wall radiotherapy.
Methods and material:
Patients with ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast carcinoma who were undergoing external beam radiotherapy to the breast or chest wall were randomly assigned to apply treatment A or placebo cream daily. The primary study endpoint was the provider assessed maximal grade of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, radiation dermatitis.
Results:
A total of 176 patients were enrolled between September 21, 2007, and December 7, 2007. The provider assessed primary endpoint showed no difference in the mean maximum grade of radiation dermatitis by treatment arm (1.2+/‐0.85 for treatment A vs. 1.3+/‐0.80 for placebo; p = .18). Severe radiation dermatitis concerned 4 (5%) in both arms; p=.97. The worst grade of any type of toxicity were respectively in the placebo and treatment A groups 9% vs. 2% for grade 3 or 4: 24% vs. 30% for grade 2; 61% vs. 40% for grade 1; and 6% vs. 27% for grade 0; p = .04. For the patient‐reported outcome, the maximum Skindex‐16 score for the treatment A group did not differ between the MMF arm (mean = 1.4) vs. placebo arm (mean = 1.7); p=0.07. The mean score for overall quality of life was 8.3 for treatment A vs. 8.4 for placebo; P> .05. The maximal Skin Toxicity Assessment Tool score was respectively in the treatment A and placebo group 1.5 vs. 2.1 for discomfort or burning (p=.02); 1.5 vs. 2.2 for itching (p = .002), 1.0 vs. 1.4 for pulling (p=.07) and 2.1 vs. 2.5 for discomfort or tenderness (p=.11).

Imagine there was a study where doctors wanted to see if a special cream (treatment A) could help prevent skin irritation in people who were getting radiation therapy for breast or chest wall cancer. This study was set up so that half the people got the cream and the other half got a fake cream (placebo) that didn't do anything.

The doctors checked to see how bad the skin irritation got in both groups. They used a scale to rate how bad the irritation was, from 0 (no irritation) to 4 (very bad irritation). They found that, on average, the irritation was about the same in both groups. There were a few people in each group who had really bad irritation, but it wasn't because of the cream they were using.

They also asked the patients themselves to rate how their skin felt using a different scale. For this scale, the treatment A group and the placebo group had similar scores, but just barely higher for the placebo group. When it came to how the patients felt overall about their quality of life, there wasn't a big difference between the two groups.

This study was set up like a science experiment, where some patients got the cream and others got a fake cream (placebo) to compare the results.

The main thing they looked at was how bad the skin irritation got, measured by a scale called the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0. They also checked if the skin irritation was bad enough to be considered serious (Grade 3 or higher) and kept an eye on any other side effects.

The results showed that, overall, the cream didn't make a big difference in how bad the skin irritation got. The average score for skin irritation was almost the same for both the cream group and the placebo group (1.2 for the cream vs. 1.3 for the placebo).

However, when they looked closer, they found that the placebo group had more itching (which is a type of skin irritation). This was the main reason why the placebo group had a slightly higher average score for skin irritation.

For the patients who used the cream, they reported less itching, irritation, and annoyance with skin problems. They also felt that their skin issues didn't last as long or come back as much.

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment A in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer (OC).
Methods:
Patients with platinum‐refractory or ‐resistant primary or secondary) OC were randomized to receive treatment A and PLD at 50 mg/m2 intravenously or PLD alone at 50 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 every 28 days until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression‐free survival (PFS). Other end points were objective response rate and safety. The study was originally planned for 244 patients. The trial was temporarily placed on hold after 125 patients were randomized while the results of another trial were being reviewed and the sponsor decided not to resume enrollment. The interim analysis became the final analysis.
Results:
The median PFS was 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD (n = 65) versus 3.7 months for PLD (n = 60) (hazards ratio, 0.92; P = 0.7243). A preplanned subgroup analysis showed that 75 patients with platinum‐refractory or primary platinum‐resistant OC had a median PFS of 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD versus 2.9 months for PLD (hazards ratio, 0.55; P = 0.0425). Hematologic adverse events were 66% on the treatment A + PLD arm versus 44% on the PLD arm, manageable with dose reductions. Nonhematologic adverse events were similar for both arms. The incidence of palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis was lower on treatment A + PLD (23%, 31%, respectively) versus (39%, 49%, respectively) on PLD.
Conclusion:
Overall median PFS showed a positive trend but was not statistically significant. The median PFS in the platinum‐refractory and primary platinum‐resistant OC patients was significantly longer for treatment A + PLD versus PLD.

Patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagogastric junction (AEG II and III) were randomly assigned to treatment A followed by surgery or to surgery alone. To detect with 80% power an improvement in median survival from 17 months with surgery alone to 24 months with treatment A, 282 events were required.
Results:
This trial was stopped for poor accrual after 144 patients were randomly assigned (72:72); 52.8% patients had tumors located in the proximal third of the stomach, including AEG type II and III. The International Union against Cancer R0 resection rate was 81.9% after treatment A as compared with 66.7% with surgery alone (P = .036). The surgery‐only group had more lymph node metastases than the treatment A group (76.5% v 61.4%; P = .018).

Conclusion:
This trial showed a significantly increased R0 resection rate but failed to demonstrate a survival benefit.

Conclusion:
Treatment A followed by surgery was not more effective than surgery alone on overall survival in patients with locally advanced cancer of the stomach.",no_spin,"Sure, let's break it down into simpler terms:

Imagine there was a study where doctors wanted to see if giving a special treatment (let's call it Treatment A) before doing surgery helped people with a certain kind of stomach cancer live longer. This study was done with 144 patients who had a type of stomach cancer that had spread to nearby areas but hadn't spread to other parts of the body yet.

The patients were divided into two groups: one group got Treatment A first and then had surgery, and the other group just had surgery. The main thing they wanted to know was if the first group lived longer than the second group.

After following the patients for about 4.4 years, they found that on average, people who got Treatment A first lived for 64.6 months (which is about 5.4 years), while those who only had surgery lived for 52.5 months (around 4.4 years). This means that, on average, Treatment A didn't make a big difference in how long people lived. The difference in survival times was not enough to say for sure that Treatment A was better because the numbers were pretty close and the difference wasn't statistically significant (meaning it could have happened by chance).

When they looked at how many people were still alive after 2 years, about 72.7% of the people who got Treatment A were still alive, and 69.9% of those who only"

Scientists did a special sleep study to see if a new kind of treatment (let's call it ""Treatment A"") could help these kids sleep better. They took 227 kids and randomly gave them either Treatment A or a fake treatment (placebo) every night before bedtime for 8 weeks. They wanted to know if Treatment A would make the kids sleep better as measured by a special sleep score called the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).

The main result was that the sleep score didn't change much between the kids who got Treatment A and those who got the placebo. In other words, Treatment A didn't help the kids sleep better according to the main test.

But, when the scientists looked closer at some other questions the kids answered, they found that Treatment A might have helped with feeling less tired and less sleepy. Also, there were a few mild side effects with the placebo that weren't as common with Treatment A, like a slight increase in a liver enzyme called alkaline phosphatase.

Even though the main result wasn't what they hoped for, the scientists think it's still worth looking into Treatment A more closely because it might help with feeling less tired in other ways."

High levels of distress and need for self‐care information by patients commencing chemotherapy suggest that current prechemotherapy education is suboptimal. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of a prechemotherapy education intervention (treatment A) to assess impact on patient distress, treatment‐related concerns, and the prevalence and severity of and bother caused by six chemotherapy side‐effects.
Patients and methods:
One hundred and ninety‐two breast, gastrointestinal, and haematologic cancer patients were recruited before the trial closing prematurely (original target 352). Treatment A was administered before first treatment (intervention 1), 48 h after first treatment (intervention 2), and immediately before second treatment (intervention 3). Patient outcomes were measured at baseline (T1: pre‐education) and immediately preceding treatment cycles 1 (T2) and 3 (T3).
Results:
Treatment A did not significantly reduce patient distress. However, a significant decrease in sensory/psychological (P=0.027) and procedural (P=0.03) concerns, as well as prevalence and severity of and bother due to vomiting (all P=0.001), were observed at T3. In addition, subgroup analysis of patients with elevated distress at T1 indicated a significant decrease (P=0.035) at T2 but not at T3 (P=0.055) in treatment A patients.

They did a special study where they gave some kids this extra information before the first part of their project, 48 hours after starting, and right before the second part.

The study found that while the extra information didn't make the kids feel less stressed overall, it did help them worry less about the parts of the project that were more uncomfortable or scary, like throwing up (which can happen with this treatment). Also, it made the vomiting less severe and less annoying for those who did get sick.

But here's the tricky part: even though the extra information helped a bit, the scientists didn't test it on a big enough group of kids to be sure it would work for everyone. They only tested it on kids with a lot of stress to start with. So, we still need more studies to see if it works for all types of kids, not just the really stressed ones.

In short, the extra information helped a little with some worries and sickness, but we need to check if it works for more kids before we know"

The teachers (doctors) wanted to help these kids feel less stressed before they start the project, so they tried a new way to teach them everything they need to know about the project before they begin.

They did this in three different ways:
1. They taught them everything they needed to know right before they started the project.
2. They taught them 48 hours after they started the project.
3. They taught them right before they were going to start the second part of the project.

They wanted to see if learning all this information before the project made the kids feel less stressed when they were working on it.

The teachers measured how stressed the kids were at the start (before they learned anything), right after they learned the information (at the start of the project), and then again after they had done some work on the project (at the start of the second part).

The results showed that learning the information didn't make the kids feel less stressed overall when they were actually working on the project. The kids were still pretty stressed, with stress levels not changing much whether they got the special teaching or not.
