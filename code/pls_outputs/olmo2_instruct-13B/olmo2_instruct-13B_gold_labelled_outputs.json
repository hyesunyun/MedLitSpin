We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.\nMethods:\nWe randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30\u201070 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization.

Statistical tests were two\u2010sided.\nResults:\n2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66\u20101.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64\u20101.09; P = .177) between the two arms.

        "abstract": "This study was designed to address whether treatment A with chemotherapy provides additional activity compared with chemotherapy alone in breast cancer patients with operable or locally advanced disease. Between January 1997 and January 2002, 211 consecutive patients with T2\u20104, N0\u20101, M0 breast cancer were randomized to receive either epirubicin alone (EPI) or epirubicin plus treatment A. Ki67 expression was evaluated immunohistochemically in tumor specimens obtained before chemotherapy by incision biopsy and at definitive surgery. Tumor shrinkage of >50% was obtained in 76% of patients randomized in the EPI arm and 81.9% of patients randomized in the EPI+treatment A arm (not significant). The corresponding rates of clinical and pathological complete response were 20.2 and 21.9% (not significant), and 4.8 and 6.7% (not significant), respectively. Pathologically complete response was more frequently observed in estrogen receptor (ER)\u2010negative (ER\u2010) tumors (P=0.04) and correlated with elevated baseline Ki67 expression (P<0.01). Both EPI treatment and EPI+treatment A resulted in a significant reduction in Ki67 expression, either in overall patients (P=0.000) or in patients with ER+ breast cancer (P=0.000). The reduction in Ki67 immunostaining in the EPI+treatment A arm was greater than in the EPI arm, leading to a lower Ki67 expression at post\u2010operative residual histology (P=0.0041). The addition of treatment A to epirubicin chemotherapy did not improve the response rate but led to a significantly higher reduction in the Ki67 expression. Baseline elevated Ki67 expression and the ER\u2010 statuses were both associated with a greater chance of obtaining a pathological complete response at residual histology.",

The study included 211 people with this type of breast cancer who were randomly split into two groups. One group got just the regular chemotherapy (EPI), and the other group got the regular chemotherapy plus Treatment A.\n\nBefore starting treatment, doctors checked how fast the cancer cells were growing in the tumors by looking at something called Ki67. They also checked this after the treatments.\n\nThe results showed that the tumors got smaller in most people in both groups, but not by a lot more in one group compared to the other. The number of people whose tumors completely disappeared (called a complete response) was also similar in both groups and wasn't a big difference.\n\nHowever, the study found that the special Treatment A made the cancer cells grow slower, as shown by lower Ki67 levels after treatment. This effect was more noticeable in people whose cancer cells didn't have estrogen receptors (ER-) and in those whose cancer cells were growing very fast before treatment.\n\nIn plain language, the study suggests that adding Treatment A to regular chemotherapy doesn't make tumors shrink much more, but it does make the cancer cells grow slower. This effect is stronger in certain types of breast cancer. So, while the main goal wasn't achieved, there's still a positive side effect that could be important for some patients"

In the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm among women with ASC or LSIL, the PPV (positive predictive value) of biopsies indicated by ntervention A was 15.0% and the PPV of biopsies indicated by colposcopy was 15.2%.

        "abstract": "Purpose:\nThis phase III randomized open\u2010label clinical trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment A versus comparator B as first\u2010line treatment for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in postmenopausal women.\nPatients and methods:\nThe study was conducted at 81 centers and enrolled postmenopausal patients with measurable hormone\u2010sensitive metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer. Prior adjuvant chemotherapy and/or comparator B were allowed. One previous chemotherapy regimen and no prior hormone therapy for advanced disease were permitted. Patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment A or comparator B until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred.\nResults:\nA total of 371 patients enrolled at 79 sites (182 treatment A, 189 comparator B) were included in the analysis. Both treatments were generally well tolerated without major toxicity. Overall response rate was greater for treatment A than for comparator B (46% v 31%; odds ratio = 1.85; 95% CI, 1.21 to 2.82; P = .005). Median progression\u2010free survival (PFS) was longer with treatment A (9.9 months; 95% CI, 8.7 to 11.8 months) than with comparator B (5.8 months; 95% CI, 5.3 to 8.1 months). However, these early differences (Wilcoxon P = .028) did not translate to a longer\u2010term benefit in PFS, the primary study end point (log\u2010rank P = .121). There was also no difference in survival between both study arms.\nConclusion:\nTreatment A is an effective and well\u2010tolerated first\u2010line hormonal treatment for postmenopausal women with MBC and offers significant early improvement in time to tumor progression when compared with comparator B.",

This test is called a clinical trial.\n\nThe trial was done at 81 different places and included 371 women who fit the description. The goal was to see if Treatment A was better at making the cancer shrink or stop growing for a while and if it was safe to use.\n\nThe results showed that more women's cancer shrank with Treatment A than with Comparator B. Also, the cancer took longer to start growing again for women who got Treatment A compared to those who got Comparator B. However, even though the cancer took longer to grow back at first for the women who got Treatment A, in the long run, it didn't make a big difference in how long they lived compared to the women who got Comparator B.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that Treatment A is a good option because it helps the cancer shrink and it's safe to use.

        "abstract": "Background:\nWe aimed to compare overall survival in patients receiving treatment A or comparator B.\nMethods:\nThis was an open\u2010label randomized trial undertaken in 50 centres across eight countries. 1006 treatment\u2010naive patients diagnosed with advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma were randomly allocated (1 to 1) by minimization to receive comparator B or treatment A. Treatment was not masked. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Treatment groups were compared with a non\u2010stratified log\u2010 rank test. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN XXXX.\nFindings:\n502 patients were randomly assigned to receive comparator B and 504 to receive combined treatment A. Median follow\u2010up was 37.2 months (24.8\u201052.3). Median overall survival was 18.8 months (17.0\u201023.2) for patients receiving comparator B versus 18.6 months (16.5\u201020.6) for those receiving treatment A. Overall survival did not differ between the two groups (hazard ratio 1.05 [95% CI 0.90\u20101.21], p=0.55; absolute difference 0.3% (\u20105.1 to 5.6) at 1 year and 2.7% (\u20108.2 to 2.9) at 3 years). There was no evidence that progression free survival differed statistically between treatment groups (HR 1.02 [0.89\u20131.16]; p=0.81). During treatment significantly more grade 3 and 4 toxic effects were associated with combined treatment A than with comparator B (269 patients [53%] vs. 183 patients [36%]; p<0.0001). Serious adverse events were reported in 113 (23%) patients receiving comparator B and 131 (26%) of those receiving combined treatment A.\nInterpretation:\nTreatment A was not more effective than comparator B on overall survival in patients diagnosed with advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma.",

The AUC over the 8 weeks for treatment A was 51.4 (SD = 16), while that for placebo was 49.7 (SD = 15), with a P value of 0.6957. A supplemental, exploratory analysis revealed that several fatigue end points, as measured by the BFI and POMS, were significantly better for those taking treatment A over placebo. Participants also reported less trouble with sleep and less drowsiness on treatment A than placebo. There were no significant differences in toxicities as measured by self\u2010report or the CTCAE except for mild alkaline phosphatase increases, which were slightly more common in the placebo group. This study failed to provide data to support the hypothesis that treatment A, at bedtime could improve sleep as measured by the PSQI. However, exploratory analyses revealed improvement in some secondary outcomes, such as fatigue. Further research with treatment A exploring physiologic effects in oncology symptom management may be warranted.",

        "abstract": "Sleep disorders are a substantial problem for cancer survivors, with prevalence estimates ranging from 23% to 61%. Although numerous prescription hypnotics are available, few are approved for long\u2010term use or have demonstrated benefit in this circumstance. Hypnotics may have unwanted side effects and are costly, and cancer survivors often wish to avoid prescription drugs. New options with limited side effects are needed. The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of a treatment A for sleep in people with cancer who were undergoing cancer treatment. Participants were randomized to receive treatment A or placebo orally 1 hour before bedtime for 8 weeks. The primary end point was area under the curve (AUC) of the overall Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Secondary outcomes included the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Toxicity was evaluated with both self\u2010reported numeric analogue scale questions and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0. Questionnaires were completed at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks. A total of 227 patients were randomized into this study between March 19, 2004, and March 9, 2007. Twenty\u2010three patients withdrew before starting the study treatment. Primary end\u2010point data were available on 119 patients (62 receiving treatment A and 57 receiving placebo). Baseline characteristics and baseline patient reported outcomes were well balanced between arms. The AUC over the 8 weeks for treatment A was 51.4 (SD = 16 and for placebo was 49.7 (SD = 15), with a P value of 0.7. The FOSQ was not statistically significantly different between groups. There was no statistically significant difference between groups for the POMS week 8 treatment A 6.9 vs. placebo 6.0; p=0.90. For the BFI at week 8 the treatment A and placebo arm scored respectively for fatigue now 22.1 vs. 10.5; p<0.01; for usual fatigue 19.4 vs. 10.0; p=0.05; for worst fatigue 14.8 vs. 12.4; p=0.65; and for activity inference 12.3 vs. 10.8; p=0.75.There were no significant differences in toxicities as measured by self\u2010report or the CTCAE. Treatment A was not more effective than placebo on sleep quality in patients who were undergoing cancer treatment.",

Doctors wanted to see if a special medicine (let's call it Treatment A) could help them sleep better. They gathered 227 friends who were going through cancer treatment and divided them into two groups. One group got the special medicine before bed for 8 weeks, and the other group got a pretend medicine (a placebo) that doesn't actually do anything.\n\nAfter 8 weeks, they checked how well everyone was sleeping using a special sleep score. The results showed that the special medicine didn't help the friends sleep any better than the pretend medicine. They also looked at how tired the friends felt and their mood, but again, the special medicine didn't make a big difference compared to the pretend medicine.\n\nNo one had bad side effects from the special medicine, and it didn't make anyone feel worse. So, based on this study, the special medicine didn't help the friends who had cancer sleep better. It's important to remember that just because this medicine didn't work, it doesn't mean other treatments won't help. Scientists will keep looking for better ways to help people sleep when they're going through cancer treatment."
