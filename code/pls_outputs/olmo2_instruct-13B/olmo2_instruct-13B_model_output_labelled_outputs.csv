Randomized trial of fenretinide to prevent second breast malignancy in women with early breast cancer",J Natl Cancer Inst,"Background:
Treatment A has been shown to inhibit breast carcinogenesis in preclinical studies. We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.
Methods:
We randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30‐70 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66‐1.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64‐1.09; P = .177) between the two arms. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs (38 in the treatment A arm versus 40 in the control arm), incidence of distant metastasis (HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.79‐1.22; P = .858), and all‐cause mortality (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.92‐1.48; P = .215).
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than no treatment in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.",no_spin,"Okay, so imagine there's a medicine called Treatment A that scientists thought might stop new breast cancers from growing in women who already had breast cancer. They wanted to see if this medicine really worked, so they did a big study with 2972 women who had either very early breast cancer or a condition that could lead to it.

These women were split into two groups: one group took Treatment A every day for 5 years, and the other group didn't take anything. The scientists made sure that who went into each group was completely random, like picking names out of a hat.

Everyone in the study got checked the same way, and the people looking at the tests didn't know who was taking the medicine and who wasn't, to make sure the results were fair.

After watching these women for about 8 years, the scientists looked to see if fewer women in the Treatment A group got a new breast cancer or a return of their breast cancer compared to those who didn't take the medicine. They also checked if the women in the Treatment A group had fewer cancers in other parts of their body, fewer cases where the cancer spread to other places, and fewer deaths from any cause.

What they found was that there was no big difference between the two groups. The number of women who got a new breast cancer or a return of their breast cancer was about the same in both groups. The same goes for cancers in other organs, cancer spreading to other places"

There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs, incidence of distant metastasis, and all‐cause mortality.

But here's where it gets a little more interesting: they noticed that the medicine seemed to help premenopausal women (women who still get their periods) a bit. These women taking Treatment A were less likely to get a new breast cancer in either breast compared to those who didn't take the medicine. However, for postmenopausal women (women who no longer get their periods), the medicine didn't seem to make a difference and might have even made"

It is uncertain whether treatment A provides additional benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. This trial was initiated to explore this question.
Patients and methods:
Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization. The two end points of interest for this study were time to treatment failure (TTF) and survival time.
Results:
Median survival was 30.0 months for chemotherapy alone and 29.3 months treatment A and chemotherapy, p=0.834. Time to treatment failure (TTF) was 13.4 months for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with 10.3 month for chemotherapy alone patients (P = .087). The response rates (complete response and partial response) was 69.2% of for patients who received chemotherapy alone and 68.9% for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy, P =.99.

Three infectious deaths occurred in patients receiving treatment A with chemotherapy.

Imagine there's a group of people with a very serious kind of cancer that has spread to different parts of their body. Doctors wanted to see if adding a new treatment (let's call it Treatment A) to the usual cancer treatment (chemotherapy) would help these patients live longer or feel better.

So, they took 231 patients and split them into two groups. One group got just chemotherapy, and the other group got chemotherapy plus Treatment A.

- The cancer took a bit longer to get worse in the group that got Treatment A with chemotherapy (13.4 months) compared to those who got just chemotherapy (10.3 months), but this difference wasn't big enough to be sure it wasn't just by chance.
- About the same number of patients in both groups had their cancer shrink a lot or a little (around 70% in each group).

Patients and methods:
Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with estrogen receptor (ER)‐positive or ER‐unknown metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization.
Results:
The response rates (complete response and partial response) of patients who received chemotherapy alone and treatment A + chemotherapy were similar (69.2% v 68.9%, respectively; P =.99). Time to treatment failure (TTF) was slightly longer for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone patients (13.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.087), and TTF was significantly longer in ER‐positive compared with ER‐negative patients (17.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.048). However, ER status had no effect on overall survival (30.0 months for chemotherapy alone v 29.3 months for treatment A + chemotherapy).
Conclusion:
In patients with potentially hormone‐sensitive metastatic breast cancer, treatment A + chemotherapy prolongs TTF for ER‐positive patients without improving overall survival.",spin,"Sure, here's a simplified explanation:

Imagine there are two groups of people with a serious kind of breast cancer that has spread. One group gets a special treatment (let's call it Treatment A) along with regular chemotherapy, while the other group just gets regular chemotherapy. The main goal was to see if adding Treatment A makes a big difference in helping these people.

After watching these patients for some time, researchers found that the number of people who got better (either completely or a little bit) was almost the same in both groups. So, Treatment A didn't seem to make a big difference in how many people got better.

However, the time before the cancer started to get worse again was a tiny bit longer for those who got Treatment A along with chemotherapy. But, this difference wasn't big enough to be sure it wasn't just by chance.

Also, it was found that people whose cancer cells had a certain protein (called estrogen receptor) were more likely to have their cancer last longer before getting worse, no matter which treatment they got. But, interestingly, having this protein didn't change how long they lived overall.

In the end, the researchers concluded that for people with a type of breast cancer that might respond to hormones, adding Treatment A to chemotherapy didn't help them live longer, but it did make the cancer take a bit longer to get worse.

So, in simple terms, the study shows that adding Treatment A"

Efficacy and safety of treatment A was compared with comparator B in a group of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, without previous systemic therapy for advanced breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
The study was a prospective double‐blind randomized trial. All treated patients presented with positive estrogen receptors. Main end points were response rates, toxicity profile analysis, time to progression and survival. WHO and ECOG criteria were employed for response evaluation while toxicity was assessed according to WHO guidelines. Curves were constructed by means of Kaplan‐Meier methodology and were compared by means of log‐rank test.
Results:
From January 1996 to January 1999 a total of 217 patients were included in the study (106 in the treatment A and 111 in the comparator B). Both groups of patients were homogeneous regarding the main prognostic factors. A response rate of 64% (68/106) was observed in the treatment A group as compared with a 52% (58/111) in the comparator B group. Median times to progression and overall survival were not significantly different. A lower incidence of undesirable effects was appreciated in the treatment A arm.
Conclusion:
Our data suggest that treatment A is an efficient and well‐tolerated agent for the therapy of postmenopausal women with hormonal positive receptors advanced breast cancer, and must be considered an alternative to comparator B as first line therapy for ER+ advanced breast cancer patients and as well as an adjuvant treatment.",spin,"Okay, let's break it down into simpler terms:

Imagine there are two types of medicine (let's call them Medicine A and Medicine B) that doctors want to test to see which one is better for women who have breast cancer that has spread and who have already gone through menopause. These women haven't tried any other treatments for their advanced breast cancer yet.

The scientists did a special kind of study where they randomly picked some women to try Medicine A and some to try Medicine B, and neither the doctors nor the patients knew who was getting which medicine (this is called a ""double-blind randomized trial""). They wanted to see how well each medicine worked, if it had bad side effects, how long it took for the cancer to get worse, and how long the women lived.

They found that Medicine A made the cancer shrink in 64 out of 106 women, while Medicine B made it shrink in 58 out of 111 women. This means Medicine A seemed to work a bit better. The time it took for the cancer to get worse and how long the women lived didn't seem to be very different between the two medicines.

The good news is that Medicine A didn't cause as many bad side effects as Medicine B.

So, the conclusion is that Medicine A seems to be a good choice because it works well and doesn't cause as many bad side effects. It could be a good first treatment for women with this kind of"

The results showed that the number of women who got better from Treatment A (64%) was a bit more than those who got better from Comparator B (52%). However, this difference wasn't big enough to say for sure that one treatment was better than the other.

Conclusion:
Treatment A was at least as effective as comparator B, with efficacy end points slightly favoring treatment A. Treatment A represents an additional treatment option for postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer whose disease progresses on tamoxifen therapy.",spin,"Sure, here's a simplified explanation:

Imagine there are two special treatments, Treatment A and Treatment B, that doctors are testing to see which one works better for helping people with a serious kind of breast cancer that has already spread and didn't get better with another medicine called tamoxifen.

The study had 400 people who were all women who had gone through menopause and were chosen randomly to get either Treatment A or Treatment B. The main thing they wanted to know was how long it took for the cancer to start growing again after starting each treatment (this is called Time to Progression or TTP).

The results showed that both treatments were pretty similar in how long it took for the cancer to start growing again. The average time was a bit longer for Treatment A, but not by much. About 17.5% of people using either treatment had their cancer shrink or stay the same size for a while.

Treatment A also seemed to help people who responded to the treatment stay without cancer growing for a longer time compared to Treatment B. Both treatments were safe and didn't cause too many problems for the patients.

In conclusion, Treatment A is just as good as Treatment B, and in some ways, it might be a little better. So, it's another option for women who have this kind of breast cancer and have already tried tamoxifen.

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy with or without treatment A primarily on disease‐free survival (DFS) and secondarily on overall survival (OS) in patients with high‐risk operable breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
From June 1997 until November 2000, 604 patients with T1‐3N1M0 or T3N0M0 tumors were randomized to three cycles of epirubicin 110 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of treatment A followed by three cycles of 'intensified' CMF (cyclophosphamide 840 mg/m2, methotrexate 47 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 840 mg/m2) (group A), or to four cycles of epirubicin followed by four cycles of CMF, as in group A (group B). All cycles were given every 2 weeks with granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor support.

Survival rates were 93% and 90%, respectively. Comparison of quality of life outcomes between the two groups showed no statistically significant differences. Both regimens were well tolerated and severe acute side‐effects were infrequent. No cases of severe cardiotoxicity or acute leukemia were recorded.
Conclusion:
Treatment A with a dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy was not more effective than a dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy alone in patients with high‐risk operable breast cancer.",no_spin,"The study looked at two different ways to treat high-risk breast cancer with surgery. The first way was to use a medicine called treatment A three times, then another set of medicines three times, and finally a third set of medicines three times. The second way was to use a different set of medicines four times. Both treatments were given every two weeks and patients got help to make their bodies produce more white blood cells to fight infections.

The study wanted to see if using treatment A made patients live longer without the cancer coming back (called disease-free survival) or live longer overall (called overall survival). After following the patients for a long time, the researchers found that there was no big difference in how long patients lived without the cancer coming back or in how long they lived overall between the two groups. About 80% of the patients in the first group and 77% in the second group were cancer-free after three years.

Both treatments were well-tolerated, meaning most patients didn't have serious side effects. No one had severe heart problems or developed a type of blood cancer.

In simple terms, the study found that adding treatment A to the chemotherapy didn't help patients live longer or better than just using the other set of medicines. Both treatments were safe and didn't cause serious problems."

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy with or without treatment A primarily on disease‐free survival (DFS) and secondarily on overall survival (OS) in patients with high‐risk operable breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
From June 1997 until November 2000, 604 patients with T1‐3N1M0 or T3N0M0 tumors were randomized to three cycles of epirubicin 110 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of treatment A followed by three cycles of 'intensified' CMF (cyclophosphamide 840 mg/m2, methotrexate 47 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 840 mg/m2) (group A), or to four cycles of epirubicin followed by four cycles of CMF, as in group A (group B). All cycles were given every 2 weeks with granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor support.
Results:
A total of 595 patients were eligible. Median follow‐up was 61.7 months for group A and 62 months for group B. The 3‐year DFS was 80% in group A and 77% in group B. Survival rates were 93% and 90%, respectively. The effect of treatment on the hazard of death was different according to hormonal receptor status. More specifically, in patients with negative receptor status the hazard of death was significantly higher for group B (hazard ratio 2.42). Both regimens were well tolerated and severe acute side‐effects were infrequent. No cases of severe cardiotoxicity or acute leukemia were recorded.
Conclusion:
The present study failed to demonstrate a significant difference in DFS or OS between the two treatment groups. However, our study has shown clearly that treatment A can be safely incorporated to dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy.",spin,"The study looked at how well two different cancer treatments worked for people with a certain type of breast cancer that has a high chance of coming back after surgery. The treatments were called group A and group B.

Group A got three cycles of one medicine (epirubicin) followed by three cycles of another medicine (treatment A), and then three cycles of a mix of three other medicines (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil). Group B got four cycles of the first medicine (epirubicin) followed by four cycles of the mix of three other medicines.

Both groups got their treatments every two weeks and had support to help their bodies make more white blood cells, which are important for fighting infections.

After following the patients for a long time, they found that 80% of people in group A and 77% of people in group B were still alive and their cancer hadn't come back after three years. Both treatments were well-tolerated, meaning they didn't cause too many bad side effects.

The conclusion of the study was that neither treatment group A nor B was better than the other in keeping the cancer away or in helping the patients live longer. However, the study showed that adding treatment A to the chemotherapy didn't cause serious problems and was safe to use.

In simple terms, the study compared two different ways of treating breast cancer and found that neither was better than"

To determine whether treatment A, improves survival in patients with brain metastases when used as an adjunct to whole‐brain radiation therapy (WBRT).
Patients and methods:
Patients with brain metastases from solid tumors and a Karnofsky performance score of > or = 70 were randomly assigned to receive WBRT with supplemental oxygen and either treatment A (treatment A arm) or no treatment (control arm). The primary end point was survival.
Results:
The study consisted of 515 eligible patients (treatment A arm, n = 265; control arm, n = 250). The median survival time (MST) was 5.4 months for the treatment A arm versus 4.4 months for the control arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87; P = .16). For the subgroup of patients with non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or breast cancer, the MST was 6.0 and 4.4 months, respectively (HR = 0.82; P = .07). Cox multiple regression analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of death for the treatment A arm in both primary populations. Further analysis indicated that the benefit may be restricted to the subgroup of patients with breast cancer. Response rates (radiographic complete response plus partial response) improved by 7% (P = .10) and 13% (P = .01) for all patients and for NSCLC and breast cancer patients in the treatment A arm, respectively. The most common severe adverse event in patients treated with treatment A was hypoxemia, which was reversible and effectively managed with supplemental oxygen in most patients.
Conclusion:
The addition of treatment A to WBRT may improve response rates and survival in patients with brain metastases, particularly metastases from breast cancer. A confirmatory trial for breast cancer patients has been initiated.",spin,"The study looked at whether adding a special treatment (let's call it Treatment A) to a regular brain cancer treatment helps people live longer. The regular treatment is like a strong flashlight shining on the brain to kill cancer cells. The special Treatment A was given to some patients along with this strong flashlight treatment, while others just got the strong flashlight treatment alone.

The study included 515 people who had cancer that had spread to their brain from somewhere else in their body. Some got Treatment A, and some did not. The researchers wanted to see who lived longer.

The results showed that, on average, people who got Treatment A lived about a month longer than those who didn't (5.4 months compared to 4.4 months). But this difference wasn't big enough to be sure it wasn't just by chance (the chance was 16%).

For people with lung cancer or breast cancer, the difference was a bit bigger, but still not completely sure (7 months for lung cancer patients with Treatment A, 4.4 months without, and 6 months for breast cancer patients with Treatment A, 4.4 months without).

The special Treatment A also seemed to help more people's cancer shrink or get smaller, especially in those with breast cancer.

The most common side effect of Treatment A was trouble breathing, but it was usually fixed by giving extra oxygen.

The researchers randomly picked some patients to get Treatment A along with their regular treatment, and they picked others to just get the regular treatment without the extra one. The main thing they wanted to know was if Treatment A helped people live longer.

They also looked at how well the tumors responded to the treatments and whether the tumors grew back in the brain or not. They found that the tumors responded about the same in both groups, and there wasn't a big difference in how often the tumors grew back in the brain.

About 16% of the patients in the Treatment A group and 15% in the regular treatment group had their quality of life stay the same or get better after 6 months. The most common bad side effect in the Treatment A group was trouble breathing because of not getting enough oxygen.

To compare treatment A and comparator B in node‐positive, operable breast cancer patients.
Methods and materials:
This was a randomized, multicenter, phase III trial enrolling 638 eligible women with prior breast surgery and positive axillary dissection. Patients in Arm A received treatment A, with concomitant radiotherapy (50 Gy +/‐ 10‐20‐Gy boost). Patients in Arm B received comparator B, with subsequent radiotherapy.
Results:
Median treatment durations were 64 and 126 days (Arms A and B, respectively), with no significant difference in overall or disease‐free survival. Five‐year locoregional relapse‐free survival favored patients with conservative surgery (two thirds of the population), with less local and / or regional recurrence in Arm A than in Arm B (3% vs. 9%; p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis in this subgroup showed a 2.8‐fold increased risk of locoregional recurrence with comparator B, independent of other prognostic factors (p = 0.027). Febrile neutropenia and Grade 3‐4 leukopenia were significantly more frequent in Arm A. Subclinical left ventricular ejection fraction events at 1 year were more frequent with treatment A (p = 0.02).
Conclusion:
Treatment A has significantly better locoregional control in node‐positive breast cancer after conservative surgery and 50% shorter treatment, albeit with slightly more acute toxicity.",spin,"The study looked at two ways to treat breast cancer in women who had surgery before and whose cancer had spread to the lymph nodes. The first treatment, called Treatment A, was given along with radiation therapy right away. The second treatment, called Comparator B, was given after the radiation therapy.

The study found that:

- The treatment lasted about 64 days for those who got Treatment A and about 126 days for those who got Comparator B.
- There was no big difference in how long the women lived or how long they stayed cancer-free between the two treatments.
- However, women who had a smaller surgery (called conservative surgery) and got Treatment A had less chance of the cancer coming back in the same area or spreading to nearby areas compared to those who got Comparator B. This difference was statistically significant, meaning it's not likely due to chance.
- Women who got Treatment A were more likely to have side effects like a high fever and low white blood cell count.
- Some women who got Treatment A had a small drop in how well their heart pumps blood, but this wasn't life-threatening.

In simple terms, the study shows that Treatment A helps keep the cancer from coming back in the same area or spreading nearby more than Comparator B, especially for women who had a smaller surgery. However, Treatment A can cause more side effects. So, it's a bit better for stopping the cancer from spreading locally but might make you"

The main goal was to see which treatment helps the women live longer without the cancer coming back.

After watching these women for five years, the researchers found that:

- About 83 out of 100 women in Arm A were cancer-free at five years, and 79 out of 100 in Arm B were cancer-free. The difference wasn't big enough to say one treatment was clearly better.
- The same number of women died in both groups.
- The cancer didn't come back in the same place (local recurrence) more often in one group than the other, but it happened a little more in Arm A (3%) than in Arm B (7%), and this difference was just barely significant.
- Some side effects were more common in Arm A, like a serious kind of low blood cell count and heart problems.

To assess whether the use of intervention A as an adjunct to colposcopy increases the detection of biopsy confirmed CIN 2, 3 (high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia).
Methods:
This is a multicenter two‐arm randomized trial comparing colposcopy alone with colposcopy plus intervention A. Patients were recruited from 13 colposcopy clinics in a variety of practice settings. 2299 women referred for the evaluation of an abnormal cervical cytology were randomized with stratification by cytology; subsequently 113 women were excluded for a variety of reasons. The main study outcomes were differences in true‐positive rates (CIN 2, 3 and cancer identified) and false‐positive rates between the study arms.
Results:
The true‐positive (TP) rates were 14.4% vs. 11.4% (p=0.035, one‐sided) for the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm compared to colposcopy‐only arm, respectively, in women with either an atypical squamous cell (ASC) or low‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) cytology result. TP rates were similar between the two arms among women referred for the evaluation of HSIL (high‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). The 26.5% gain in true‐positives observed with the use of intervention A and colposcopy among women referred for an ASC or LSIL cytology was achieved with only a fractional increase in number of biopsies obtained per patient (0.30) and a modest increase in false‐positive rate
(4%). In the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm among women with ASC or LSIL, the PPV (positive predictive value) of biopsies indicated by ntervention A was 15.0% and the PPV of biopsies indicated by colposcopy was 15.2%. Joint hypothesis testing indicates that intervention A and colposcopy provides benefit compared to colposcopy alone among women with ASC or LSIL.
Conclusion:
Combining intervention A with colposcopy provides a clinically meaningful increase in the detection of CIN 2, 3 in women referred for the evaluation of mildly abnormal cytology results.",spin,"The study looked at whether adding a special test (called intervention A) to a regular check-up for the cervix (called colposcopy) helps find more cases of a serious condition called CIN 2 or 3. The cervix is the lower, narrow part of the uterus that opens into the vagina. CIN 2 and 3 are types of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, which means there are abnormal cells on the cervix that could turn into cancer if not treated.

The study was done in many clinics and involved almost 2,300 women who had a test showing their cervix might have a problem. They were split into two groups: one group got the regular check-up only, and the other group got the regular check-up plus the special test.

The results showed that the group that got the special test along with the regular check-up found more cases of CIN 2 or 3 (this is called a true-positive rate) compared to the group that only had the regular check-up. Specifically, for women who had mildly abnormal test results, adding the special test helped find more cases of CIN 2 or 3.

After looking at the results, they found that adding the special treatment did not help find more cases of the serious condition than just using the regular check-up. The number of times they found the serious condition was about the same in both groups. Also, there were more unnecessary tests done when the special treatment was added.

In the end, the study showed that using the special treatment along with the regular check-up did not make a big difference in finding the serious condition. So, it's not necessary to add the special treatment to the regular check-up for these women."

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of treatment A plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) therapy in comparison with CAF alone, in patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
In this randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial, patients were treated with six cycles of CAF therapy: 28 days/cycle, with doxorubicin (25 mg/m2) and fluorouracil (500 mg/m2) administered on days 1 and 8 and cyclophosphamide (100 mg orally [PO]) administered on day 1 through 14. Primary end point was overall response rate (ORR; partial or complete response). In total, 221 patients were assessable.
Results:
ORR was 42.6% for CAF compared with 53.1% for treatment A + CAF, a 24.6% relative improvement and 10.5% absolute increase (P = .077). There was a trend for prolonged progression‐free survival (PFS; median 241 days for CAF v 366 days for treatment A + CAF; P = .145). In retrospectively defined subgroups, significant improvement in PFS in favor of treatment A was observed in patients who were premenopausal, had no prior therapy, and were stage IV at diagnosis with an intact primary tumor. Except for neutropenia and leukopenia, there was no statistically significant excess of grade 3/4 adverse events compared with CAF. Treatment with treatment A did not affect the plasma concentration of doxorubicin.
Conclusion:
Treatment A + CAF was well tolerated and is suggested to have efficacy in patients who had not received prior therapy.",spin,"The study looked at two ways to treat breast cancer that has spread or come back. The first way is using a treatment called CAF, which includes three drugs: cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil. The second way is adding another treatment, called Treatment A, to the CAF.

The researchers wanted to see if adding Treatment A to CAF made the treatment work better and if it was safe to use. They gave both treatments to 221 patients who had advanced or recurrent breast cancer and watched how they responded.

Here's what they found:

- More patients got better with Treatment A plus CAF (53.1%) than with just CAF (42.6%). This means adding Treatment A seemed to help more people.
- The time before the cancer got worse was a bit longer for those who got Treatment A plus CAF (366 days) compared to just CAF (241 days), but this difference wasn't big enough to be sure it wasn't just by chance.
- The extra treatment didn't cause more serious side effects than CAF alone, except for two types of blood cell counts going down, which is common with these kinds of treatments.
- The new treatment didn't change how much of the doxorubicin drug was in the blood.

In conclusion, the study suggests that adding Treatment A to CAF might help more people with breast cancer that has spread or come"

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of treatment A plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) therapy in comparison with CAF + placebo, in patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
In this randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial, patients were treated with six cycles of CAF therapy: 28 days/cycle, with doxorubicin (25 mg/m2) and fluorouracil (500 mg/m2) administered on days 1 and 8 and cyclophosphamide (100 mg orally [PO]) administered on day 1 through 14. Primary end point was overall response rate (ORR; partial or complete response). In total, 221 patients were assessable.
Results:
A total of 227 patients were recruited, the full analysis set consisted of 221 patients. ORR was 42.6% (95% confidence interval (CI), 33.1 to 52.5) for CAF + placebo compared with 53.1% (95% CI, 43.5 to 62.5) for treatment A + CAF (P = .077). The median progression‐free survival (PFS) was 241 days for CAF + placebo v 366 days for treatment A + CAF; P = .145. Any adverse event occurred more frequently with CAF + treatment A, 95.5% vs. 88.4%, p=0.025. Neutropenia occurred for 91.2% with CAF + treatment A vs 77.7% with CAF + placebo, p=0.005. Treatment with treatment A did not affect the plasma concentration of doxorubicin.
Conclusion:

One group got a treatment called CAF plus a fake treatment (placebo), and the other group got CAF plus a new treatment called Treatment A. The goal was to see if adding Treatment A to CAF made the treatment work better and was safe to use.

Here's what they found:

- The new Treatment A didn't make the cancer shrink or go away more often than the fake treatment. The number of people who had their cancer shrink or disappear was about the same in both groups.

- The new Treatment A didn't help people live longer without their cancer getting worse. The time before the cancer got worse was about the same in both groups.

- More people had side effects when they took the new Treatment A with CAF compared to just taking CAF and the fake treatment. Side effects can be things like feeling sick or having fewer blood cells.

- One specific side effect, called neutropenia (which means having fewer neutrophils, a type of white blood cell), happened more often in the group that took the new Treatment A.

- The new Treatment A didn't change how much of the medicine doxorubicin was in the blood.

In 1996, we initiated the multicenter phase III randomized trial to compare the effect on disease‐free survival (DFS) of experimental treatment A versus comparator B after breast‐conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer. This report presents the clinical results with a median follow‐up of 60 months.
Patients and methods:
Between February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery.
Results:
There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5‐year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis‐free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76). Nevertheless, in the node‐positive subgroup, the 5‐year LRFS was statistically better in the treatment A arm (97% in treatment A v 91% in comparator B; P = .02), corresponding to a risk of locoregional recurrence decreased by 39% (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.93).
Conclusion:
This treatment protocol remains an appealing clinical option for many women with operable breast cancer at a high risk of recurrence. Combination treatments with new drugs for breast cancer are warranted.",spin,"Sure, here's a simplified explanation:

Imagine there was a big study done to see if a new medicine (let's call it Treatment A) works better than another medicine (Treatment B) for people who had surgery for early breast cancer. The study looked at how long these people lived without the cancer coming back, how long they lived without the cancer spreading to other parts of the body, and how long they lived overall.

The study included 716 people and they all started their treatments within 6 weeks after surgery. After following them for about 5 years, the researchers found that both treatments worked about the same in helping people live longer without the cancer coming back, without the cancer spreading, and overall.

However, when they looked closer at the people who had cancer that had spread to their lymph nodes (which is a sign that the cancer might be more likely to come back), they found that Treatment A seemed to work a little better. These people had a lower chance of the cancer coming back to the area where it started.

In conclusion, the study suggests that Treatment A might be a good option for people with early breast cancer who are at high risk of the cancer coming back. The researchers think it's a good idea to keep looking into new treatments for breast cancer.

Remember, this study didn't find a huge difference between the two treatments overall, but it did hint that Treatment A might be better for some people. It's always important"

Imagine there was a study done a long time ago, in the late 1980s, to see if a special treatment (let's call it Treatment A) could help people with a type of breast cancer that grows very fast. The study looked at 281 people who had this fast-growing cancer and didn't have cancer in their lymph nodes. Some of these people got Treatment A, and others didn't get any more treatment.

The researchers checked on everyone after 12 years to see how they were doing. They found that 99 people had their cancer come back, 55 of whom were in the group that didn't get Treatment A, and 44 were in the group that did get Treatment A.

When they looked at the numbers, they found that getting Treatment A didn't make a big difference in whether the cancer came back or not, compared to not getting any more treatment. The chance of the cancer coming back was about the same for both groups. Also, the chance of dying from the cancer was about the same for both groups.

Imagine there was a big study done on a special kind of fast-growing breast cancer at the end of the 1980s.

Specifically, there was a 25% less chance of the cancer coming back and a 20% less chance of dying for those who had treatment A compared to those who didn't.

They also found something interesting: a group of patients with cancer that was growing at a medium speed got even more benefits from treatment A. For these people, the chance of the cancer coming back or causing death was cut down by 70% and 73%, respectively, if they got treatment A.

Treatment A is effective against HER‐2‐positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy of treatment A in HER‐2‐negative and HER‐2‐uncharacterized MBC.
Patients and methods:
Women with MBC were randomly assigned to first‐line therapy with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks plus treatment A or placebo. A preplanned retrospective evaluation of HER‐2 status was performed using fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP); secondary end points were objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), event‐free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS).
Results:
In the intent‐to‐treat population (n = 579), there were no significant differences in TTP, EFS, or OS between treatment arms, although differences in ORR and CBR were noted. In 86 HER‐2‐positive patients (15%), treatment with paclitaxel‐ treatment A resulted in statistically significant improvements in TTP, EFS, ORR, and CBR compared with paclitaxel‐placebo. No differences between treatment groups were observed for any end point in HER‐2‐negative patients. The most common adverse events were alopecia, rash, and diarrhea.

Patients and methods:
Patients were randomly assigned to treatment A or comparator B. Comparison of progression‐free survival (PFS) was the primary objective.
Results:

Overall response rate (ORR) was 32% in both arms, and overall survival (OS) was not different between arms (P = .983). Time to treatment failure (TTF; defined as discontinuation, progressive disease, death as a result of any cause, or the start of a new anticancer therapy) was superior in the treatment A arm (P = .059).

Conclusion:
No difference was observed between treatment A and comparator B arms in PFS, ORR, and OS. TTF was longer in the treatment A arm.

Imagine there are two types of medicine (let's call them Medicine A and Medicine B) that doctors are testing to see which one works better for people with a serious kind of breast cancer that has spread. The study wanted to know if Medicine A could help people live longer without their cancer getting worse, compared to Medicine B.

The researchers took 305 people who had this type of cancer and randomly gave them either Medicine A or Medicine B. They wanted to see how long, on average, people could go without their cancer getting worse (this is called ""progression-free survival"") and how long they lived overall.

After looking at the results, here's what they found:

- The time before the cancer got worse was about the same for both medicines (around 8 months for Medicine A and 8 months for Medicine B).
- The chance of the cancer shrinking or going away was the same for both medicines (about 32% for each).
- The average time before someone had to stop taking the medicine because it wasn't working or because of side effects was about 4 months for both medicines.
- The overall time people lived was about the same for both medicines (around 19 months for Medicine A and 21 months for Medicine B).

The side effects were a bit different:

Many cancer patients continue to smoke postdiagnosis, yet there have been few smoking cessation trials for this population.
Methods:
This double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial randomized 246 cancer patients to 9 weeks of placebo or treatment A, stratifying by pre‐treatment depression symptoms. In addition, all patients received transdermal nicotine and behavioral counseling. Primary outcomes were 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence, biochemically confirmed, at the end of treatment (Week 12), and at 6 months post quit day (Week 27). Additional outcomes included: withdrawal, affect, quality of life, compliance, and side effects.
Results:
There was no main effect of treatment A vs. placebo on abstinence (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.38‐4.81, p =0.64). At week 12, the abstinence rates were 24.2% for placebo and 27.2% for treatment A; at week 27, the abstinence rates were 17.4% for placebo and 18.4% for treatment A. There was no statistically significant difference between placebo and treatment A in average daily smoking to week 12 (mean [SE] 5.2 [0.95] vs. 5.3 [1.0]; p=0.97); and to week 27 (mean [SE] 5.4 [0.88] vs. 6.1 [0.90]; p=0.64).

Imagine you have a friend who has cancer and still smokes. Doctors want to help them stop smoking because smoking can make cancer worse. So, they did a special study to see if a new treatment (let's call it Treatment A) could help these cancer patients stop smoking.

Here's what they did:

**Objective:** They wanted to see if Treatment A could help cancer patients quit smoking after they've been diagnosed with cancer.

**Methods:** They took 246 cancer patients and split them into two groups. One group got the new Treatment A for 9 weeks, and the other group got a pretend treatment (placebo) that doesn't actually do anything. Everyone got patches with medicine to help them stop smoking and some advice on how to quit. They checked how many people stopped smoking at the end of the 9 weeks, again at 12 weeks after they stopped smoking, and then 6 months later.

**Results:** After 12 weeks, about 24 out of 100 people in the placebo group had stopped smoking, and about 27 out of 100 in the Treatment A group had stopped. After 6 months, it was about 17 out of 100 for both groups. The study showed that the new Treatment A didn't help more people stop smoking than the pretend treatment.

41,20087643,A bupropion smoking cessation clinical trial for cancer patients,Cancer Causes Control,"Objective:
Many cancer patients continue to smoke postdiagnosis, yet there have been few smoking cessation trials for this population. Depression, which is prevalent among cancer patients, may be a barrier to cessation.
Methods:
This double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial randomized 246 cancer patients to 9 weeks of placebo or treatment A, stratifying by pre‐treatment depression symptoms. In addition, all patients received transdermal nicotine and behavioral counseling. Primary outcomes were 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence, biochemically confirmed, at the end of treatment (Week 12), and at 6 months post quit day (Week 27). Additional outcomes included: withdrawal, affect, quality of life, compliance, and side effects.
Results:
There was no main effect of treatment A vs. placebo on abstinence (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.38‐4.81, p = 0.64). Patients with depression symptoms reported significantly lower abstinence rates vs. patients without depression symptoms (OR = .14, 95% CI: 0.02‐0.80, p=0.03). Treatment A increased abstinence rates, vs. placebo, more for participants with depression vs. those without depression symptoms. For patients with depression symptoms, treatment A reduced withdrawal symptoms and improved quality of life vs. placebo.
Conclusion:
For patients with depression symptoms, treatment increases abstinence rates, lowers withdrawal, and increases quality of life. However, abstinence rates among patients with depression symptoms were low vs. patients without depression symptoms, who exhibited similar abstinence rates when treated with treatment A or transdermal nicotine and counseling alone.

One group got the special treatment (let's call it Treatment A), and the other group got a pretend treatment (a placebo, which is like a sugar pill that doesn't do anything).

The main goal was to see if more people in the Treatment A group could stop smoking for at least 7 days straight, compared to the placebo group. After 9 weeks, they checked again at 12 weeks and then 6 months later.

The results showed that the special treatment (Treatment A) didn't make a big difference overall in helping people stop smoking compared to the placebo. But here's the interesting part: people who had depression were more likely to keep smoking.

However, for those who were feeling depressed, the special treatment (Treatment A) did seem to help a bit more than the placebo. It made it easier for them to stop smoking, they had fewer withdrawal symptoms (like feeling grumpy or craving a cigarette), and their life felt a little better.

Imagine there are two types of medicine, let's call them Medicine A and Medicine B. Doctors wanted to see which one helps people with a serious kind of kidney cancer live longer. They gave 1006 people with this type of cancer either Medicine A or Medicine B, making sure the groups were as similar as possible. The people knew which medicine they were getting because it wasn't a surprise (not masked).

They watched these people for a long time, about 37 months on average, to see who lived the longest.

The difference in how long they lived was very small and not really important (0.3% at 1 year and 2.7% at 3 years).

Both medicines also caused some serious side effects, but more people taking Medicine A had these side effects than those taking Medicine B.

Even though Medicine A didn't help people live longer, it might still be useful because it can make some people's cancer go away for a while. The key thing is to figure out who will benefit from Medicine A.

Imagine you have a friend who has cancer and feels really tired all the time, even more tired than usual. This tiredness is called ""cancer-related fatigue."" In this study, scientists wanted to see if a special treatment (let's call it Treatment A) could help make this tiredness less severe.

They did a big study with 877 kids who were starting chemotherapy for cancer. Chemotherapy is a treatment that helps fight cancer, but it can also make you feel very tired. Out of these kids, 867 said they felt tired.

The scientists divided these tired kids into two groups. One group got Treatment A, and the other group got something that looked like Treatment A but didn't actually do anything (this is called a placebo). The treatment started on the fifth day of their second round of chemotherapy and ended after the seventh day of their fourth round.

During their treatment, the kids filled out forms to say how tired they felt and if they felt sad or down (which can happen when you're really tired).

After looking at all the forms, the scientists found that Treatment A really helped the kids who felt very tired at the start. These kids felt less tired after using Treatment A. But for kids who weren't as tired to begin with, Treatment A didn't make much of a difference.

Also, the study showed that Treatment A didn't change how sad"

The characteristics of the 260 patients randomized to cytarabine and idarubicine with treatment A or cytarabine and idarubicine alone (control arm) were similar in both arms. 62.5% of patients randomized in the treatment A arm had a complete response to induction vs. 64.6% in the control arm; p=0.72. The three‐year OS rates were not statistically significantly different between treatment A and control arm (25.6 +/‐ 5.1% vs. 31.8 +/‐ 5.6%; p=0.38. Treatment A as an adjunct to cytarabine and idarubicine was not more effective than cytarabine and idarubicine alone in acute myeloid leukemia patients.,no_spin,"Okay, let's break this down into simpler terms. Imagine you have a group of 260 kids who all have a serious illness called acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These kids were split into two groups to try out two different treatments to see which one works better.

One group got a new treatment called ""Treatment A"" along with two other medicines (cytarabine and idarubicine). The other group just got the two other medicines without Treatment A.

After giving these treatments, they looked at how well each treatment worked. They measured this by seeing how many kids got better (had a complete response) and how many kids survived for three years.

Here's what they found:

- About the same number of kids in both groups got better (62.5% in the Treatment A group and 64.6% in the group without Treatment A). The difference wasn't big enough to say one group did better than the other (p=0.72).
- After three years, about 25.6% of kids in the Treatment A group were still alive, compared to about 31.8% in the group without Treatment A. Again, this difference wasn't big enough to say one group did better than the other (p=0.38).

So, based on this study, adding Treatment A to the other two medicines didn't make a big difference in helping kids get better or live longer. It"

Three‐ year OS were similar (25.6 +/‐ 5.1% vs. 31.8 +/‐ 5.6%) in both arms except for patients with myeloblastic features. Significant factors for better survival were the use of treatment A (p = 0.049), female sex (p = 0.05) and single induction cycle (p < 0.001) in multivariate analysis. Female patients performed better than male patients. Better survival obtained among female AML patients needs to be validated within the context of cytogenetic analysis.",spin,"Sure, here's a simplified explanation:

Imagine there's a new medicine called Treatment A that doctors are testing to see if it helps kids with a serious kind of blood cancer called AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia). This test is happening in different hospitals to make sure the results are good.

The doctors are checking two things:
1. Does Treatment A make the kids feel better and stay healthier longer?
2. Is Treatment A safe for the kids?

The kids in the study were pretty much the same in both groups - some got Treatment A along with their regular cancer treatment, and some just got the regular treatment.

The results showed that:
- Treatment A made the side effect of low white blood cell count (leukopenia) less severe and didn't last as long.
- After three years, about the same number of kids in both groups were still alive (around 25-32%).
- But, for kids whose AML looked a certain way under a microscope (those with myeloblastic features), the group that got Treatment A did a bit better.

When the doctors looked closer to see what helped the kids live longer, they found:
- Kids who got Treatment A had a slightly better chance of surviving.
- Girls did better than boys.
- And, kids who only had one round of the regular cancer treatment did even better.

A two‐arm, double‐blind, randomized trial was performed to evaluate the effect of treatment A on acute skin‐related toxicity in patients undergoing breast or chest wall radiotherapy.
Methods and material:
Patients with ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast carcinoma who were undergoing external beam radiotherapy to the breast or chest wall were randomly assigned to apply treatment A or placebo cream daily. The primary study endpoint was the provider assessed maximal grade of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, radiation dermatitis.
Results:
A total of 176 patients were enrolled between September 21, 2007, and December 7, 2007. The provider assessed primary endpoint showed no difference in the mean maximum grade of radiation dermatitis by treatment arm (1.2+/‐0.85 for treatment A vs. 1.3+/‐0.80 for placebo; p = .18). Severe radiation dermatitis concerned 4 (5%) in both arms; p=.97. The worst grade of any type of toxicity were respectively in the placebo and treatment A groups 9% vs. 2% for grade 3 or 4: 24% vs. 30% for grade 2; 61% vs. 40% for grade 1; and 6% vs. 27% for grade 0; p = .04.

Imagine there's a group of people who are getting a special kind of treatment for their breast or chest wall because they have cancer. This treatment involves using a machine called radiotherapy to help fight the cancer. But sometimes, this treatment can make their skin get red, sore, or irritated. This is called radiation dermatitis.

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment A in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer (OC).
Methods:
Patients with platinum‐refractory or ‐resistant primary or secondary) OC were randomized to receive treatment A and PLD at 50 mg/m2 intravenously or PLD alone at 50 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 every 28 days until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression‐free survival (PFS). Other end points were objective response rate and safety. The study was originally planned for 244 patients. The trial was temporarily placed on hold after 125 patients were randomized while the results of another trial were being reviewed and the sponsor decided not to resume enrollment. The interim analysis became the final analysis.
Results:
The median PFS was 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD (n = 65) versus 3.7 months for PLD (n = 60) (hazards ratio, 0.92; P = 0.7243). A preplanned subgroup analysis showed that 75 patients with platinum‐refractory or primary platinum‐resistant OC had a median PFS of 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD versus 2.9 months for PLD (hazards ratio, 0.55; P = 0.0425). Hematologic adverse events were 66% on the treatment A + PLD arm versus 44% on the PLD arm, manageable with dose reductions. Nonhematologic adverse events were similar for both arms. The incidence of palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis was lower on treatment A + PLD (23%, 31%, respectively) versus (39%, 49%, respectively) on PLD.
Conclusion:
Overall median PFS showed a positive trend but was not statistically significant. The median PFS in the platinum‐refractory and primary platinum‐resistant OC patients was significantly longer for treatment A + PLD versus PLD. Treatment A may ameliorate the palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis known to be associated with PLD.

Patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagogastric junction (AEG II and III) were randomly assigned to treatment A followed by surgery or to surgery alone. To detect with 80% power an improvement in median survival from 17 months with surgery alone to 24 months with treatment A, 282 events were required.
Results:
This trial was stopped for poor accrual after 144 patients were randomly assigned (72:72); 52.8% patients had tumors located in the proximal third of the stomach, including AEG type II and III. The International Union against Cancer R0 resection rate was 81.9% after treatment A as compared with 66.7% with surgery alone (P = .036). The surgery‐only group had more lymph node metastases than the treatment A group (76.5% v 61.4%; P = .018).

Conclusion:
This trial showed a significantly increased R0 resection rate but failed to demonstrate a survival benefit. Possible explanations are low statistical power, a high rate of proximal gastric cancer including AEG and/or a better outcome than expected after radical surgery alone due to the high quality of surgery with resections of regional lymph nodes outside the perigastic area (celiac trunc, hepatic ligament, lymph node at a. lienalis; D2).",spin,"Sure, here's a simplified explanation:

Imagine there was a big test to see if a new medicine (let's call it Treatment A) could help people with a certain kind of stomach or esophagus cancer live longer. This test, called a phase III trial, had strict rules about how to prepare for and perform surgery along with the treatment.

Imagine there's a new medicine called Treatment A that doctors wanted to test to see if it helps people with a serious stomach or throat cancer (called adenocarcinoma) live longer. This test was done on people whose cancer was pretty advanced and hard to treat.

The doctors took two groups of people who had this kind of cancer. One group got the new Treatment A first and then had surgery, while the other group just had surgery right away. The main thing they wanted to know was whether getting Treatment A before surgery helped people live longer.

After watching these patients for a while (about 4.4 years on average), they found that the people who got Treatment A before surgery didn't live significantly longer than those who just had surgery. The average time they lived was around 64.6 months for the Treatment A group and 52.5 months for the surgery-only group. The difference wasn't big enough to say for sure that Treatment A was better.

They also looked at how long it took for the cancer to get worse in both groups and found that it didn't make a big difference either.

The good news is that more people in the Treatment A group had their cancer completely removed during surgery (81.9%) compared to those who just had surgery (66.7%). This is important because removing all the cancer can help people live longer"

Although numerous prescription hypnotics are available, few are approved for long‐term use or have demonstrated benefit in this circumstance. Hypnotics may have unwanted side effects and are costly, and cancer survivors often wish to avoid prescription drugs. New options with limited side effects are needed. The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of treatment A for sleep in people with cancer who were undergoing cancer treatment. Participants were randomized to receive treatment A or placebo orally 1 hour before bedtime for 8 weeks. The primary end point was area under the curve (AUC) of the overall Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Secondary outcomes included the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Toxicity was evaluated with both self‐reported numeric analogue scale questions and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0. Questionnaires were completed at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks. A total of 227 patients were randomized into this study between March 19, 2004, and March 9, 2007, with 119 being evaluable for the primary end point. The AUC over the 8 weeks for treatment A was 51.4 (SD = 16), while that for placebo was 49.7 (SD = 15), with a P value of 0.6957. A supplemental, exploratory analysis revealed that several fatigue end points, as measured by the BFI and POMS, were significantly better for those taking treatment A over placebo. Participants also reported less trouble with sleep and less drowsiness on treatment A than placebo. There were no significant differences in toxicities as measured by self‐report or the CTCAE except for mild alkaline phosphatase increases, which were slightly more common in the placebo group. This study failed to provide data to support the hypothesis that treatment A, at bedtime could improve sleep as measured by the PSQI. However, exploratory analyses revealed improvement in some secondary outcomes, such as fatigue. Further research with treatment A exploring physiologic effects in oncology symptom management may be warranted.",spin,"This study looked at how well a new treatment, called treatment A, helps people with cancer sleep better. These people were already getting treatment for their cancer. The researchers gave some of these people treatment A and some got a fake treatment (placebo) to see if there was a difference.

The main thing they were looking at was how well people slept over 8 weeks. They measured this using something called the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The results showed that people who took treatment A didn't sleep any better than those who took the fake treatment, according to the PSQI scores.

However, when they looked at other things, like how tired the people felt (measured by the BFI and POMS), they found that people who took treatment A felt less tired than those who took the fake treatment. They also reported having less trouble sleeping and feeling less sleepy.

There were no serious side effects from the treatment, but some people taking the fake treatment had slightly higher levels of something called alkaline phosphatase, which is a sign of some health issues.

In the end, the study didn't show that treatment A helps people sleep better as measured by the main tool they used. But it did show some positive effects on feeling less tired, which could be important for people with cancer. The researchers think it might be worth studying treatment A more to see how it affects the body and helps with cancer symptoms.

Imagine you have a friend who had cancer and is still feeling tired and having trouble sleeping even after getting better. Doctors wanted to see if a special medicine (let's call it Treatment A) could help them sleep better. They gathered 227 friends who were going through cancer treatment and divided them into two groups. One group got the special medicine before bed for 8 weeks, and the other group got a pretend medicine (a placebo) that doesn't actually do anything.

After 8 weeks, they checked how well everyone was sleeping using a special sleep score. The results showed that the special medicine didn't help the friends sleep any better than the pretend medicine. They also looked at how tired the friends felt and their mood, but again, the special medicine didn't make a big difference compared to the pretend medicine.

No one had bad side effects from the special medicine, and it didn't make anyone feel worse. So, based on this study, the special medicine didn't help the friends who had cancer sleep better. It's important to remember that just because this medicine didn't work, it doesn't mean other treatments won't help. Scientists will keep looking for better ways to help people sleep when they're going through cancer treatment."

High levels of distress and need for self‐care information by patients commencing chemotherapy suggest that current prechemotherapy education is suboptimal. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of a prechemotherapy education intervention (treatment A) to assess impact on patient distress, treatment‐related concerns, and the prevalence and severity of and bother caused by six chemotherapy side‐effects.
Patients and methods:
One hundred and ninety‐two breast, gastrointestinal, and haematologic cancer patients were recruited before the trial closing prematurely (original target 352). Treatment A was administered before first treatment (intervention 1), 48 h after first treatment (intervention 2), and immediately before second treatment (intervention 3). Patient outcomes were measured at baseline (T1: pre‐education) and immediately preceding treatment cycles 1 (T2) and 3 (T3).
Results:
Treatment A did not significantly reduce patient distress. However, a significant decrease in sensory/psychological (P=0.027) and procedural (P=0.03) concerns, as well as prevalence and severity of and bother due to vomiting (all P=0.001), were observed at T3. In addition, subgroup analysis of patients with elevated distress at T1 indicated a significant decrease (P=0.035) at T2 but not at T3 (P=0.055) in treatment A patients.
Conclusion:
Treatment A holds promise to improve patient treatment‐related concerns and some physical/psychological outcomes; however, further research is required on more diverse patient populations to ensure generalisability.",spin,"The study looked at how helpful it is for people about to start chemotherapy to get extra information and support before they begin their treatment. Chemotherapy is a treatment for cancer that can make people feel sick. The researchers wanted to see if giving patients special education and support before they start chemotherapy could help them feel less worried and deal better with the side effects of the treatment.

They gave this special education and support to some patients in three different parts of their treatment: just before they started, 48 hours after the first treatment, and just before their second treatment. They also measured how worried the patients were and how much they were bothered by six common side effects of chemotherapy, like vomiting, before they started the education (T1), right before their first treatment cycle (T2), and right before their third treatment cycle (T3).

The results showed that the special education and support didn't make the patients feel less worried overall. However, it did help them worry less about certain things, like how chemotherapy would feel or how it would be done (sensory/psychological and procedural concerns), and it made them less likely to vomit and be bothered by it. Also, for the patients who were already very worried at the start (T1), getting this extra support helped them feel less worried right before their first treatment (T2), but this effect wasn't as strong by the time of their third treatment (T3).
