Randomized trial of fenretinide to prevent second breast malignancy in women with early breast cancer",J Natl Cancer Inst,"Background:
Treatment A has been shown to inhibit breast carcinogenesis in preclinical studies. We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.
Methods:
We randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30‐70 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66‐1.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64‐1.09; P = .177) between the two arms. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs (38 in the treatment A arm versus 40 in the control arm), incidence of distant metastasis (HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.79‐1.22; P = .858), and all‐cause mortality (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.92‐1.48; P = .215).
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than no treatment in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.",no_spin,"Sure, here's a simplified explanation:

Imagine there's a medicine called Treatment A that scientists thought might stop new breast cancers from growing in women who already had breast cancer. To see if this medicine really works, they did a big study with 2972 women who had either very early breast cancer or a condition that could lead to it.

Half of these women took Treatment A every day for 5 years, while the other half didn't take anything extra. The scientists made sure that who got the treatment and who didn't was decided randomly, like picking names out of a hat.

All the women were checked regularly for new breast cancers or other health problems for 7 years after they were assigned to their groups. The scientists wanted to see if the women who took Treatment A were less likely to get a new breast cancer or other types of cancer compared to those who didn't take it.

After looking at all the results, the scientists found that the number of women who got new breast cancers or other cancers was about the same in both groups. This means that taking Treatment A didn't make a difference in preventing new breast cancers or other cancers compared to not taking it.

So, the conclusion is that Treatment A didn't work better than not taking anything extra to prevent new breast cancers in women who already had breast cancer."

The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. Other end points considered post hoc were the same outcomes stratified by menopausal status, incidence of distant metastases, overall mortality, and tumors in other organs. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (P =.642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (P =.177) between the two arms. However, an interaction was detected between treatment A and menopausal status in both outcomes (P for interaction in both outcomes =.045), with a possible beneficial effect in premenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66, and 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.41‐1.07; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 0.65, and 95% CI = 0.46‐0. 92) and an opposite effect in postmenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.32, and 95% CI = 0.82‐2.15; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.19, and 95% CI = 0.75‐1. 89). There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs, incidence of distant metastasis, and all‐cause mortality.

Treatment A of women with breast cancer for 5 years appears to have no statistically significant effect on the incidence of second breast malignancies overall, although a possible benefit was detected in premenopausal women.

Imagine there's a medicine called Treatment A that scientists think might stop new breast cancers from growing in women who already had breast cancer. They wanted to see if this medicine really works, so they did an experiment with 2972 women who had either early stage breast cancer or a condition that could lead to it.

These women were split into two groups: one group took Treatment A every day for 5 years, and the other group didn't take anything. The scientists watched both groups for 7 years to see if any of them got a new breast cancer in the breast that was treated or the other breast.

After watching for a long time, they found that overall, the medicine didn't seem to make a big difference in whether or not the women got new breast cancers. But here's the interesting part: when they looked closer, they noticed something different depending on whether the women were still having periods (premenopausal) or not having periods anymore (postmenopausal).

For premenopausal women (those still having periods), the medicine seemed to help a little bit and made it less likely for them to get a new breast cancer. But for postmenopausal women (those not having periods), the medicine didn't seem to help and might have even made it a tiny bit more likely to get a new breast cancer.

They also checked if the medicine affected other cancers or how long the"

It is uncertain whether treatment A provides additional benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. This trial was initiated to explore this question.
Patients and methods:
Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization. The two end points of interest for this study were time to treatment failure (TTF) and survival time.
Results:
Median survival was 30.0 months for chemotherapy alone and 29.3 months treatment A and chemotherapy, p=0.834. Time to treatment failure (TTF) was 13.4 months for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with 10.3 month for chemotherapy alone patients (P = .087).

Imagine there are two types of medicine for people with cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic breast cancer). One is just chemotherapy, and the other is chemotherapy plus a new treatment called ""Treatment A."" Doctors wanted to see if adding Treatment A to chemotherapy would help patients live longer or feel better.

From January 1988 to December 1992, they gave 231 patients either just chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus Treatment A. After the first treatment, some patients got better, and then they had a choice to keep getting more treatment or not. The doctors were interested in two things: how long patients lived and how long it took for the cancer to start growing again.

The results showed that people who got chemotherapy alone lived about the same amount of time as those who got chemotherapy plus Treatment A (around 30 months each). The time before the cancer started growing again was a bit longer for those who got Treatment A with chemotherapy (13.4 months) compared to just chemotherapy (10.3 months), but this difference wasn't big enough to be sure it wasn't just by chance (P = .087).

The number of people who got better (had a complete or partial response) was almost the same in both groups (about 70% in each group). The new Treatment A didn't make patients feel worse than just chemotherapy, and there were only a few serious side effects, including"

Patients and methods:
Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with estrogen receptor (ER)‐positive or ER‐unknown metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization.
Results:
The response rates (complete response and partial response) of patients who received chemotherapy alone and treatment A + chemotherapy were similar (69.2% v 68.9%, respectively; P =.99). Time to treatment failure (TTF) was slightly longer for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone patients (13.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.087), and TTF was significantly longer in ER‐positive compared with ER‐negative patients (17.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.048). However, ER status had no effect on overall survival (30.0 months for chemotherapy alone v 29.3 months for treatment A + chemotherapy).
Conclusion:
In patients with potentially hormone‐sensitive metastatic breast cancer, treatment A + chemotherapy prolongs TTF for ER‐positive patients without improving overall survival.",spin,"Sure, here's a simplified explanation:

Imagine there are two groups of people with a serious kind of breast cancer that has spread. One group gets a special treatment (let's call it Treatment A) along with regular chemotherapy, while the other group just gets chemotherapy. The main question was whether adding Treatment A would make a big difference in helping these people.

**What they found:**

1. **Response Rates:** The number of people who got better (either fully or partly) was about the same in both groups. So, Treatment A didn't seem to make more people get better than just chemotherapy alone.

2. **Time Until Cancer Comes Back:** People who got Treatment A along with chemotherapy took a bit longer for their cancer to come back or get worse compared to those who just had chemotherapy. This time was about 3 months longer for the Treatment A group.

3. **Overall Survival:** Sadly, the study found that whether people lived longer or not didn't change much between the two groups. Both groups had about the same average time of living after starting treatment, around 30 months.

**Conclusion:**

Adding Treatment A to chemotherapy made the cancer take longer to come back for some people, especially those whose cancer cells were sensitive to hormones. However, it didn't help them live longer overall. So, while it might help for a while, it doesn't change the total time they have."
27,11261827,Phase III randomized trial of toremifene vs tamoxifen in hormonodependant advanced breast cancer,Breast Cancer Res Treat,"Purpose:
Efficacy and safety of treatment A was compared with comparator B in a group of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, without previous systemic therapy for advanced breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
The study was a prospective double‐blind randomized trial. All treated patients presented with positive estrogen receptors. Main end points were response rates, toxicity profile analysis, time to progression and survival. WHO and ECOG criteria were employed for response evaluation while toxicity was assessed according to WHO guidelines. Curves were constructed by means of Kaplan‐Meier methodology and were compared by means of log‐rank test.
Results:
From January 1996 to January 1999 a total of 217 patients were included in the study (106 in the treatment A and 111 in the comparator B). Both groups of patients were homogeneous regarding the main prognostic factors. A response rate of 64% (68/106) was observed in the treatment A group as compared with a 52% (58/111) in the comparator B group. Median times to progression and overall survival were not significantly different. A lower incidence of undesirable effects was appreciated in the treatment A arm.

Imagine there are two special treatments, let's call them Treatment A and Treatment B. Scientists wanted to see which one is better for women who have breast cancer that has spread and who have already gone through menopause. These women hadn't tried any other big treatments for their advanced breast cancer before.

The scientists did a careful study where they randomly picked some women to try Treatment A and some to try Treatment B. They made sure the groups were similar in many ways that could affect the results.

They looked at how well each treatment worked (how many women got better), how safe the treatments were (how many bad side effects happened), how long it took for the cancer to get worse, and how long the women lived.

The results showed that more women got better with Treatment A (64 out of 106) than with Treatment B (58 out of 111). Also, fewer women had bad side effects with Treatment A. The time it took for the cancer to get worse and how long the women lived were about the same for both treatments.

The scientists concluded that Treatment A seems to be a good choice because it helps more women get better and causes fewer side effects. They think it should be considered as a first-choice treatment for women with this type of breast cancer and also as a treatment used after surgery.

In simple terms, Treatment A seems to be a better option for women with advanced breast"

They wanted to see how well each medicine worked, if it had bad side effects, how long it took for the cancer to get worse, and how long the women lived.

They found that the number of women whose cancer got better was about the same for both medicines, so Medicine A wasn't better than Medicine B in making the cancer shrink. The time it took for the cancer to get worse and how long the women lived were also about the same for both groups.

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy with or without treatment A primarily on disease‐free survival (DFS) and secondarily on overall survival (OS) in patients with high‐risk operable breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
From June 1997 until November 2000, 604 patients with T1‐3N1M0 or T3N0M0 tumors were randomized to three cycles of epirubicin 110 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of treatment A followed by three cycles of 'intensified' CMF (cyclophosphamide 840 mg/m2, methotrexate 47 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 840 mg/m2) (group A), or to four cycles of epirubicin followed by four cycles of CMF, as in group A (group B). All cycles were given every 2 weeks with granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor support.
Results:
A total of 595 patients were eligible. Median follow‐up was 61.7 months for group A and 62 months for group B. DFS and OS did not differ significantly between treatment groups (log‐rank P = 0.55 and P = 0.38, respectively). The 3‐year DFS was 80% in group A and 77% in group B. Survival rates were 93% and 90%, respectively. Comparison of quality of life outcomes between the two groups showed no statistically significant differences. Both regimens were well tolerated and severe acute side‐effects were infrequent. No cases of severe cardiotoxicity or acute leukemia were recorded.
Conclusion:
Treatment A with a dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy was not more effective than a dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy alone in patients with high‐risk operable breast cancer.",no_spin,"Sure, here's a simplified explanation:

Imagine you have a group of people who were very sick with a certain type of breast cancer that could be removed by surgery. Doctors wanted to see if adding a special medicine (let's call it Treatment A) to their regular chemotherapy would help them live longer without the cancer coming back or help them live longer overall.

So, they divided these sick people into two groups. One group got the regular chemotherapy first, then Treatment A, and then a stronger version of another treatment (let's call it 'intensified' CMF). The other group just got the regular chemotherapy and the 'intensified' CMF, without Treatment A.

After following these people for a while, the doctors found that adding Treatment A didn't make a big difference in how long they lived without the cancer coming back or in their overall survival. Both groups had about the same chance of living 3 years without the cancer returning, and their chances of surviving were also about the same.

The doctors also checked how the treatments made the patients feel. They found that both groups felt about the same and could handle the treatments well, with very few serious side effects.

In the end, the doctors concluded that adding Treatment A to the regular chemotherapy didn't help the patients live longer or better. It was just as good to stick with the regular chemotherapy and the 'intensified' CMF."

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy with or without treatment A primarily on disease‐free survival (DFS) and secondarily on overall survival (OS) in patients with high‐risk operable breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
From June 1997 until November 2000, 604 patients with T1‐3N1M0 or T3N0M0 tumors were randomized to three cycles of epirubicin 110 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of treatment A followed by three cycles of 'intensified' CMF (cyclophosphamide 840 mg/m2, methotrexate 47 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 840 mg/m2) (group A), or to four cycles of epirubicin followed by four cycles of CMF, as in group A (group B). All cycles were given every 2 weeks with granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor support.
Results:
A total of 595 patients were eligible. Median follow‐up was 61.7 months for group A and 62 months for group B. The 3‐year DFS was 80% in group A and 77% in group B. Survival rates were 93% and 90%, respectively. The effect of treatment on the hazard of death was different according to hormonal receptor status. More specifically, in patients with negative receptor status the hazard of death was significantly higher for group B (hazard ratio 2.42). Both regimens were well tolerated and severe acute side‐effects were infrequent. No cases of severe cardiotoxicity or acute leukemia were recorded.
Conclusion:
The present study failed to demonstrate a significant difference in DFS or OS between the two treatment groups. However, our study has shown clearly that treatment A can be safely incorporated to dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy.",spin,"Sure, here's a simplified explanation:

Imagine there's a group of people with a serious type of breast cancer that's hard to treat. Doctors wanted to see if adding a special medicine (let's call it ""Treatment A"") to their regular chemotherapy could help them live longer without the cancer coming back. This is called ""disease-free survival"" (DFS). They also wanted to see if it helped them live longer overall, which is called ""overall survival"" (OS).

From 1997 to 2000, doctors gave chemotherapy to 604 people with this type of cancer. Some got three cycles of one medicine (epirubicin) followed by three cycles of Treatment A and then three cycles of another combination of medicines (CMF), while others got four cycles of epirubicin followed by four cycles of CMF without Treatment A. They gave the medicines every two weeks and used a special medicine to help their bodies make more white blood cells, which are important for fighting infections.

After following these patients for a long time, they found that 80% of the people in the group with Treatment A were cancer-free after three years, and 77% of the people in the group without Treatment A were cancer-free. Both groups had a high chance of being alive after three years, with 93% in the Treatment A group and 90% in the group without Treatment A.

To determine whether treatment A, improves survival in patients with brain metastases when used as an adjunct to whole‐brain radiation therapy (WBRT).
Patients and methods:
Patients with brain metastases from solid tumors and a Karnofsky performance score of > or = 70 were randomly assigned to receive WBRT with supplemental oxygen and either treatment A (treatment A arm) or no treatment (control arm). The primary end point was survival.
Results:
The study consisted of 515 eligible patients (treatment A arm, n = 265; control arm, n = 250). The median survival time (MST) was 5.4 months for the treatment A arm versus 4.4 months for the control arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87; P = .16). For the subgroup of patients with non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or breast cancer, the MST was 6.0 and 4.4 months, respectively (HR = 0.82; P = .07). Cox multiple regression analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of death for the treatment A arm in both primary populations. Further analysis indicated that the benefit may be restricted to the subgroup of patients with breast cancer. Response rates (radiographic complete response plus partial response) improved by 7% (P = .10) and 13% (P = .01) for all patients and for NSCLC and breast cancer patients in the treatment A arm, respectively. The most common severe adverse event in patients treated with treatment A was hypoxemia, which was reversible and effectively managed with supplemental oxygen in most patients.
Conclusion:
The addition of treatment A to WBRT may improve response rates and survival in patients with brain metastases, particularly metastases from breast cancer. A confirmatory trial for breast cancer patients has been initiated.",spin,"Sure, here's a simplified explanation:

Imagine there are sick people with cancer that has spread to their brain. Doctors want to know if adding a special treatment (let's call it Treatment A) to their regular brain radiation therapy helps them live longer.

So, they took 515 sick people and split them into two groups. One group got the regular brain radiation therapy plus Treatment A (we'll call this the Treatment A group), and the other group just got the regular brain radiation therapy (the Control group).

After watching how long these people lived, they found that, on average, the people in the Treatment A group lived about 5.4 months, while those in the Control group lived about 4.4 months. This difference wasn't huge, but it was there.

They also looked closer at people who had lung cancer or breast cancer. Those with breast cancer in the Treatment A group lived a bit longer, on average, than those in the Control group.

The special Treatment A also seemed to help more people's cancer shrink or get better, especially in those with lung cancer and breast cancer.

One downside was that some people in the Treatment A group had trouble breathing because of the treatment, but doctors were able to help them breathe better by giving them extra oxygen.

In the end, doctors think that adding Treatment A to the regular brain radiation therapy might help people with brain cancer live longer, especially those with breast cancer"

Conclusion:

Imagine there are two groups of sick people with cancer that has spread to their brains. One group gets a special treatment (let's call it Treatment A) along with their regular brain radiation therapy. The other group just gets the regular brain radiation therapy without the special treatment.

The doctors wanted to see if the special treatment (Treatment A) would help these people live longer. They also looked to see if it would make their cancer shrink or if it would stop the cancer from getting worse in their brains.

After watching these patients for a while, they found that:

- The people who got the special treatment didn't live any longer than those who didn't.
- The cancer didn't shrink more in the group that got the special treatment.
- The cancer didn't get worse more slowly in the brains of the people who got the special treatment compared to those who didn't.

Also, the special treatment made some people have trouble breathing because they weren't getting enough oxygen.

So, the conclusion is that the special treatment didn't help these sick people live longer or make their cancer better. It also caused some bad side effects.

In short, the special treatment didn't work as hoped, and it had some downsides."

To compare treatment A and comparator B in node‐positive, operable breast cancer patients.
Methods and materials:
This was a randomized, multicenter, phase III trial enrolling 638 eligible women with prior breast surgery and positive axillary dissection. Patients in Arm A received treatment A, with concomitant radiotherapy (50 Gy +/‐ 10‐20‐Gy boost). Patients in Arm B received comparator B, with subsequent radiotherapy.
Results:
Median treatment durations were 64 and 126 days (Arms A and B, respectively), with no significant difference in overall or disease‐free survival. Five‐year locoregional relapse‐free survival favored patients with conservative surgery (two thirds of the population), with less local and / or regional recurrence in Arm A than in Arm B (3% vs. 9%; p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis in this subgroup showed a 2.8‐fold increased risk of locoregional recurrence with comparator B, independent of other prognostic factors (p = 0.027). Febrile neutropenia and Grade 3‐4 leukopenia were significantly more frequent in Arm A. Subclinical left ventricular ejection fraction events at 1 year were more frequent with treatment A (p = 0.02).

The study included 638 women who had already had some surgery on their breast and whose tests showed cancer in the lymph nodes.

**Results:**

- **Treatment Time:** The women in Treatment A finished their treatment about 62 days earlier on average than those in Treatment B.
- **Survival:** There was no big difference in how long the women lived or how long they stayed cancer-free between the two groups.
- **Locoregional Recurrence:** This means the cancer coming back in the same area it was treated. Women who had a smaller surgery (conservative surgery, which is what two out of three women in the study had) were less likely to have the cancer come back in the treated area if they got Treatment A compared to Treatment B. This difference was statistically significant.

Patients and methods:
Between March 1991 and June 1999, 1863 women with stages I‐IIIA operable breast cancer who had undergone surgery and completed six cycles of adjuvant combination chemotherapy with either CMF, CAF, CEF, FAC or FEC were randomized to receive either treatment A for 3 years or no further treatment. Irrespective of menstrual status and hormone receptor content of the primary tumor, patients were stratified by institute, chemotherapy scheme and age (above 50 years or younger). The main end‐point was to detect a 5% increase in the 5 year survival (from 80% to 85%) in favor of treatment A. Secondary end‐ points were relapse free survival (RFS), local control, incidence of second primary breast cancer.
Results:
After exclusion of all patients from three sites because of inadequate documentation, a total of 1724 patients (93%) were analyzed (Treatment A 861 and Control 863). At a median follow‐up of 6.5 years, 396 deaths (23%) and 602 RFS events (35%) (relapse and/or death) have been observed.

To assess whether the use of intervention A as an adjunct to colposcopy increases the detection of biopsy confirmed CIN 2, 3 (high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia).
Methods:
This is a multicenter two‐arm randomized trial comparing colposcopy alone with colposcopy plus intervention A. Patients were recruited from 13 colposcopy clinics in a variety of practice settings. 2299 women referred for the evaluation of an abnormal cervical cytology were randomized with stratification by cytology; subsequently 113 women were excluded for a variety of reasons. The main study outcomes were differences in true‐positive rates (CIN 2, 3 and cancer identified) and false‐positive rates between the study arms.
Results:
The true‐positive (TP) rates were 14.4% vs. 11.4% (p=0.035, one‐sided) for the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm compared to colposcopy‐only arm, respectively, in women with either an atypical squamous cell (ASC) or low‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) cytology result. TP rates were similar between the two arms among women referred for the evaluation of HSIL (high‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). The 26.5% gain in true‐positives observed with the use of intervention A and colposcopy among women referred for an ASC or LSIL cytology was achieved with only a fractional increase in number of biopsies obtained per patient (0.30) and a modest increase in false‐positive rate
(4%). In the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm among women with ASC or LSIL, the PPV (positive predictive value) of biopsies indicated by ntervention A was 15.0% and the PPV of biopsies indicated by colposcopy was 15.2%. Joint hypothesis testing indicates that intervention A and colposcopy provides benefit compared to colposcopy alone among women with ASC or LSIL.

Imagine you're playing a game where you're trying to find hidden treasures (which represent pre-cancerous changes in the cervix called CIN 2, 3). The game has two teams: one team uses a map (colposcopy) alone, and the other team uses the map plus a special tool (intervention A) to help them find these treasures.

The game was played in many different places (13 clinics) with lots of players (2299 women) who were looking for these hidden treasures because their initial clue (cervical cytology test) suggested there might be something unusual.

After playing, the team that used the map and the special tool found more treasures (true-positives) than the team that only used the map.

The game was played with many players (women) from different places who were suspected of having these hidden treasures based on a test result. Some players couldn't play for various reasons, so they were left out.

After playing the game, the results showed that using the special helper didn't help find more treasures than just using the tool. Both teams found treasures in about the same number of players, and there were also some players who didn't find any treasures at all, whether they used the helper or not.

In the end, the conclusion was that the special helper didn't make a difference in finding these hidden treasures. So, just using the special tool was enough.

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of treatment A plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) therapy in comparison with CAF alone, in patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
In this randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial, patients were treated with six cycles of CAF therapy: 28 days/cycle, with doxorubicin (25 mg/m2) and fluorouracil (500 mg/m2) administered on days 1 and 8 and cyclophosphamide (100 mg orally [PO]) administered on day 1 through 14. Primary end point was overall response rate (ORR; partial or complete response). In total, 221 patients were assessable.
Results:

The results showed that the group that got ""Treatment A"" plus the three drugs had a better response to the treatment (53.1% of them saw their cancer shrink or disappear) compared to the group that just got the three drugs (42.6% saw their cancer shrink or disappear). This means that adding ""Treatment A"" helped a bit more, but the difference wasn't big enough to be completely sure it wasn't just by chance (the P value was .077, which is close to .05, a common threshold for statistical significance).

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of treatment A plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) therapy in comparison with CAF + placebo, in patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
In this randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial, patients were treated with six cycles of CAF therapy: 28 days/cycle, with doxorubicin (25 mg/m2) and fluorouracil (500 mg/m2) administered on days 1 and 8 and cyclophosphamide (100 mg orally [PO]) administered on day 1 through 14. Primary end point was overall response rate (ORR; partial or complete response). In total, 221 patients were assessable.
Results:
A total of 227 patients were recruited, the full analysis set consisted of 221 patients. ORR was 42.6% (95% confidence interval (CI), 33.1 to 52.5) for CAF + placebo compared with 53.1% (95% CI, 43.5 to 62.5) for treatment A + CAF (P = .077). The median progression‐free survival (PFS) was 241 days for CAF + placebo v 366 days for treatment A + CAF; P = .145. Any adverse event occurred more frequently with CAF + treatment A, 95.5% vs. 88.4%, p=0.025. Neutropenia occurred for 91.2% with CAF + treatment A vs 77.7% with CAF + placebo, p=0.005.

Imagine there are two groups of people with a serious kind of breast cancer that has come back or spread. One group gets a special treatment called ""CAF"" plus a fake medicine (placebo), and the other group gets ""CAF"" plus a real medicine called ""Treatment A.""

The goal was to see if adding ""Treatment A"" to the ""CAF"" treatment would help patients live longer without the cancer getting worse and if it would be safe for them.

Here's what they found out:

- The number of people who got better (even if just a little) was slightly higher in the group with ""CAF"" plus ""Treatment A,"" but the difference wasn't big enough to be sure it wasn't just by chance.
- The time before the cancer got worse or spread again was a bit longer for the group with ""CAF"" plus ""Treatment A,"" but again, the difference wasn't big enough to be completely sure it wasn't just by chance.
- More people in the group with ""CAF"" plus ""Treatment A"" had side effects, like low blood cell counts (neutropenia), and more overall side effects compared to the group with just ""CAF"" and the fake medicine.
- The real medicine ""Treatment A"" didn't change how much of the other medicine (doxorubicin) was in the blood.

In 1996, we initiated the multicenter phase III randomized trial to compare the effect on disease‐free survival (DFS) of experimental treatment A versus comparator B after breast‐conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer. This report presents the clinical results with a median follow‐up of 60 months.
Patients and methods:
Between February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery.
Results:
There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5‐year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis‐free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76). Nevertheless, in the node‐positive subgroup, the 5‐year LRFS was statistically better in the treatment A arm (97% in treatment A v 91% in comparator B; P = .02), corresponding to a risk of locoregional recurrence decreased by 39% (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.93).
Conclusion:
This treatment protocol remains an appealing clinical option for many women with operable breast cancer at a high risk of recurrence. Combination treatments with new drugs for breast cancer are warranted.",spin,"Sure, here's a simplified explanation:

Imagine there was a big study done with 716 women who had early breast cancer and had surgery to remove it. The study wanted to see if giving them two different treatments after surgery would help them live longer without the cancer coming back.

One group of women got Treatment A, and the other group got Treatment B. The study watched these women for about 5 years to see how they did.

The results showed that both groups of women did pretty well. About 80% of women in both groups didn't have the cancer come back during those 5 years. The same was true for not having the cancer spread to other parts of the body, or for overall survival.

However, when they looked closer at the women who had cancer that had spread to their lymph nodes (which means the cancer was a bit more serious), they found that the women who got Treatment A did even better. Almost all of them (97%) didn't have the cancer come back in their breast area, compared to 91% of those who got Treatment B. This means Treatment A helped reduce the chance of the cancer coming back in the breast area by almost 40%.

So, the conclusion is that Treatment A is a good option for women who have had breast cancer surgery and are at high risk of the cancer coming back. Scientists think it's a good idea to keep looking for new treatments to combine with what we already have"

Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than comparator B for patients with advanced breast cancer.",no_spin,"Sure, here's a simplified explanation:

Imagine there are two types of medicine, let's call them Medicine A and Medicine B. Doctors wanted to see which one works better for people with a serious kind of breast cancer that has spread. They gave Medicine A to some patients and Medicine B to others, and they did this randomly so that neither group had an advantage.

The main thing they were looking at was how long patients could go without their cancer getting worse (this is called ""progression-free survival""). They also checked how well the medicines worked in general, how long it took for the medicine to stop working, and how long the patients lived after starting the treatment.

After looking at all the results, they found that:

- The time before the cancer got worse was about the same for both medicines.
- The medicines worked about equally well in helping the cancer shrink.
- The time before the medicine stopped working was very close between the two.
- The patients lived about the same amount of time with both medicines.

However, there were some side effects:

- More people taking Medicine A had very low white blood cell counts (which can make it harder for the body to fight infections) and needed more blood transfusions.
- People taking Medicine A were less likely to have severe diarrhea, mouth sores, and hand-and-foot skin problems compared to those taking Medicine B.
- More people stopped taking Medicine"

Many cancer patients continue to smoke postdiagnosis, yet there have been few smoking cessation trials for this population.
Methods:
This double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial randomized 246 cancer patients to 9 weeks of placebo or treatment A, stratifying by pre‐treatment depression symptoms. In addition, all patients received transdermal nicotine and behavioral counseling. Primary outcomes were 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence, biochemically confirmed, at the end of treatment (Week 12), and at 6 months post quit day (Week 27). Additional outcomes included: withdrawal, affect, quality of life, compliance, and side effects.
Results:
There was no main effect of treatment A vs. placebo on abstinence (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.38‐4.81, p =0.64). At week 12, the abstinence rates were 24.2% for placebo and 27.2% for treatment A; at week 27, the abstinence rates were 17.4% for placebo and 18.4% for treatment A. There was no statistically significant difference between placebo and treatment A in average daily smoking to week 12 (mean [SE] 5.2 [0.95] vs. 5.3 [1.0]; p=0.97); and to week 27 (mean [SE] 5.4 [0.88] vs. 6.1 [0.90]; p=0.64). There were no statistically significant difference between placebo and treatment A on changes in withdrawals (p=0.39); negative (p=0.41) and positive affect (p=0.77), and physical (p=0.31) and mental (p=0.42) quality of life.

Imagine you have a friend who has cancer and still smokes. Doctors wanted to see if a special medicine (let's call it Treatment A) could help them stop smoking. They did an experiment with 246 cancer patients, giving half of them the special medicine and the other half a pretend medicine (placebo) to see if the real medicine worked better.

The patients also got patches with nicotine to help them not crave cigarettes and some advice on how to stop smoking. The main goal was to see if, after 9 weeks of using the medicine or the pretend medicine, and then 6 months later, more people in the Treatment A group had stopped smoking compared to those who took the placebo.

After checking, they found that the special medicine (Treatment A) didn't help more people stop smoking than the pretend medicine. At 12 weeks, about 24% of the people who took the placebo and 27% who took Treatment A had stopped smoking. Six months later, it was about 17% for both groups.

They also looked at how hard it was for people to stop smoking, how they felt emotionally, their overall happiness, whether they followed the treatment plan, and if there were any bad side effects. The results showed that the special medicine didn't make a big difference in any of these areas compared to the placebo.

Many cancer patients continue to smoke postdiagnosis, yet there have been few smoking cessation trials for this population. Depression, which is prevalent among cancer patients, may be a barrier to cessation.
Methods:
This double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial randomized 246 cancer patients to 9 weeks of placebo or treatment A, stratifying by pre‐treatment depression symptoms. In addition, all patients received transdermal nicotine and behavioral counseling. Primary outcomes were 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence, biochemically confirmed, at the end of treatment (Week 12), and at 6 months post quit day (Week 27). Additional outcomes included: withdrawal, affect, quality of life, compliance, and side effects.
Results:
There was no main effect of treatment A vs. placebo on abstinence (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.38‐4.81, p = 0.64). Patients with depression symptoms reported significantly lower abstinence rates vs. patients without depression symptoms (OR = .14, 95% CI: 0.02‐0.80, p=0.03). Treatment A increased abstinence rates, vs. placebo, more for participants with depression vs. those without depression symptoms. For patients with depression symptoms, treatment A reduced withdrawal symptoms and improved quality of life vs. placebo.
Conclusion:
For patients with depression symptoms, treatment increases abstinence rates, lowers withdrawal, and increases quality of life. However, abstinence rates among patients with depression symptoms were low vs. patients without depression symptoms, who exhibited similar abstinence rates when treated with treatment A or transdermal nicotine and counseling alone. These results can guide future smoking cessation intervention studies with cancer patients.",spin,"Sure, here's a simplified explanation:

Imagine you have a friend who has cancer and still smokes. Doctors know that smoking is bad for anyone, but especially for people with cancer. They want to help these friends stop smoking, but it's been hard to find a good way to do this.

In this study, scientists tried to help cancer patients quit smoking by giving them a special treatment (let's call it Treatment A) for 9 weeks. Some patients got this treatment, and others got a pretend treatment (a placebo) to see if the real treatment worked better.

Everyone in the study also got patches with medicine to help them stop smoking and some advice on how to quit. The scientists wanted to see if Treatment A made more people stop smoking than just the patches and advice.

Here's what they found:

1. **Treatment A didn't make more people stop smoking overall** compared to the pretend treatment.
2. **People with depression** were less likely to stop smoking than those without depression.
3. **For people with depression**, Treatment A did help more of them stop smoking than the pretend treatment. It also made them feel better and have fewer bad feelings from quitting.

In the end, the study showed that it's harder for people with depression to stop smoking, but Treatment A can help them more than just the patches and advice. However, even with Treatment A, people with depression still had a harder time"

The real treatment started on the fifth day of their second round of chemotherapy and ended after the seventh day of their fourth round.

The scientists asked all the patients how tired they felt during their treatment, and also checked if they felt depressed. They found that Treatment A really helped the patients who felt very tired at the beginning (we call this ""severe fatigue""). These patients felt less tired after using Treatment A. However, the treatment didn't help much for patients who were only a little or moderately tired at the start.

In the end, the scientists concluded that Treatment A is a good option for helping very tired cancer patients, but it doesn't work as well for those who are only a little tired."

Imagine there's a new medicine called Treatment A that doctors wanted to test to see if it helps kids with a serious blood disease called acute myeloid leukemia (AML) get better when they're first trying to treat it. This test was done with 260 kids who were split into two groups. One group got the new Treatment A along with two other medicines (cytarabine and idarubicine), and the other group just got the two other medicines without Treatment A.

The doctors were checking two main things: how well the kids' bodies responded to the treatment and how long they lived after starting the treatment.

When they looked at how well the treatment worked, they found that about the same number of kids in both groups got better. And when they looked at how long the kids lived, they found that the kids who got Treatment A didn't live any longer than those who didn't get it.

So, the doctors concluded that adding Treatment A to the other medicines didn't help the kids with AML live longer or get better compared to just using the other two medicines."

Imagine there's a new medicine called Treatment A that doctors want to test to see if it helps kids with a serious blood disease called AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia). They're doing a big study with many hospitals to see if this new treatment makes kids feel better and keeps them safe.

In this study, they're comparing two groups of kids who have AML. One group gets the new Treatment A along with their regular treatment, and the other group just gets the regular treatment. The kids in both groups are pretty much the same in terms of who they are.

The results showed that the kids who got Treatment A had fewer and shorter times when their white blood cell counts were low (this is called leukopenia). After three years, about the same number of kids in both groups were still alive (around 25-32%). However, some kids with certain features of AML did better with Treatment A.

When the doctors looked closely at what helped kids live longer, they found that getting Treatment A was a bit helpful (p = 0.049 means it's a little bit significant), being a girl was helpful (p = 0.05), and having just one treatment cycle instead of many was very helpful (p < 0.001, which means it's a strong factor).

A two‐arm, double‐blind, randomized trial was performed to evaluate the effect of treatment A on acute skin‐related toxicity in patients undergoing breast or chest wall radiotherapy.
Methods and material:
Patients with ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast carcinoma who were undergoing external beam radiotherapy to the breast or chest wall were randomly assigned to apply treatment A or placebo cream daily. The primary study endpoint was the provider assessed maximal grade of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, radiation dermatitis.
Results:
A total of 176 patients were enrolled between September 21, 2007, and December 7, 2007. The provider assessed primary endpoint showed no difference in the mean maximum grade of radiation dermatitis by treatment arm (1.2+/‐0.85 for treatment A vs. 1.3+/‐0.80 for placebo; p = .18).

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment A in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer (OC).
Methods:
Patients with platinum‐refractory or ‐resistant primary or secondary) OC were randomized to receive treatment A and PLD at 50 mg/m2 intravenously or PLD alone at 50 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 every 28 days until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression‐free survival (PFS). Other end points were objective response rate and safety. The study was originally planned for 244 patients. The trial was temporarily placed on hold after 125 patients were randomized while the results of another trial were being reviewed and the sponsor decided not to resume enrollment. The interim analysis became the final analysis.
Results:
The median PFS was 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD (n = 65) versus 3.7 months for PLD (n = 60) (hazards ratio, 0.92; P = 0.7243). A preplanned subgroup analysis showed that 75 patients with platinum‐refractory or primary platinum‐resistant OC had a median PFS of 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD versus 2.9 months for PLD (hazards ratio, 0.55; P = 0.0425). Hematologic adverse events were 66% on the treatment A + PLD arm versus 44% on the PLD arm, manageable with dose reductions. Nonhematologic adverse events were similar for both arms. The incidence of palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis was lower on treatment A + PLD (23%, 31%, respectively) versus (39%, 49%, respectively) on PLD.

- The friends who got the special Treatment A and those who didn't had about the same chance of living for a certain amount of time.
- However, the special Treatment A did help reduce the chances of the cancer coming back in the brain or causing more problems in the brain.
- Friends who didn't get the special Treatment A were more likely to need extra treatments later on.

Patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagogastric junction (AEG II and III) were randomly assigned to treatment A followed by surgery or to surgery alone. To detect with 80% power an improvement in median survival from 17 months with surgery alone to 24 months with treatment A, 282 events were required.
Results:
This trial was stopped for poor accrual after 144 patients were randomly assigned (72:72); 52.8% patients had tumors located in the proximal third of the stomach, including AEG type II and III. The International Union against Cancer R0 resection rate was 81.9% after treatment A as compared with 66.7% with surgery alone (P = .036). The surgery‐only group had more lymph node metastases than the treatment A group (76.5% v 61.4%; P = .018).

Imagine there was a big test to see if a new medicine (let's call it Treatment A) could help people with a certain kind of stomach cancer live longer. The test was called a phase III trial, which means it was a big, serious test to see if the treatment really works.

The doctors were very careful to make sure everyone got the same kind of surgery before they tried the new medicine or just the surgery alone. They wanted to see if the medicine could help people live longer than just having surgery.

They planned to check if the medicine could help people live about 7 more months (from 17 months to 24 months) but they needed a lot of people to join the test to be sure. Unfortunately, not enough people joined the test, so they had to stop it early.

Even though the new medicine helped more people have a good surgery (where all the cancer is removed) compared to just having surgery, it didn't help them live longer. This could be because not enough people joined the test, or maybe the kind of cancer these people had was harder to treat than expected, even with the good surgery.

In the end, the doctors learned that the new medicine helped with the surgery but didn't make people live longer. They think this might be because the cancer was in a tricky spot or maybe the surgery they were already doing was really good.

Imagine there was a big test to see if a new medicine (let's call it Treatment A) could help people with a serious stomach cancer live longer when used before surgery. The test was done on people whose cancer was very advanced and hard to treat.

The test was stopped because not enough people joined to make a clear decision. Out of the 144 people who did join, half got the new medicine before surgery, and the other half just had surgery.

After watching these people for about 4 years, on average, those who got the medicine before surgery lived a bit longer than those who just had surgery, but the difference wasn't big enough to be sure it was because of the medicine. The average time they lived was around 5 years and 4 months for those who had the medicine, and about 4 years and 4 months for those who didn't.

About 73% of people who had the medicine were still alive after 2 years, and about 70% of those who just had surgery were still alive at that time. The medicine didn't seem to help people live longer without the cancer getting worse, but it did help doctors remove all the cancer during surgery more often than just surgery alone.

However, people who had the medicine before surgery had more problems after the surgery than those who just had surgery.

Imagine you have a friend who had cancer and now has trouble sleeping. Many people who have had cancer have this problem. There are medicines that can help them sleep, but these medicines can have side effects and are expensive. Plus, some people who had cancer don't want to take these medicines.

Scientists wanted to see if a new treatment, called treatment A, could help these people sleep better without causing too many problems. They gave treatment A or a fake treatment (placebo) to people who were still getting cancer treatment, and they did this for 8 weeks. The main thing they were looking at was how well people slept, and they measured this with a special sleep quality test.

After 8 weeks, the results showed that treatment A didn't make people sleep much better than the fake treatment when they looked at the main test. But when they looked at other things, like how tired people felt and their mood, they found that people taking treatment A felt less tired and had a better mood compared to those taking the fake treatment.

There were no serious side effects from treatment A, but a few people taking the fake treatment had a small increase in something called alkaline phosphatase, which is a sign that their liver might be working a bit harder.

High levels of distress and need for self‐care information by patients commencing chemotherapy suggest that current prechemotherapy education is suboptimal. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of a prechemotherapy education intervention (treatment A) to assess impact on patient distress, treatment‐related concerns, and the prevalence and severity of and bother caused by six chemotherapy side‐effects.
Patients and methods:
One hundred and ninety‐two breast, gastrointestinal, and haematologic cancer patients were recruited before the trial closing prematurely (original target 352). Treatment A was administered before first treatment (intervention 1), 48 h after first treatment (intervention 2), and immediately before second treatment (intervention 3). Patient outcomes were measured at baseline (T1: pre‐education) and immediately preceding treatment cycles 1 (T2) and 3 (T3).
Results:
Treatment A did not significantly reduce patient distress. However, a significant decrease in sensory/psychological (P=0.027) and procedural (P=0.03) concerns, as well as prevalence and severity of and bother due to vomiting (all P=0.001), were observed at T3. In addition, subgroup analysis of patients with elevated distress at T1 indicated a significant decrease (P=0.035) at T2 but not at T3 (P=0.055) in treatment A patients.

Imagine you're about to start a new medicine that might make you feel yucky for a while. Before starting this medicine, some people get really worried and wish they knew more about what to expect and how to feel better. This study was like a special class to help those people before they start their medicine to make them less worried and better prepared.

The researchers gave this special class to 192 people who were going to start a type of medicine called chemotherapy for different kinds of cancer. They gave the class three times: before the first medicine, 48 hours after the first medicine, and just before the second medicine.

After the class, the people felt less worried about certain things like how the medicine would make them feel or what they would have to do. They also had fewer problems with things like throwing up and felt less bothered by it.

However, the class didn't make everyone feel less worried overall. But for those who were very worried at the start, the class did help them feel a bit better right after the first class, but this didn't last until after the third class.

The researchers think this special class is a good start to help people feel better before starting chemotherapy, but they need to try it with more different kinds of people to make sure it works for everyone.

So, in simple terms, the class helped some people feel less worried and better prepared for their chemotherapy, but"

This special help is called ""prechemotherapy education.""

Scientists wanted to see if this special help really makes a difference in how scared and worried kids (and adults) feel before starting chemotherapy. So, they did an experiment with 192 kids and adults who were about to start chemotherapy for different types of cancer.

They divided these people into two groups: one group got the special prechemotherapy education (let's call this Group A), and the other group just got the usual care they would normally get (let's call this Group B).

The scientists checked how scared and worried everyone was before they got the special help (this is called ""baseline""), and then they checked again right before their first treatment (T2) and right before their third treatment (T3).

The results showed that the special help didn't make Group A feel much less scared and worried compared to Group B. The scores that measure how scared and worried they were didn't change much between the groups at T2 and T3.

Patients received docetaxel (75 mg/m2 day 1) and prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily every 21 days with either treatment A or placebo twice daily orally on days 1‐3. The primary end point was overall survival (OS).

A phase III study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) to evaluate the effect on response rate and survival of a treatment A.
Patients and methods:
Four hundred fifty‐six patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B in combination with 5‐FU (500 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) i.v., every 21 days for a maximum of six cycles (eight in case of CR).
Results:
Of 456 patients, 390 were evaluable for efficacy. Objective response (CR + PR) was seen in 57% (treatment A) vs. 41% (comparator B) of the evaluable patients (P = 0.003). The CR rate was higher in the treatment A arm (12% vs. 7%, P = 0.07). Treatment A produced significantly higher response rates in patients with visceral localization (50% vs. 34%, P = 0.011) and in patients with more than two metastatic organ sites (64% vs. 37%, P = 0.001). Median time to progression (7.6 vs. 7 months) and overall survival (18 months vs. 17 months) were similar. Myelosuppression was the principal toxic effect, with grade IV neutropenia observed in 57% of the patients treated with treatment A vs. 9% of those on comparator B.
