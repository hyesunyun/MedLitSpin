Randomized trial of fenretinide to prevent second breast malignancy in women with early breast cancer",J Natl Cancer Inst,"Background:
Treatment A has been shown to inhibit breast carcinogenesis in preclinical studies. We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.
Methods:
We randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30‐70 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66‐1.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64‐1.09; P = .177) between the two arms. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs (38 in the treatment A arm versus 40 in the control arm), incidence of distant metastasis (HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.79‐1.22; P = .858), and all‐cause mortality (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.92‐1.48; P = .215).
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than no treatment in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.",no_spin,"Here's a summary of the passage that a fifth grader can understand:

Scientists wanted to see if a special medicine (called Treatment A) could help prevent breast cancer from coming back in women who already had breast cancer. They gave the medicine to half of the women in the study and didn't give it to the other half. They then watched to see if the women who took the medicine got breast cancer again, and compared it to the women who didn't take the medicine.

After a long time (about 8 years), they looked at the results and found that the medicine didn't make a big difference. The women who took the medicine didn't get breast cancer again any less often than the women who didn't take the medicine. This means that the medicine didn't work as well as they had hoped in preventing breast cancer from coming back.

So, the scientists concluded that taking Treatment A didn't help prevent breast cancer from coming back in women who already had breast cancer."

This passage is about a study that looked at a special medicine called ""Treatment A"" to see if it could help prevent breast cancer from coming back in women who already had breast cancer.

Here's what they did:

* They took a group of 2972 women who had breast cancer and divided them into two groups. One group took the medicine (Treatment A) for 5 years, and the other group didn't take the medicine.
* They then watched to see if the women in each group got breast cancer again, either in the same breast or in the other breast.
* They also looked at other things, like if the cancer spread to other parts of the body or if the women died from any cause.

Here's what they found out:

* Overall, the medicine didn't seem to make a big difference in preventing breast cancer from coming back.
* But, they did find that the medicine might be helpful for women who haven't yet gone through menopause (that's when women stop having periods). For these women, the medicine might reduce the chance of getting breast cancer again.
* On the other hand, the medicine might not be as helpful, or might even be a little harmful, for women who have already gone through menopause.

So, the study didn't find a big benefit from the medicine, but it did find some interesting clues that might be helpful for future research.

I hope that helps"

It is uncertain whether treatment A provides additional benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. This trial was initiated to explore this question.
Patients and methods:
Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization. The two end points of interest for this study were time to treatment failure (TTF) and survival time.
Results:
Median survival was 30.0 months for chemotherapy alone and 29.3 months treatment A and chemotherapy, p=0.834. Time to treatment failure (TTF) was 13.4 months for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with 10.3 month for chemotherapy alone patients (P = .087). The response rates (complete response and partial response) was 69.2% of for patients who received chemotherapy alone and 68.9% for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy, P =.99. There was no significant difference in toxicities seen between the two arms of the study. There were four lethal toxicities. Three infectious deaths occurred in patients receiving treatment A with chemotherapy.

The researchers wanted to know if a new treatment, called Treatment A, would help people with a kind of cancer called metastatic breast cancer. They wanted to see if it would make them live longer or feel better than just getting regular chemotherapy.

They tested this by giving some people just chemotherapy, and others got Treatment A plus chemotherapy. They looked at how long it took for the cancer to start growing again, and how long people lived.

What they found out was that Treatment A didn't really make a difference. People who got just chemotherapy lived about the same amount of time as people who got Treatment A plus chemotherapy. The cancer came back at about the same time for both groups too. Some people got very sick from the treatment, but it wasn't any worse for the people who got Treatment A.

So, the researchers concluded that Treatment A isn't any better than just getting chemotherapy for people with metastatic breast cancer."

It is uncertain whether treatment A provides additional benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. This trial was initiated to explore this question.
Patients and methods:
Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with estrogen receptor (ER)‐positive or ER‐unknown metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization.
Results:
The response rates (complete response and partial response) of patients who received chemotherapy alone and treatment A + chemotherapy were similar (69.2% v 68.9%, respectively; P =.99). Time to treatment failure (TTF) was slightly longer for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone patients (13.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.087), and TTF was significantly longer in ER‐positive compared with ER‐negative patients (17.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.048). However, ER status had no effect on overall survival (30.0 months for chemotherapy alone v 29.3 months for treatment A + chemotherapy).

They looked at 231 people with breast cancer and divided them into two groups. One group got just chemotherapy, and the other group got chemotherapy plus treatment A. They then looked at how well each group did.

What they found out was that both groups had similar results in terms of getting better (about 69% of people in both groups got better). However, the group that got treatment A plus chemotherapy took a little longer to get worse again (about 3 months longer). They also found out that people with a certain type of breast cancer (called ER-positive) did better with treatment A plus chemotherapy.

But here's the important part: even though treatment A plus chemotherapy helped people with ER-positive breast cancer a little bit, it didn't make them live longer overall.

So, the researchers concluded that adding treatment A to chemotherapy might help some people with breast cancer a little bit, but it doesn't make a big difference in how long they live."

Efficacy and safety of treatment A was compared with comparator B in a group of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, without previous systemic therapy for advanced breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
The study was a prospective double‐blind randomized trial. All treated patients presented with positive estrogen receptors. Main end points were response rates, toxicity profile analysis, time to progression and survival. WHO and ECOG criteria were employed for response evaluation while toxicity was assessed according to WHO guidelines. Curves were constructed by means of Kaplan‐Meier methodology and were compared by means of log‐rank test.
Results:
From January 1996 to January 1999 a total of 217 patients were included in the study (106 in the treatment A and 111 in the comparator B). Both groups of patients were homogeneous regarding the main prognostic factors. A response rate of 64% (68/106) was observed in the treatment A group as compared with a 52% (58/111) in the comparator B group. Median times to progression and overall survival were not significantly different. A lower incidence of undesirable effects was appreciated in the treatment A arm.

The researchers wanted to know which medicine would help people with this cancer live longer without the cancer getting worse. They also wanted to know which medicine would make the cancer shrink or go away, and which one would have fewer bad side effects.

They gave one of the two medicines to 400 people with advanced breast cancer and followed them for about 17 months. They found out that:

* Both medicines were about equally good at keeping the cancer from getting worse.
* About 17% of the people who took either medicine had their cancer shrink or go away.
* The people who took Treatment A had their cancer stay gone for a longer time than the people who took Comparator B.
* Both medicines were safe and didn't have too many bad side effects.

So, the researchers concluded that Treatment A is a good option for people with advanced breast cancer who have already tried another medicine called tamoxifen. It's like having another tool in the toolbox to help fight the cancer.

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy with or without treatment A primarily on disease‐free survival (DFS) and secondarily on overall survival (OS) in patients with high‐risk operable breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
From June 1997 until November 2000, 604 patients with T1‐3N1M0 or T3N0M0 tumors were randomized to three cycles of epirubicin 110 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of treatment A followed by three cycles of 'intensified' CMF (cyclophosphamide 840 mg/m2, methotrexate 47 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 840 mg/m2) (group A), or to four cycles of epirubicin followed by four cycles of CMF, as in group A (group B). All cycles were given every 2 weeks with granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor support.

From June 1997 until November 2000, 604 patients with T1‐3N1M0 or T3N0M0 tumors were randomized to three cycles of epirubicin 110 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of treatment A followed by three cycles of 'intensified' CMF (cyclophosphamide 840 mg/m2, methotrexate 47 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 840 mg/m2) (group A), or to four cycles of epirubicin followed by four cycles of CMF, as in group A (group B). All cycles were given every 2 weeks with granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor support.
Results:
A total of 595 patients were eligible. Median follow‐up was 61.7 months for group A and 62 months for group B. The 3‐year DFS was 80% in group A and 77% in group B. Survival rates were 93% and 90%, respectively. The effect of treatment on the hazard of death was different according to hormonal receptor status. More specifically, in patients with negative receptor status the hazard of death was significantly higher for group B (hazard ratio 2.42). Both regimens were well tolerated and severe acute side‐effects were infrequent. No cases of severe cardiotoxicity or acute leukemia were recorded.
Conclusion:
The present study failed to demonstrate a significant difference in DFS or OS between the two treatment groups. However, our study has shown clearly that treatment A can be safely incorporated to dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy.",spin,"I'd be happy to help you explain this passage to your fifth grader.

This passage is about a study that looked at how well two different treatments worked for people with a type of cancer called breast cancer. The researchers wanted to see which treatment was better at helping people live longer and not have the cancer come back.

Imagine you have a big group of people who all have breast cancer. The researchers divided this group into two smaller groups. One group got a treatment called ""Group A,"" and the other group got a treatment called ""Group B."" Both groups got a series of strong medicines to help fight the cancer, but the medicines were given in a slightly different order.

The researchers then looked at how well each group did over time. They wanted to know how many people in each group were still alive and didn't have the cancer come back after a few years.

What they found out was that both groups did pretty well, but there wasn't a big difference between them. However, they did find out that one of the treatments, ""Group A,"" was safer and worked better for people whose cancer was a certain type.

So, the main point of the study was to see if one treatment was better than the other, but it turned out that they were pretty similar. But the researchers did learn some important things that can help doctors make better decisions when treating people with breast cancer in the future.

Does that make sense?"

To determine whether treatment A, improves survival in patients with brain metastases when used as an adjunct to whole‐brain radiation therapy (WBRT).
Patients and methods:
Patients with brain metastases from solid tumors and a Karnofsky performance score of > or = 70 were randomly assigned to receive WBRT with supplemental oxygen and either treatment A (treatment A arm) or no treatment (control arm). The primary end point was survival.
Results:
The study consisted of 515 eligible patients (treatment A arm, n = 265; control arm, n = 250). The median survival time (MST) was 5.4 months for the treatment A arm versus 4.4 months for the control arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87; P = .16). For the subgroup of patients with non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or breast cancer, the MST was 6.0 and 4.4 months, respectively (HR = 0.82; P = .07). Cox multiple regression analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of death for the treatment A arm in both primary populations. Further analysis indicated that the benefit may be restricted to the subgroup of patients with breast cancer. Response rates (radiographic complete response plus partial response) improved by 7% (P = .10) and 13% (P = .01) for all patients and for NSCLC and breast cancer patients in the treatment A arm, respectively. The most common severe adverse event in patients treated with treatment A was hypoxemia, which was reversible and effectively managed with supplemental oxygen in most patients.
Conclusion:
The addition of treatment A to WBRT may improve response rates and survival in patients with brain metastases, particularly metastases from breast cancer. A confirmatory trial for breast cancer patients has been initiated.",spin,"Here's a summary of the passage that a fifth grader can understand:

**What's the problem?**
Some people have cancer that has spread to their brain. This is called brain metastases. Doctors want to find a way to help these people live longer.

**What did the doctors do?**
They took a group of people with brain metastases and divided them into two teams. One team got a special treatment called Treatment A, along with some other usual treatment. The other team just got the usual treatment. The doctors wanted to see if Treatment A made a difference.

**What did they find out?**
The people who got Treatment A lived a little bit longer than the people who didn't get it. The people with breast cancer or lung cancer who got Treatment A did even better. Treatment A also helped some people's tumors get smaller. But some people who got Treatment A had a problem with not getting enough oxygen, which is called hypoxemia. Luckily, this problem could be fixed with some extra oxygen.

**What does it mean?**
The doctors think that adding Treatment A to the usual treatment might help people with brain metastases live longer, especially if they have breast cancer. They want to do more research to make sure this is true.

I hope this helps your fifth grader understand the passage!"

To compare treatment A and comparator B in node‐positive, operable breast cancer patients.
Methods and materials:
This was a randomized, multicenter, phase III trial enrolling 638 eligible women with prior breast surgery and positive axillary dissection. Patients in Arm A received treatment A, with concomitant radiotherapy (50 Gy +/‐ 10‐20‐Gy boost). Patients in Arm B received comparator B, with subsequent radiotherapy.
Results:
Median treatment durations were 64 and 126 days (Arms A and B, respectively), with no significant difference in overall or disease‐free survival. Five‐year locoregional relapse‐free survival favored patients with conservative surgery (two thirds of the population), with less local and / or regional recurrence in Arm A than in Arm B (3% vs. 9%; p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis in this subgroup showed a 2.8‐fold increased risk of locoregional recurrence with comparator B, independent of other prognostic factors (p = 0.027). Febrile neutropenia and Grade 3‐4 leukopenia were significantly more frequent in Arm A. Subclinical left ventricular ejection fraction events at 1 year were more frequent with treatment A (p = 0.02).
Conclusion:
Treatment A has significantly better locoregional control in node‐positive breast cancer after conservative surgery and 50% shorter treatment, albeit with slightly more acute toxicity.",spin,"I'd be happy to help you explain this passage to your fifth grader.

This passage is talking about a study that compared two different treatments for breast cancer. Breast cancer is a kind of sickness that can grow in a woman's breast.

The study wanted to see which treatment was better for women who had breast cancer that had spread to their lymph nodes (that's what ""node-positive"" means). The two treatments were called ""Treatment A"" and ""Comparator B"".

The researchers looked at how long it took for each treatment to work, and how well each treatment helped the women get better. They found out that:

* Treatment A worked just as well as Comparator B in helping the women live longer and not get sick again.
* But Treatment A was better at stopping the cancer from coming back in the same place (that's what ""locoregional control"" means).
* Treatment A also took less time to complete (about half the time of Comparator B).
* However, Treatment A had some more side effects, like making some women feel sick with fever and lowering their white blood cell count.

So, the conclusion is that Treatment A is a good choice for women with breast cancer that has spread to their lymph nodes, because it helps stop the cancer from coming back in the same place and takes less time to complete, even though it might have some more side effects.

This passage is about a study that compared two different treatments for breast cancer. Breast cancer is a kind of sickness that affects the breast. The study wanted to see which treatment was better for helping people with breast cancer get better.

The study had 650 women who had breast cancer and had already had surgery to remove the cancer. The women were divided into two groups: Group A and Group B. Group A got one kind of treatment, and Group B got another kind of treatment.

The researchers looked at how well the women did after five years. They wanted to know if the women were still healthy and if the cancer had come back. They found out that:

* Both groups did pretty well, but Group A did a little bit better. However, the difference wasn't big enough to say that one treatment was definitely better than the other.
* Some women in Group A had more side effects, like getting very sick with a fever or having problems with their blood cells.
* The researchers also found out that the treatment in Group A might have affected the women's hearts a little bit.

So, the conclusion is that the two treatments are pretty similar, and one isn't clearly better than the other. The researchers are trying to figure out the best way to help people with breast cancer get better, and this study is one step in that process.

To assess whether the use of intervention A as an adjunct to colposcopy increases the detection of biopsy confirmed CIN 2, 3 (high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia).
Methods:
This is a multicenter two‐arm randomized trial comparing colposcopy alone with colposcopy plus intervention A. Patients were recruited from 13 colposcopy clinics in a variety of practice settings. 2299 women referred for the evaluation of an abnormal cervical cytology were randomized with stratification by cytology; subsequently 113 women were excluded for a variety of reasons. The main study outcomes were differences in true‐positive rates (CIN 2, 3 and cancer identified) and false‐positive rates between the study arms.
Results:
The true‐positive (TP) rates were 14.4% vs. 11.4% (p=0.035, one‐sided) for the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm compared to colposcopy‐only arm, respectively, in women with either an atypical squamous cell (ASC) or low‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) cytology result. TP rates were similar between the two arms among women referred for the evaluation of HSIL (high‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). The 26.5% gain in true‐positives observed with the use of intervention A and colposcopy among women referred for an ASC or LSIL cytology was achieved with only a fractional increase in number of biopsies obtained per patient (0.30) and a modest increase in false‐positive rate
(4%). In the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm among women with ASC or LSIL, the PPV (positive predictive value) of biopsies indicated by ntervention A was 15.0% and the PPV of biopsies indicated by colposcopy was 15.2%. Joint hypothesis testing indicates that intervention A and colposcopy provides benefit compared to colposcopy alone among women with ASC or LSIL.

This passage is talking about a medical study that was done to see if a new treatment (called ""Treatment A"") helps people with breast cancer. Breast cancer is a kind of sickness that affects the breast tissue.

The researchers wanted to know if adding Treatment A to a usual treatment (called CAF) would make the cancer go away better than just using CAF alone. They also wanted to see if it was safe to use Treatment A with CAF.

Here's what they did:

* They gave some people CAF and a fake treatment (called a placebo) to see how well they did.
* They gave other people CAF and Treatment A to see how well they did.
* They looked at how many people got better (their cancer went away or got smaller) and how long it took for the cancer to come back.

What they found out was:

* Adding Treatment A to CAF didn't make the cancer go away any better than just using CAF alone.
* The people who got Treatment A with CAF had more side effects (like feeling sick or getting infections) than the people who just got CAF.
* Treatment A didn't change how well the other medicine (doxorubicin) worked.

So, the conclusion is that adding Treatment A to CAF doesn't help people with breast cancer more than just using CAF alone.

In 1996, we initiated the multicenter phase III randomized trial to compare the effect on disease‐free survival (DFS) of experimental treatment A versus comparator B after breast‐conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer. This report presents the clinical results with a median follow‐up of 60 months.
Patients and methods:
Between February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery.
Results:
There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5‐year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis‐free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76).

A long time ago, in 1996, some doctors started a big study to see which treatment was better for women who had breast cancer. They wanted to know if one treatment, called ""Treatment A"", was better than another treatment, called ""Comparator B"". They looked at 716 women who had surgery to remove the cancer, and then gave them one of the two treatments.

After following these women for 5 years, the doctors found out that both treatments were pretty much the same in terms of helping the women stay healthy and not get cancer again. However, they did find out that Treatment A was a little better for women who had cancer in their lymph nodes (which are like filters in your body that help fight infection).

So, the doctors think that Treatment A is a good option for women who have breast cancer and are at high risk of getting it again. They also think that it would be a good idea to try new medicines to see if they can make the treatment even better.

Treatment A is effective against HER‐2‐positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy of treatment A in HER‐2‐negative and HER‐2‐uncharacterized MBC.
Patients and methods:
Women with MBC were randomly assigned to first‐line therapy with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks plus treatment A or placebo. A preplanned retrospective evaluation of HER‐2 status was performed using fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP); secondary end points were objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), event‐free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS).

* Both medicines helped about the same number of people get better (that's called ""overall response rate"").
* Both medicines helped people live for about the same amount of time (that's called ""overall survival"").
* But, Treatment A was a little better at keeping people on the medicine for a longer time without having to stop because of bad side effects.
* Treatment A also had fewer bad side effects, like diarrhea, mouth sores, and hand and foot problems.
* However, Treatment A did have some side effects, like low white blood cell count and needing blood transfusions, that were a little worse than Comparator B.

So, what does it all mean? The study found that Treatment A might be a better choice than Comparator B because it has fewer bad side effects and helps people stay on the medicine for a longer time. But, it's not a huge difference, and both medicines have their own good and bad points.

41,20087643,A bupropion smoking cessation clinical trial for cancer patients,Cancer Causes Control,"Objective:
Many cancer patients continue to smoke postdiagnosis, yet there have been few smoking cessation trials for this population. Depression, which is prevalent among cancer patients, may be a barrier to cessation.
Methods:
This double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial randomized 246 cancer patients to 9 weeks of placebo or treatment A, stratifying by pre‐treatment depression symptoms. In addition, all patients received transdermal nicotine and behavioral counseling. Primary outcomes were 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence, biochemically confirmed, at the end of treatment (Week 12), and at 6 months post quit day (Week 27). Additional outcomes included: withdrawal, affect, quality of life, compliance, and side effects.
Results:
There was no main effect of treatment A vs. placebo on abstinence (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.38‐4.81, p = 0.64). Patients with depression symptoms reported significantly lower abstinence rates vs. patients without depression symptoms (OR = .14, 95% CI: 0.02‐0.80, p=0.03). Treatment A increased abstinence rates, vs. placebo, more for participants with depression vs. those without depression symptoms. For patients with depression symptoms, treatment A reduced withdrawal symptoms and improved quality of life vs. placebo.
Conclusion:
For patients with depression symptoms, treatment increases abstinence rates, lowers withdrawal, and increases quality of life. However, abstinence rates among patients with depression symptoms were low vs. patients without depression symptoms, who exhibited similar abstinence rates when treated with treatment A or transdermal nicotine and counseling alone. These results can guide future smoking cessation intervention studies with cancer patients.",spin,"Here's a summary of the passage that a fifth grader can understand:

One group got a special medicine (called ""treatment A"") to help them quit smoking, and the other group got a fake medicine (called a ""placebo"").

The researchers wanted to see if the people who got the special medicine were more likely to quit smoking than the people who got the fake medicine. They also wanted to see if the people who were sad or depressed had a harder time quitting smoking.

What they found out was that the people who were sad or depressed had a harder time quitting smoking, no matter what medicine they got. But, the people who got the special medicine and were sad or depressed were more likely to quit smoking than the people who got the fake medicine and were sad or depressed. The special medicine also helped people with depression feel better and have fewer withdrawal symptoms (like headaches or feeling grumpy) when they quit smoking.

502 patients were randomly assigned to receive comparator B and 504 to receive combined treatment A. Median follow‐up was 37.2 months (24.8‐52.3).

Here's what they found out:

* The medicine helped people's blood counts get better faster.
* The medicine didn't make a big difference in how long people lived, except for people who had a certain type of AML.
* The researchers found that some things helped people live longer: getting the medicine, being a girl, and only needing one round of treatment.
* Girls with AML did better than boys with AML, and the researchers want to study this more to understand why.

That's the main idea of the passage!"

A two‐arm, double‐blind, randomized trial was performed to evaluate the effect of treatment A on acute skin‐related toxicity in patients undergoing breast or chest wall radiotherapy.
Methods and material:
Patients with ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast carcinoma who were undergoing external beam radiotherapy to the breast or chest wall were randomly assigned to apply treatment A or placebo cream daily. The primary study endpoint was the provider assessed maximal grade of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, radiation dermatitis.
Results:
A total of 176 patients were enrolled between September 21, 2007, and December 7, 2007. The provider assessed primary endpoint showed no difference in the mean maximum grade of radiation dermatitis by treatment arm (1.2+/‐0.85 for treatment A vs. 1.3+/‐0.80 for placebo; p = .18). Severe radiation dermatitis concerned 4 (5%) in both arms; p=.97. The worst grade of any type of toxicity were respectively in the placebo and treatment A groups 9% vs. 2% for grade 3 or 4: 24% vs. 30% for grade 2; 61% vs. 40% for grade 1; and 6% vs. 27% for grade 0; p = .04. For the patient‐reported outcome, the maximum Skindex‐16 score for the treatment A group did not differ between the MMF arm (mean = 1.4) vs. placebo arm (mean = 1.7); p=0.07. The mean score for overall quality of life was 8.3 for treatment A vs. 8.4 for placebo; P> .05.

Treatment A during radiotherapy was not more effective than placebo on acute skin related toxicity in patients undergoing breast or chest wall radiotherapy.",no_spin,"I'd be happy to help you explain this passage to your fifth grader.

This passage is talking about a special study that was done to see if a certain cream (called ""Treatment A"") can help reduce skin problems that happen when people get radiation therapy for breast cancer.

Radiation therapy is a way to treat cancer, but it can sometimes cause skin problems like redness, itching, and burning. The researchers wanted to see if using Treatment A cream on the skin would make these problems less severe.

They did an experiment where they divided 176 patients into two groups: one group used the Treatment A cream, and the other group used a fake cream (called a ""placebo""). They then looked at how bad the skin problems were in each group.

What they found out was that the Treatment A cream didn't really make a big difference in reducing the skin problems. The people who used the Treatment A cream had about the same amount of skin problems as the people who used the fake cream.

So, the conclusion is that the Treatment A cream isn't really effective in reducing skin problems caused by radiation therapy for breast cancer.

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment A in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer (OC).
Methods:
Patients with platinum‐refractory or ‐resistant primary or secondary) OC were randomized to receive treatment A and PLD at 50 mg/m2 intravenously or PLD alone at 50 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 every 28 days until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression‐free survival (PFS). Other end points were objective response rate and safety. The study was originally planned for 244 patients. The trial was temporarily placed on hold after 125 patients were randomized while the results of another trial were being reviewed and the sponsor decided not to resume enrollment. The interim analysis became the final analysis.
Results:
The median PFS was 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD (n = 65) versus 3.7 months for PLD (n = 60) (hazards ratio, 0.92; P = 0.7243). A preplanned subgroup analysis showed that 75 patients with platinum‐refractory or primary platinum‐resistant OC had a median PFS of 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD versus 2.9 months for PLD (hazards ratio, 0.55; P = 0.0425). Hematologic adverse events were 66% on the treatment A + PLD arm versus 44% on the PLD arm, manageable with dose reductions. Nonhematologic adverse events were similar for both arms. The incidence of palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis was lower on treatment A + PLD (23%, 31%, respectively) versus (39%, 49%, respectively) on PLD.
Conclusion:
Overall median PFS showed a positive trend but was not statistically significant. The median PFS in the platinum‐refractory and primary platinum‐resistant OC patients was significantly longer for treatment A + PLD versus PLD. Treatment A may ameliorate the palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis known to be associated with PLD.

This phase III trial assesses whether treatment A increases the duration of functional independence after surgery or radiosurgery of brain metastases.
Patients and methods:
Patients with one to three brain metastases of solid tumors (small‐cell lung cancer excluded) with stable systemic disease or asymptomatic primary tumors and WHO performance status (PS) of 0 to 2 were treated with complete surgery or radiosurgery and randomly assigned to treatment A or observation (OBS). The primary end point was time to WHO PS deterioration to more than 2.
Results:
Of 359 patients, 199 underwent radiosurgery, and 160 underwent surgery. In the radiosurgery group, 100 patients were allocated to OBS, and 99 were allocated to treatment A. After surgery, 79 patients were allocated to OBS, and 81 were allocated to treatment A. The median time to WHO PS more than 2 was 10.0 months (95% CI, 8.1 to 11.7 months) after OBS and 9.5 months (95% CI, 7.8 to 11.9 months) after treatment A (P = .71). Overall survival was similar in the treatment A and OBS arms (median, 10.9 v 10.7 months, respectively; P = .89).

This passage is talking about a medical study that looked at how to help people who have cancer that has spread to their brain. The cancer has formed small tumors in their brain, and the doctors want to find out the best way to treat these tumors.

The doctors tried two different approaches:

1. They did surgery or a special kind of radiation treatment (called radiosurgery) to remove or shrink the tumors.
2. They then divided the patients into two groups: one group got an extra treatment (called treatment A), and the other group didn't get this extra treatment (they were just observed).

The doctors wanted to see if the extra treatment (treatment A) would help the patients stay healthy and independent for a longer time. They also wanted to see if it would help them live longer.

What they found out was that the extra treatment (treatment A) did help in some ways:

* It reduced the chance of the cancer coming back in the same place or in new places in the brain.
* It also reduced the number of people who died because the cancer in their brain got worse.

However, the extra treatment didn't help the patients stay healthy and independent for a longer time, and it didn't help them live longer overall.

So, the doctors learned that treatment A is helpful in some ways, but it's not a magic solution that makes everything better. They'll keep studying to find even better ways"

We examined the value of treatment A in a phase III trial with strict preoperative staging and surgical resection guidelines.
Patients and methods:
Patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagogastric junction (AEG II and III) were randomly assigned to treatment A followed by surgery or to surgery alone. To detect with 80% power an improvement in median survival from 17 months with surgery alone to 24 months with treatment A, 282 events were required.
Results:
This trial was stopped for poor accrual after 144 patients were randomly assigned (72:72); 52.8% patients had tumors located in the proximal third of the stomach, including AEG type II and III. The International Union against Cancer R0 resection rate was 81.9% after treatment A as compared with 66.7% with surgery alone (P = .036). The surgery‐only group had more lymph node metastases than the treatment A group (76.5% v 61.4%; P = .018).

After a median follow‐up of 4.4 years and 67 deaths, a survival benefit could not be shown (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.35; P = .466).
Conclusion:
This trial showed a significantly increased R0 resection rate but failed to demonstrate a survival benefit. Possible explanations are low statistical power, a high rate of proximal gastric cancer including AEG and/or a better outcome than expected after radical surgery alone due to the high quality of surgery with resections of regional lymph nodes outside the perigastic area (celiac trunc, hepatic ligament, lymph node at a. lienalis; D2).",spin,"I'd be happy to help you explain this passage to your fifth grader.

Secondary outcomes included the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Toxicity was evaluated with both self‐reported numeric analogue scale questions and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0. Questionnaires were completed at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks. A total of 227 patients were randomized into this study between March 19, 2004, and March 9, 2007. Twenty‐three patients withdrew before starting the study treatment. Primary end‐point data were available on 119 patients (62 receiving treatment A and 57 receiving placebo). Baseline characteristics and baseline patient reported outcomes were well balanced between arms. The AUC over the 8 weeks for treatment A was 51.4 (SD = 16 and for placebo was 49.7 (SD = 15), with a P value of 0.7. The FOSQ was not statistically significantly different between groups. There was no statistically significant difference between groups for the POMS week 8 treatment A 6.9 vs. placebo 6.0; p=0.90. For the BFI at week 8 the treatment A and placebo arm scored respectively for fatigue now 22.1 vs. 10.5; p<0.01; for usual fatigue 19.4 vs. 10.0; p=0.05; for worst fatigue 14.8 vs. 12.4; p=0.65; and for activity inference 12.3 vs. 10.8; p=0.75.There were no significant differences in toxicities as measured by self‐report or the CTCAE. Treatment A was not more effective than placebo on sleep quality in patients who were undergoing cancer treatment.",no_spin,"Here's a summary of the passage that a fifth grader can understand:

Some people who have had cancer have trouble sleeping. This is a big problem because it can make them feel tired and unhappy. There are some medicines that can help people sleep, but they can have bad side effects and are expensive. So, scientists wanted to try a new way to help people with cancer sleep better.

They tested a new treatment (called ""treatment A"") on a group of people who had cancer and were having trouble sleeping. They compared it to a fake treatment (called a ""placebo"") to see if it really worked. They asked the people in the study to take the treatment or the placebo before bedtime for 8 weeks and then answered some questions about how they were sleeping and feeling.

The scientists found out that the new treatment didn't work any better than the fake treatment in helping people sleep. It didn't make them feel more awake or happy either. But it didn't have any bad side effects, which is good. So, the scientists are still looking for a better way to help people with cancer sleep better.

Does that make sense?"
5,21471562,"Impact of a novel nurse-led prechemotherapy education intervention (ChemoEd) on patient distress, symptom burden, and treatment-related information and support needs: results from a randomised, controlled trial",Ann Oncol,"Background: 
High levels of distress and need for self‐care information by patients commencing chemotherapy suggest that current prechemotherapy education is suboptimal. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of a prechemotherapy education intervention (treatment A) to assess impact on patient distress, treatment‐related concerns, and the prevalence and severity of and bother caused by six chemotherapy side‐effects.
Patients and methods:
One hundred and ninety‐two breast, gastrointestinal, and haematologic cancer patients were recruited before the trial closing prematurely (original target 352). Treatment A was administered before first treatment (intervention 1), 48 h after first treatment (intervention 2), and immediately before second treatment (intervention 3). Patient outcomes were measured at baseline (T1: pre‐education) and immediately preceding treatment cycles 1 (T2) and 3 (T3).
Results:
Treatment A did not significantly reduce patient distress. However, a significant decrease in sensory/psychological (P=0.027) and procedural (P=0.03) concerns, as well as prevalence and severity of and bother due to vomiting (all P=0.001), were observed at T3. In addition, subgroup analysis of patients with elevated distress at T1 indicated a significant decrease (P=0.035) at T2 but not at T3 (P=0.055) in treatment A patients.
Conclusion:
Treatment A holds promise to improve patient treatment‐related concerns and some physical/psychological outcomes; however, further research is required on more diverse patient populations to ensure generalisability.",spin,"Here's a summary of the passage that a fifth grader can understand:

Imagine you're very sick and need to take some strong medicine to get better. Before you start taking the medicine, doctors and nurses usually explain what's going to happen and how you might feel. But sometimes, people still feel very worried and scared when they start taking the medicine.

The researchers in this study wanted to see if they could make a special program to help people feel less worried and scared before they start taking the medicine. They tried this program with 192 people who had different kinds of cancer.

The program had three parts: one before the medicine, one after the first dose, and one before the second dose. The researchers asked the people how they were feeling before and after each part of the program.

What they found out was that the program didn't make people feel less worried overall. But it did help people feel less worried about some specific things, like getting sick to their stomach or feeling scared about the medicine. It also helped people who were very worried at the beginning feel a little better.

The researchers think that this program might be helpful, but they need to try it with more people to make sure it works for everyone."

The researchers wanted to help people who are about to start chemotherapy (a strong medicine to treat cancer) feel less worried and scared. They thought that maybe if they taught these people some special things before they started the medicine, it would help them feel better.

So, they did an experiment with 192 people who had different kinds of cancer. They divided the people into two groups: one group got some extra teaching and help before they started the medicine, and the other group didn't get that extra help.

The researchers then asked the people in both groups how they were feeling at different times during their treatment. They wanted to know if the extra teaching and help made a difference in how worried or scared the people felt.

What they found out was that the extra teaching and help didn't really make a big difference in how worried or scared the people felt. However, it did help a little bit with some specific worries, like feeling sick to their stomach or being worried about the treatment process.

So, the researchers concluded that the extra teaching and help wasn't really more effective than just getting the usual care and treatment."

Treatment A, has activity alone and in combination with docetaxel (Taxotere) and prednisone (DP) in metastatic castration‐resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). A randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled phase II trial compared DP combined with either treatment A (A) or placebo in chemonaive mCRPC.
Patients and methods:
Men with progressive mCRPC despite androgen deprivation were eligible and randomized 1:1. Patients received docetaxel (75 mg/m2 day 1) and prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily every 21 days with either treatment A or placebo twice daily orally on days 1‐3. The primary end point was overall survival (OS).
Results:
Two hundred and twenty‐one patients were randomly assigned. Median OS for treatment A plus docetaxel‐prednisone (ADP) and placebo‐DP was 18.1 versus 17.8 months [hazard ratio (HR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.72‐1.55, P=0.63]. Secondary end points were also not statistically different. Grade 3/4 toxic effects for ADP versus placebo‐DP were cardiac events (5% versus 2%), lymphopenia (23% versus 16%), neutropenia (47% versus 40%), ileus (2% versus 0%) and pulmonary embolism (6% versus 2%). In a subgroup of high‐risk mCRPC (n=34), outcomes appeared to favor ADP (median OS 19 versus 14 months).
Conclusion:
Treatment A was tolerable but did not extend OS when combined with DP in mCRPC; a potential benefit was observed in high‐risk patients.",spin,"I'd be happy to help you explain this passage to your fifth grader.

This passage is talking about a medical study that tested a new treatment for a type of cancer called prostate cancer. The cancer had already spread to other parts of the body and wasn't responding to other treatments.

The researchers wanted to see if adding a new medicine (called Treatment A) to two other medicines (docetaxel and prednisone) would help people with this type of cancer live longer. They compared two groups of patients: one group got the new medicine plus the two other medicines, and the other group got just the two other medicines (without the new medicine).

The results showed that the new medicine didn't make a big difference in how long people lived. However, the researchers did notice that the new medicine might be helpful for a smaller group of patients who were very sick.

The study also looked at the side effects of the medicines, like heart problems, low white blood cell count, and other issues. The researchers found that the new medicine didn't make these side effects much worse.

So, in simple terms, the study was trying to find out if a new medicine could help people with a certain type of cancer live longer, but it didn't seem to make a big difference. However, it might be helpful for some very sick patients.

How was that? Did I help make it more understandable for your fifth grader?"

A phase III study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) to evaluate the effect on response rate and survival of a treatment A.
Patients and methods:
Four hundred fifty‐six patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B in combination with 5‐FU (500 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) i.v., every 21 days for a maximum of six cycles (eight in case of CR).
Results:
Of 456 patients, 390 were evaluable for efficacy. Objective response (CR + PR) was seen in 57% (treatment A) vs. 41% (comparator B) of the evaluable patients (P = 0.003). The CR rate was higher in the treatment A arm (12% vs. 7%, P = 0.07). Treatment A produced significantly higher response rates in patients with visceral localization (50% vs. 34%, P = 0.011) and in patients with more than two metastatic organ sites (64% vs. 37%, P = 0.001). Median time to progression (7.6 vs. 7 months) and overall survival (18 months vs. 17 months) were similar. Myelosuppression was the principal toxic effect, with grade IV neutropenia observed in 57% of the patients treated with treatment A vs. 9% of those on comparator B. Grade IV infection or febrile neutropenia were observed in 8% (treatment A) vs. 0.4% (comparator B), but the incidence of septic death was the same in the two arms (two patients each). Cardiac toxicity was similar in the two treatment groups, with 5% vs. 3% of the patients taken off study due to cardiac events, primarily due to a decline in LVEF. Only three patients (two in treatment A) experienced congestive heart failure.

They gave 456 patients one of two treatments, called Treatment A or Treatment B. They looked at how well each treatment worked and what side effects the patients had.

The results showed that Treatment A worked better than Treatment B in making the cancer smaller or go away. However, Treatment A also had more side effects, like making people's blood counts go down and causing infections. But, the good news is that Treatment A didn't make people's hearts worse, which was a concern.

The bad news is that even though Treatment A worked better, it didn't help people live longer. So, the researchers learned that Treatment A is a good option for people with this type of cancer, but it needs to be used carefully because of the side effects.
