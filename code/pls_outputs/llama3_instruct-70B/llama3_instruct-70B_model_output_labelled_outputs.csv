Randomized trial of fenretinide to prevent second breast malignancy in women with early breast cancer",J Natl Cancer Inst,"Background:
Treatment A has been shown to inhibit breast carcinogenesis in preclinical studies. We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.
Methods:
We randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30‐70 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66‐1.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64‐1.09; P = .177) between the two arms. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs (38 in the treatment A arm versus 40 in the control arm), incidence of distant metastasis (HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.79‐1.22; P = .858), and all‐cause mortality (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.92‐1.48; P = .215).
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than no treatment in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.",no_spin,"Here's a summary of the passage that a fifth grader can understand:

Scientists did a big study to see if a special medicine (called Treatment A) could help prevent breast cancer from coming back in women who already had breast cancer. They gave the medicine to half of the women and didn't give it to the other half. Then, they waited to see what happened.

After a long time, they looked at the results and found out that the medicine didn't make a big difference. The women who took the medicine didn't get breast cancer again any less often than the women who didn't take the medicine.

So, the scientists concluded that the medicine isn't very helpful in preventing breast cancer from coming back. This is important to know because sometimes people might try to make the results of a study sound better than they really are, and that's not honest.

In simple terms, the study found that the medicine didn't work very well, and we should be careful not to believe everything we read or hear about studies like this."

The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization.

The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (P =.642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (P =.177) between the two arms. However, an interaction was detected between treatment A and menopausal status in both outcomes (P for interaction in both outcomes =.045), with a possible beneficial effect in premenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66, and 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.41‐1.07; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 0.65, and 95% CI = 0.46‐0. 92) and an opposite effect in postmenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.32, and 95% CI = 0.82‐2.15; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.19, and 95% CI = 0.75‐1. 89). There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs, incidence of distant metastasis, and all‐cause mortality.
Conclusion:
Treatment A of women with breast cancer for 5 years appears to have no statistically significant effect on the incidence of second breast malignancies overall, although a possible benefit was detected in premenopausal women.

Scientists did a study to see if a special medicine (called Treatment A) could help prevent breast cancer from coming back in women who already had breast cancer. They gave the medicine to some women and not to others, and then they watched to see what happened over time.

What they found out was that the medicine didn't seem to make a big difference overall. But, they did notice that it might be helpful for younger women (who haven't gone through menopause yet). For older women (who have gone through menopause), the medicine might actually do more harm than good.

The scientists are saying that we need to be careful when we look at the results of this study because it's possible that they're not telling the whole story. Sometimes, scientists can make their results sound more exciting or important than they really are, and that's not honest.

So, the main idea is that the medicine didn't work as well as they hoped, but it might be helpful for some younger women. We just need to be careful when we look at the results and make sure we're not getting a biased view."

It is uncertain whether treatment A provides additional benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. This trial was initiated to explore this question.
Patients and methods:
Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization. The two end points of interest for this study were time to treatment failure (TTF) and survival time.
Results:
Median survival was 30.0 months for chemotherapy alone and 29.3 months treatment A and chemotherapy, p=0.834. Time to treatment failure (TTF) was 13.4 months for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with 10.3 month for chemotherapy alone patients (P = .087). The response rates (complete response and partial response) was 69.2% of for patients who received chemotherapy alone and 68.9% for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy, P =.99. There was no significant difference in toxicities seen between the two arms of the study. There were four lethal toxicities. Three infectious deaths occurred in patients receiving treatment A with chemotherapy.

This is a study about a new way to treat breast cancer. The researchers wanted to see if adding a special treatment (called ""treatment A"") to the usual chemotherapy would help people with breast cancer live longer or get better faster.

They tested this on 231 people with breast cancer and divided them into two groups: one group got the usual chemotherapy, and the other group got the chemotherapy plus treatment A. They then looked at how long it took for the cancer to come back and how long the people lived.

What they found out was that adding treatment A didn't make a big difference. The people who got treatment A and chemotherapy didn't live longer or get better faster than the people who just got chemotherapy. They also didn't find any big differences in how many people got better or how many people had bad side effects.

So, the conclusion is that adding treatment A to chemotherapy doesn't really help people with breast cancer.

It is uncertain whether treatment A provides additional benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. This trial was initiated to explore this question.
Patients and methods:
Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with estrogen receptor (ER)‐positive or ER‐unknown metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization.
Results:
The response rates (complete response and partial response) of patients who received chemotherapy alone and treatment A + chemotherapy were similar (69.2% v 68.9%, respectively; P =.99). Time to treatment failure (TTF) was slightly longer for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone patients (13.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.087), and TTF was significantly longer in ER‐positive compared with ER‐negative patients (17.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.048). However, ER status had no effect on overall survival (30.0 months for chemotherapy alone v 29.3 months for treatment A + chemotherapy).
Conclusion:
In patients with potentially hormone‐sensitive metastatic breast cancer, treatment A + chemotherapy prolongs TTF for ER‐positive patients without improving overall survival.",spin,"I'd be happy to help you explain this passage to your fifth grader.

This passage is about a study that looked at two different ways to treat a type of cancer called breast cancer. The researchers wanted to see if adding a special treatment (called ""treatment A"") to the usual chemotherapy would make a difference in how well the patients did.

They looked at 231 patients who had breast cancer that had spread to other parts of their body. They divided the patients into two groups: one group got just chemotherapy, and the other group got chemotherapy plus treatment A.

The results showed that both groups had similar numbers of patients who got better (about 69% in both groups). However, the group that got treatment A plus chemotherapy took a little longer to get worse again (about 3 months longer). But, sadly, it didn't make a difference in how long the patients lived overall.

So, the main finding of the study is that adding treatment A to chemotherapy might help some patients with a certain type of breast cancer feel better for a little longer, but it doesn't change how long they live.

Efficacy and safety of treatment A was compared with comparator B in a group of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, without previous systemic therapy for advanced breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
The study was a prospective double‐blind randomized trial. All treated patients presented with positive estrogen receptors. Main end points were response rates, toxicity profile analysis, time to progression and survival. WHO and ECOG criteria were employed for response evaluation while toxicity was assessed according to WHO guidelines. Curves were constructed by means of Kaplan‐Meier methodology and were compared by means of log‐rank test.
Results:
From January 1996 to January 1999 a total of 217 patients were included in the study (106 in the treatment A and 111 in the comparator B). Both groups of patients were homogeneous regarding the main prognostic factors. A response rate of 64% (68/106) was observed in the treatment A group as compared with a 52% (58/111) in the comparator B group. Median times to progression and overall survival were not significantly different. A lower incidence of undesirable effects was appreciated in the treatment A arm.
Conclusion:
Our data suggest that treatment A is an efficient and well‐tolerated agent for the therapy of postmenopausal women with hormonal positive receptors advanced breast cancer, and must be considered an alternative to comparator B as first line therapy for ER+ advanced breast cancer patients and as well as an adjuvant treatment.",spin,"I'd be happy to help you explain this passage to your fifth grader.

This passage is about a study that compared two different treatments for breast cancer in women who have gone through menopause. The researchers wanted to see which treatment was better and safer.

Here's what they did:

* They chose 217 women with breast cancer and divided them into two groups. One group got treatment A, and the other group got treatment B.
* They looked at how well each treatment worked and how many bad side effects each group had.
* They found out that treatment A worked a little better than treatment B, and it also had fewer bad side effects.

So, what does this mean? It means that treatment A might be a good choice for women with breast cancer who have gone through menopause. It seems to work well and doesn't have as many bad side effects as treatment B.

The last part of the passage is talking about how sometimes people might make a study sound better than it really is by only telling part of the truth. But in this case, the study seems to be honest and trustworthy.

All cycles were given every 2 weeks with granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor support.
Results:
A total of 595 patients were eligible. Median follow‐up was 61.7 months for group A and 62 months for group B. The 3‐year DFS was 80% in group A and 77% in group B. Survival rates were 93% and 90%, respectively. The effect of treatment on the hazard of death was different according to hormonal receptor status. More specifically, in patients with negative receptor status the hazard of death was significantly higher for group B (hazard ratio 2.42). Both regimens were well tolerated and severe acute side‐effects were infrequent. No cases of severe cardiotoxicity or acute leukemia were recorded.
Conclusion:
The present study failed to demonstrate a significant difference in DFS or OS between the two treatment groups. However, our study has shown clearly that treatment A can be safely incorporated to dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy.",spin,"Here's a summary of the passage that a fifth grader can understand:

This is a study about a type of cancer called breast cancer. The researchers wanted to see if a certain way of giving medicine to patients with breast cancer would help them live longer and be healthier. They looked at two groups of patients: one group got a special medicine called ""treatment A"" along with other medicines, and the other group just got the other medicines.

The researchers found out that both groups of patients did about the same - they didn't find a big difference between the two groups. But they did find out that the special medicine ""treatment A"" is safe to use with the other medicines.

The important thing to know is that the researchers didn't find a ""winner"" between the two groups, but they did learn something new that can help doctors take care of patients with breast cancer.

As for the ""spin"" part, it means that sometimes researchers might make their results sound more exciting or important than they really are. So, we need to be careful when we read about studies and make sure we understand what they really found out.

Does that make sense?"
51,16314619,Phase III study of efaproxiral as an adjunct to whole-brain radiation therapy for brain metastases,J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
To determine whether treatment A, improves survival in patients with brain metastases when used as an adjunct to whole‐brain radiation therapy (WBRT).
Patients and methods:
Patients with brain metastases from solid tumors and a Karnofsky performance score of > or = 70 were randomly assigned to receive WBRT with supplemental oxygen and either treatment A (treatment A arm) or no treatment (control arm). The primary end point was survival.
Results:
The study consisted of 515 eligible patients (treatment A arm, n = 265; control arm, n = 250). The median survival time (MST) was 5.4 months for the treatment A arm versus 4.4 months for the control arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87; P = .16). For the subgroup of patients with non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or breast cancer, the MST was 6.0 and 4.4 months, respectively (HR = 0.82; P = .07). Cox multiple regression analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of death for the treatment A arm in both primary populations. Further analysis indicated that the benefit may be restricted to the subgroup of patients with breast cancer. Response rates (radiographic complete response plus partial response) improved by 7% (P = .10) and 13% (P = .01) for all patients and for NSCLC and breast cancer patients in the treatment A arm, respectively. The most common severe adverse event in patients treated with treatment A was hypoxemia, which was reversible and effectively managed with supplemental oxygen in most patients.
Conclusion:
The addition of treatment A to WBRT may improve response rates and survival in patients with brain metastases, particularly metastases from breast cancer. A confirmatory trial for breast cancer patients has been initiated.",spin,"Here's a summary of the passage that a fifth grader can understand:

The results showed that the people who got the new treatment lived a little bit longer than the people who didn't get it. But the difference wasn't huge. The researchers also found that the new treatment seemed to work better for people who had a specific type of cancer called breast cancer.

The new treatment did have some side effects, like making people feel short of breath, but most of the time, this could be fixed by giving them extra oxygen.

So, the researchers think that the new treatment might be helpful for people with cancer in their brain, especially if they have breast cancer. They want to do more studies to make sure this is true.

To compare treatment A and comparator B in node‐positive, operable breast cancer patients.
Methods and materials:
This was a randomized, multicenter, phase III trial enrolling 638 eligible women with prior breast surgery and positive axillary dissection. Patients in Arm A received treatment A, with concomitant radiotherapy (50 Gy +/‐ 10‐20‐Gy boost). Patients in Arm B received comparator B, with subsequent radiotherapy.
Results:
Median treatment durations were 64 and 126 days (Arms A and B, respectively), with no significant difference in overall or disease‐free survival. Five‐year locoregional relapse‐free survival favored patients with conservative surgery (two thirds of the population), with less local and / or regional recurrence in Arm A than in Arm B (3% vs. 9%; p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis in this subgroup showed a 2.8‐fold increased risk of locoregional recurrence with comparator B, independent of other prognostic factors (p = 0.027). Febrile neutropenia and Grade 3‐4 leukopenia were significantly more frequent in Arm A. Subclinical left ventricular ejection fraction events at 1 year were more frequent with treatment A (p = 0.02).
Conclusion:
Treatment A has significantly better locoregional control in node‐positive breast cancer after conservative surgery and 50% shorter treatment, albeit with slightly more acute toxicity.",spin,"I'd be happy to help you explain this passage to your fifth grader.

This passage is about a study that compared two different treatments for breast cancer. Breast cancer is a type of disease that affects the breast tissue in women.

The study looked at two groups of women who had breast cancer that had spread to their lymph nodes (that's what ""node-positive"" means). One group got a treatment called ""Treatment A"", and the other group got a treatment called ""Comparator B"".

The researchers wanted to see which treatment was better at helping the women get better. They looked at how long it took for the women to finish their treatment, and how well they did after that.

Here's what they found out:

* Both treatments took about the same amount of time to complete.
* Both treatments helped the women live just as long, and kept the cancer from coming back just as well.
* But, Treatment A was better at keeping the cancer from coming back in the same area where it started (that's what ""locoregional control"" means).
* Treatment A also had some side effects, like making the women more likely to get a fever and have low white blood cell counts.
* The other treatment, Comparator B, didn't have as many side effects, but it wasn't as good at keeping the cancer from coming back.

So, the researchers concluded that Treatment A is a good choice for women with breast cancer that has spread to their lymph nodes, because it helps keep the cancer"

The results showed that both treatments were pretty similar. About 83% of the women who got treatment A were cancer-free after 5 years, and about 79% of the women who got treatment B were cancer-free after 5 years. This means that treatment A wasn't really better than treatment B.

However, the researchers did find some differences between the two treatments. Treatment A had some more side effects, like fever and low white blood cell count, than treatment B. Also, treatment A seemed to affect the heart a bit more than treatment B.

To assess whether the use of intervention A as an adjunct to colposcopy increases the detection of biopsy confirmed CIN 2, 3 (high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia).
Methods:
This is a multicenter two‐arm randomized trial comparing colposcopy alone with colposcopy plus intervention A. Patients were recruited from 13 colposcopy clinics in a variety of practice settings. 2299 women referred for the evaluation of an abnormal cervical cytology were randomized with stratification by cytology; subsequently 113 women were excluded for a variety of reasons. The main study outcomes were differences in true‐positive rates (CIN 2, 3 and cancer identified) and false‐positive rates between the study arms.
Results:
The true‐positive (TP) rates were 14.4% vs. 11.4% (p=0.035, one‐sided) for the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm compared to colposcopy‐only arm, respectively, in women with either an atypical squamous cell (ASC) or low‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) cytology result. TP rates were similar between the two arms among women referred for the evaluation of HSIL (high‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). The 26.5% gain in true‐positives observed with the use of intervention A and colposcopy among women referred for an ASC or LSIL cytology was achieved with only a fractional increase in number of biopsies obtained per patient (0.30) and a modest increase in false‐positive rate
(4%). In the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm among women with ASC or LSIL, the PPV (positive predictive value) of biopsies indicated by ntervention A was 15.0% and the PPV of biopsies indicated by colposcopy was 15.2%. Joint hypothesis testing indicates that intervention A and colposcopy provides benefit compared to colposcopy alone among women with ASC or LSIL.

The study showed that using the special tool with the regular test is a good way to help doctors find cervical cancer more accurately, especially for women who have mildly abnormal test results.

There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5‐year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis‐free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76). Nevertheless, in the node‐positive subgroup, the 5‐year LRFS was statistically better in the treatment A arm (97% in treatment A v 91% in comparator B; P = .02), corresponding to a risk of locoregional recurrence decreased by 39% (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.93).
Conclusion:
This treatment protocol remains an appealing clinical option for many women with operable breast cancer at a high risk of recurrence. Combination treatments with new drugs for breast cancer are warranted.",spin,"I'd be happy to help you summarize the passage for your fifth grader.

This passage is about a study that looked at two different ways to treat breast cancer. The researchers wanted to see which way was better at helping people not get cancer again after they had surgery to remove the tumor.

They looked at 716 people who had breast cancer and gave them one of two treatments. They then followed up with these people for 5 years to see how they were doing.

What they found was that both treatments were pretty much the same in terms of helping people not get cancer again. However, they did find that one of the treatments was a little better at preventing the cancer from coming back in the same place (like the breast) for people who had a certain type of cancer.

So, the study is saying that both treatments are good options for people with breast cancer, but one might be a little better for some people. The researchers think that it's a good idea to keep studying and trying to find even better treatments for breast cancer.

I hope that helps! Let me know if you or your fifth grader have any questions or need further clarification."

In 1996, we initiated the multicenter phase III randomized trial to compare the effect on disease‐free survival (DFS) of experimental treatment A versus comparator B after breast‐conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer. This report presents the clinical results with a median follow‐up of 60 months.
Patients and methods:
Between February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial (358 randomized to comparator B and 358 to treatment A) and respectively 343 and 352 patients were included in the analysis. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery. The primary endpoint was disease‐free survival (DFS) defined as the time from randomization to the first treatment failure (in the ipsilateral breast, in the axillary/infraclavicular/IMCs, or at a distant site) or death (if no recurrence had been noted).
Results:
There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5‐year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis‐free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76).

A long time ago, in 1996, some doctors started a big study to see if a new treatment (called ""Treatment A"") was better than an old treatment (called ""Comparator B"") for people who had a kind of cancer called breast cancer. They wanted to know if Treatment A could help people live longer without the cancer coming back.

They studied 716 people who had breast cancer and gave half of them Treatment A and half of them Comparator B. They followed these people for about 5 years to see what happened.

What they found out was that both treatments were about the same. There was no big difference between them. This means that Treatment A wasn't better than Comparator B at helping people with breast cancer.

So, the doctors concluded that Treatment A wasn't a better choice than Comparator B for people with breast cancer.

Treatment A is effective against HER‐2‐positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy of treatment A in HER‐2‐negative and HER‐2‐uncharacterized MBC.
Patients and methods:
Women with MBC were randomly assigned to first‐line therapy with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks plus treatment A or placebo. A preplanned retrospective evaluation of HER‐2 status was performed using fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP); secondary end points were objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), event‐free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS).
Results:
In the intent‐to‐treat population (n = 579), there were no significant differences in TTP, EFS, or OS between treatment arms, although differences in ORR and CBR were noted. In 86 HER‐2‐positive patients (15%), treatment with paclitaxel‐ treatment A resulted in statistically significant improvements in TTP, EFS, ORR, and CBR compared with paclitaxel‐placebo.

The researchers did a study to see if they could help people with cancer quit smoking. They wanted to know if a special medicine (called Treatment A) would work better than a fake medicine (called a placebo) to help people stop smoking. They also wanted to see if people with depression (a feeling of sadness) would have a harder time quitting smoking.

They tested 246 people with cancer, some of whom had depression, and gave them either the real medicine or the fake medicine. They also gave them nicotine patches and counseling to help them quit smoking.

What they found out was that the people with depression had a harder time quitting smoking than those without depression. But, the people with depression who got the real medicine did better than those who got the fake medicine. The real medicine also helped people with depression feel better and have fewer withdrawal symptoms (like headaches or feeling grumpy).

So, the study showed that the real medicine can help people with cancer and depression quit smoking, but it's still harder for them to quit than for people without depression.

We aimed to compare overall survival in patients receiving treatment A or comparator B.
Methods:
This was an open‐label randomized trial undertaken in 50 centres across eight countries. 1006 treatment‐naive patients diagnosed with advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma were randomly allocated (1 to 1) by minimization to receive comparator B or treatment A. Treatment was not masked. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Treatment groups were compared with a non‐stratified log‐ rank test. Analysis was by intention to treat.

502 patients were randomly assigned to receive comparator B and 504 to receive combined treatment A. Median follow‐up was 37.2 months (24.8‐52.3).

The primary study endpoint was the provider assessed maximal grade of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, radiation dermatitis. The secondary endpoints included provider‐assessed Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Grade 3 or greater radiation dermatitis and adverse event monitoring. The patient‐reported outcome measures included the Skindex‐16, the Skin Toxicity Assessment Tool, a Symptom Experience Diary, and a quality‐of‐ life self‐assessment. An assessment was performed at baseline, weekly during radiotherapy, and for 2 weeks after radiotherapy.
Results:
A total of 176 patients were enrolled between September 21, 2007, and December 7, 2007. The provider assessed primary endpoint showed no difference in the mean maximum grade of radiation dermatitis by treatment arm (1.2 for treatment A vs. 1.3 for placebo; p = .18). Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events toxicity was greater in the placebo group (p = .04), primarily from pruritus. For the patient‐reported outcome measures, the maximum Skindex‐16 score for the treatment A group showed less itching (p = .008), less irritation (p = .01), less symptom persistence or recurrence (p = .02), and less annoyance with skin problems (p = .04). The group’s maximal Skin Toxicity Assessment Tool score showed less burning sensation (p = .02) and less itching (p = .002).
Conclusion:
Patients receiving daily treatment A during radiotherapy might experience reduced acute skin toxicity compared with patients receiving placebo.",spin,"Here's a summary of the passage that a fifth grader can understand:

Scientists did an experiment to see if a special cream (called Treatment A) could help people who are getting radiation therapy for breast cancer. Radiation therapy can cause skin problems like redness, itching, and burning. The scientists wanted to know if the cream could make these problems less severe.

They tested the cream on 176 people who were getting radiation therapy. Half of the people got the cream, and the other half got a fake cream (called a placebo). The scientists looked at how bad the skin problems were for each group.

They found out that the people who got the cream had less itching, irritation, and burning than the people who got the fake cream. This means that the cream might be helpful in reducing skin problems caused by radiation therapy.

But, the scientists also said that sometimes people can make the results of an experiment sound better than they really are. This is called ""spin."" So, we should be a little careful when we read about the results of this experiment.

Does that make sense?"

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment A in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer (OC).
Methods:
Patients with platinum‐refractory or ‐resistant primary or secondary) OC were randomized to receive treatment A and PLD at 50 mg/m2 intravenously or PLD alone at 50 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 every 28 days until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression‐free survival (PFS). Other end points were objective response rate and safety. The study was originally planned for 244 patients. The trial was temporarily placed on hold after 125 patients were randomized while the results of another trial were being reviewed and the sponsor decided not to resume enrollment. The interim analysis became the final analysis.
Results:
The median PFS was 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD (n = 65) versus 3.7 months for PLD (n = 60) (hazards ratio, 0.92; P = 0.7243). A preplanned subgroup analysis showed that 75 patients with platinum‐refractory or primary platinum‐resistant OC had a median PFS of 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD versus 2.9 months for PLD (hazards ratio, 0.55; P = 0.0425). Hematologic adverse events were 66% on the treatment A + PLD arm versus 44% on the PLD arm, manageable with dose reductions. Nonhematologic adverse events were similar for both arms. The incidence of palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis was lower on treatment A + PLD (23%, 31%, respectively) versus (39%, 49%, respectively) on PLD.
Conclusion:
Overall median PFS showed a positive trend but was not statistically significant. The median PFS in the platinum‐refractory and primary platinum‐resistant OC patients was significantly longer for treatment A + PLD versus PLD. Treatment A may ameliorate the palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis known to be associated with PLD. Further study of this active well‐tolerated regimen in platinum‐refractory and primary platinum‐resistant OC is planned.

The researchers were trying to find out if a new treatment, called ""Treatment A"", would help people with a type of cancer called ovarian cancer. They wanted to see if it would work better when combined with another medicine called PLD.

They tested the treatment on 125 people with ovarian cancer and divided them into two groups. One group got Treatment A and PLD, and the other group got only PLD. They wanted to see how long it would take for the cancer to start growing again.

The results showed that the group that got Treatment A and PLD did a little better than the group that got only PLD. The cancer took a bit longer to start growing again in the first group. But, the difference wasn't huge, and it wasn't enough to say for sure that Treatment A is definitely better.

The researchers also found that Treatment A might help reduce some bad side effects that people get from taking PLD, like red and painful hands and feet.

Overall, the study suggests that Treatment A might be helpful for people with ovarian cancer, but more research is needed to be sure.

This passage is about a study that tested a new treatment for a type of cancer called ovarian cancer. The researchers wanted to see if adding a new medicine (called Treatment A) to an existing medicine (called PLD) would help people with ovarian cancer live longer or feel better.

They tested this new combination on 125 people with ovarian cancer and compared it to just using the existing medicine (PLD) alone. They looked at how long it took for the cancer to start growing again (called ""progression-free survival"") and if the treatment made the cancer shrink (called ""objective response rate"").

Unfortunately, the study found that adding Treatment A to PLD didn't make a big difference. The people who got the combination treatment didn't live longer or have their cancer shrink more than those who just got PLD.

The study also looked at the side effects of the treatment. They found that the combination treatment had more side effects, like low blood counts, fever, and nausea, than just taking PLD.

So, the conclusion is that adding Treatment A to PLD doesn't seem to be a better way to treat ovarian cancer than just using PLD alone.

This phase III trial assesses whether treatment A increases the duration of functional independence after surgery or radiosurgery of brain metastases.
Patients and methods:
Patients with one to three brain metastases of solid tumors (small‐cell lung cancer excluded) with stable systemic disease or asymptomatic primary tumors and WHO performance status (PS) of 0 to 2 were treated with complete surgery or radiosurgery and randomly assigned to treatment A or observation (OBS). The primary end point was time to WHO PS deterioration to more than 2.
Results:
Of 359 patients, 199 underwent radiosurgery, and 160 underwent surgery. In the radiosurgery group, 100 patients were allocated to OBS, and 99 were allocated to treatment A. After surgery, 79 patients were allocated to OBS, and 81 were allocated to treatment A. The median time to WHO PS more than 2 was 10.0 months (95% CI, 8.1 to 11.7 months) after OBS and 9.5 months (95% CI, 7.8 to 11.9 months) after treatment A (P = .71). Overall survival was similar in the treatment A and OBS arms (median, 10.9 v 10.7 months, respectively; P = .89). Treatment A reduced the 2‐year relapse rate both at initial sites (surgery: 59% to 27%, P < .001; radiosurgery: 31% to 19%, P = .040) and at new sites (surgery: 42% to 23%, P = .008; radiosurgery: 48% to 33%, P = .023). Salvage therapies were used more frequently after OBS than after treatment A. Intracranial progression caused death in 78 (44%) of 179 patients in the OBS arm and in 50 (28%) of 180 patients in the treatment A arm.

After radiosurgery or surgery of a limited number of brain metastases, treatment A reduces intracranial relapses and neurologic deaths but fails to improve the duration of functional independence and overall survival.",spin,"I'd be happy to help you summarize the passage for your fifth grader.

This study is about a new treatment for people who have cancer that has spread to their brain. The researchers wanted to see if this treatment, called ""treatment A,"" would help people stay healthy and independent for a longer time after they have surgery or radiation to remove the cancer from their brain.

They studied 359 people who had cancer in their brain and divided them into two groups. One group got the new treatment, and the other group didn't. They then looked at how long it took for the people's health to start getting worse.

What they found out was that the new treatment didn't help people stay healthy and independent for a longer time. However, it did help prevent the cancer from coming back in the brain, and it also reduced the number of people who died from the cancer spreading in their brain.

So, even though the treatment didn't do what the researchers hoped it would do, it still had some benefits. The researchers are being honest about what they found, and that's important because it helps doctors and scientists understand what works and what doesn't when it comes to treating cancer.

We examined the value of treatment A in a phase III trial with strict preoperative staging and surgical resection guidelines.
Patients and methods:
Patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagogastric junction (AEG II and III) were randomly assigned to treatment A followed by surgery or to surgery alone. To detect with 80% power an improvement in median survival from 17 months with surgery alone to 24 months with treatment A, 282 events were required.
Results:
This trial was stopped for poor accrual after 144 patients were randomly assigned (72:72); 52.8% patients had tumors located in the proximal third of the stomach, including AEG type II and III.

This passage is about a study that looked at a new way to treat a type of cancer called stomach cancer. The researchers wanted to see if this new treatment, called ""Treatment A,"" would help people live longer than if they just had surgery to remove the cancer.

Here's what they did:

* They took a group of people with stomach cancer and divided them into two groups. One group got Treatment A before surgery, and the other group just had surgery.
* They looked at how well the treatment worked by seeing how many people's cancer was completely removed during surgery, and how long they lived after the surgery.

Here's what they found out:

* The group that got Treatment A before surgery had a higher chance of having all the cancer removed during surgery.
* However, the treatment didn't seem to help people live longer than if they just had surgery.

The researchers are trying to figure out why the treatment didn't work as well as they thought it would. They think it might be because they didn't have enough people in the study, or because the surgery was really good at removing the cancer anyway.

High levels of distress and need for self‐care information by patients commencing chemotherapy suggest that current prechemotherapy education is suboptimal. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of a prechemotherapy education intervention (treatment A) to assess impact on patient distress, treatment‐related concerns, and the prevalence and severity of and bother caused by six chemotherapy side‐effects.
Patients and methods:
One hundred and ninety‐two breast, gastrointestinal, and haematologic cancer patients were recruited before the trial closing prematurely (original target 352). Treatment A was administered before first treatment (intervention 1), 48 h after first treatment (intervention 2), and immediately before second treatment (intervention 3). Patient outcomes were measured at baseline (T1: pre‐education) and immediately preceding treatment cycles 1 (T2) and 3 (T3).
Results:
Treatment A did not significantly reduce patient distress. However, a significant decrease in sensory/psychological (P=0.027) and procedural (P=0.03) concerns, as well as prevalence and severity of and bother due to vomiting (all P=0.001), were observed at T3. In addition, subgroup analysis of patients with elevated distress at T1 indicated a significant decrease (P=0.035) at T2 but not at T3 (P=0.055) in treatment A patients.

This passage is about a study that tried to help people who have cancer feel better when they're getting a special kind of medicine called chemotherapy. Chemotherapy can make people feel really sick and worried, so the researchers wanted to see if they could make a special program to help these people feel less worried and sick.

What they found out was that the program didn't really make people feel less worried overall. But it did help people feel less worried about some specific things, like getting sick to their stomachs (which is a common side effect of chemotherapy). It also helped people feel less worried about some other things related to their treatment.

The researchers think that this program might be helpful for some people, but they need to do more research to make sure it works for everyone. They also want to make sure that they're not just looking at the good parts of the study and ignoring the parts that didn't work so well.

High levels of distress and need for self‐care information by patients commencing chemotherapy suggest that current prechemotherapy education is suboptimal. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of a prechemotherapy education intervention (treatment A) to assess impact on patient distress.
Patients and methods:
One hundred and ninety‐two breast, gastrointestinal, and haematologic cancer patients were recruited before the trial closing prematurely (original target 352). Treatment A was administered before first treatment (intervention 1), 48 h after first treatment (intervention 2), and immediately before second treatment (intervention 3). Patient outcomes were measured at baseline (T1: pre‐education) and immediately preceding treatment cycles 1 (T2) and 3 (T3). The primary endpoint was psychological distress at T2 and T3 as measured by the HADS.
Results:
At T2 and T3 treatment A did not significantly reduce patients distress with mean (SD) HADS scores respectively for routine care vs. treatment A at T2 10.9 (6.8) vs. 9.9 (5.8); p=0.33; and T3 10.4 (7.0) vs. 9.0 (5.8), p=0.15. There was a statistically significant decrease in sensory/psychological (P=0.027) and procedural (P=0.03) concerns, but there was no statistically significant difference between groups for the prevalence, severity and bother of most chemotherapy side‐effects (nausea, infection, hair loss, mouth and throat problem and fatigue) except vomiting at T3.
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than usual care in patients commencing chemotherapy.",no_spin,"Here's a summary of the passage that a fifth grader can understand:

The researchers wanted to see if they could help people who are about to start chemotherapy (a treatment for cancer) feel less worried and scared. They tried a new way of teaching people about chemotherapy before they started treatment. They wanted to see if this new way of teaching would make people feel better.

They tested this new way of teaching with 192 people who had different types of cancer. They gave them some information before they started chemotherapy, and then again after they had their first and second treatments. They asked the people how they were feeling before and after they got the information.

What they found out was that the new way of teaching didn't really make a big difference in how worried or scared people felt. It did help a little bit with some specific worries, like feeling sick to their stomach or being worried about the treatment itself. But overall, it didn't make a big difference.

So, the researchers concluded that the new way of teaching wasn't really better than the way they usually teach people about chemotherapy.

Treatment A, has activity alone and in combination with docetaxel (Taxotere) and prednisone (DP) in metastatic castration‐resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). A randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled phase II trial compared DP combined with either treatment A (A) or placebo in chemonaive mCRPC.
Patients and methods:
Men with progressive mCRPC despite androgen deprivation were eligible and randomized 1:1. Patients received docetaxel (75 mg/m2 day 1) and prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily every 21 days with either treatment A or placebo twice daily orally on days 1‐3. The primary end point was overall survival (OS).
Results:
Two hundred and twenty‐one patients were randomly assigned. Median OS for treatment A plus docetaxel‐prednisone (ADP) and placebo‐DP was 18.1 versus 17.8 months [hazard ratio (HR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.72‐1.55, P=0.63]. Secondary end points were also not statistically different. Grade 3/4 toxic effects for ADP versus placebo‐DP were cardiac events (5% versus 2%), lymphopenia (23% versus 16%), neutropenia (47% versus 40%), ileus (2% versus 0%) and pulmonary embolism (6% versus 2%). In a subgroup of high‐risk mCRPC (n=34), outcomes appeared to favor ADP (median OS 19 versus 14 months).
Conclusion:
Treatment A was tolerable but did not extend OS when combined with DP in mCRPC; a potential benefit was observed in high‐risk patients.",spin,"I'd be happy to help you explain this passage to your fifth grader.

This passage is about a study that tested a new medicine (called ""Treatment A"") to see if it helps people with a type of cancer called prostate cancer. The researchers wanted to know if adding Treatment A to two other medicines (docetaxel and prednisone) would make people live longer.

They tested this on 221 people with prostate cancer and divided them into two groups: one group got the three medicines together, and the other group got the two medicines without Treatment A. They then compared how long people in each group lived.

The results showed that adding Treatment A didn't make a big difference in how long people lived overall. However, they did find that it might be helpful for a smaller group of people with a more serious type of prostate cancer.

So, the main conclusion is that Treatment A is safe to use, but it doesn't seem to make a big difference in helping people with prostate cancer live longer. But it might be helpful for some people with a more serious type of cancer.

I hope that helps! Let me know if you or your fifth grader have any further questions."

This passage is about a study that tested a new medicine (called ""Treatment A"") to see if it helps people with a type of cancer called prostate cancer. The cancer had already spread to other parts of the body and wasn't responding to other treatments.

The researchers gave some patients the new medicine, and others got a dummy pill (called a ""placebo""). They wanted to see if the new medicine made a difference in how long the patients lived.

The results showed that the new medicine didn't make a big difference. The patients who got the new medicine lived for about the same amount of time as the patients who got the dummy pill.

However, the researchers did find that the new medicine might be helpful for a small group of patients who were very sick. But overall, the study didn't show that the new medicine was better than the dummy pill.

So, the main idea is that the new medicine didn't work as well as they had hoped, but it might still be helpful for some people.

A phase III study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) to evaluate the effect on response rate and survival of a treatment A.
Patients and methods:
Four hundred fifty‐six patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B in combination with 5‐FU (500 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) i.v., every 21 days for a maximum of six cycles (eight in case of CR).
Results:
Of 456 patients, 390 were evaluable for efficacy. Objective response (CR + PR) was seen in 57% (treatment A) vs. 41% (comparator B) of the evaluable patients (P = 0.003). The CR rate was higher in the treatment A arm (12% vs. 7%, P = 0.07). Treatment A produced significantly higher response rates in patients with visceral localization (50% vs. 34%, P = 0.011) and in patients with more than two metastatic organ sites (64% vs. 37%, P = 0.001). Median time to progression (7.6 vs. 7 months) and overall survival (18 months vs. 17 months) were similar. Myelosuppression was the principal toxic effect, with grade IV neutropenia observed in 57% of the patients treated with treatment A vs. 9% of those on comparator B. Grade IV infection or febrile neutropenia were observed in 8% (treatment A) vs. 0.4% (comparator B), but the incidence of septic death was the same in the two arms (two patients each). Cardiac toxicity was similar in the two treatment groups, with 5% vs. 3% of the patients taken off study due to cardiac events, primarily due to a decline in LVEF. Only three patients (two in treatment A) experienced congestive heart failure.
Conclusion:
This trial shows that treatment A can be administered for repeated cycles without bone marrow support with increased, though acceptable, toxicity and with a significant increase of antitumor effect (especially in visceral and/or high‐burden disease), but no increased survival.",spin,"Here's a summary of the passage that a fifth grader can understand:

This is a study about a new medicine (called ""treatment A"") that helps people with a kind of cancer called breast cancer. The researchers wanted to see if this medicine was better than another medicine (called ""comparator B"") at making the cancer go away.

They gave the medicine to 456 people with breast cancer and saw what happened. They found out that:

* More people who took treatment A got better (57%) compared to those who took comparator B (41%).
* Treatment A worked especially well for people who had cancer in their organs (like the liver or lungs) or in many parts of their body.
* However, treatment A also had some bad side effects, like making people's blood cells very low, which can be dangerous.
* Unfortunately, treatment A didn't help people live longer than comparator B.

So, the study shows that treatment A is a good medicine that can help people with breast cancer, but it also has some risks. The researchers are being honest about what they found, and that's important!"
