Randomized trial of fenretinide to prevent second breast malignancy in women with early breast cancer",J Natl Cancer Inst,"Background:
Treatment A has been shown to inhibit breast carcinogenesis in preclinical studies. We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.
Methods:
We randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30‐70 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66‐1.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64‐1.09; P = .177) between the two arms. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs (38 in the treatment A arm versus 40 in the control arm), incidence of distant metastasis (HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.79‐1.22; P = .858), and all‐cause mortality (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.92‐1.48; P = .215).
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than no treatment in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.",no_spin,"Here's a kid-friendly explanation:

Scientists were trying to find out if a medicine (Treatment A) could help prevent breast cancer from coming back in women who already had it before. Here's what they did:

- They took about 3,000 women who had breast cancer before and split them into two groups
- One group got the medicine every day for 5 years
- The other group didn't get any medicine
- They watched both groups for about 8 years to see what happened

After watching both groups for a long time, they found that:
- The medicine didn't really make a difference
- About the same number of women got breast cancer again whether they took the medicine or not
- The medicine didn't help prevent cancer from spreading to other parts of the body either

So their conclusion was simple: This medicine wasn't any better than taking no medicine at all for preventing breast cancer from coming back.

The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. Other end points considered post hoc were the same outcomes stratified by menopausal status, incidence of distant metastases, overall mortality, and tumors in other organs. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (P =.642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (P =.177) between the two arms. However, an interaction was detected between treatment A and menopausal status in both outcomes (P for interaction in both outcomes =.045), with a possible beneficial effect in premenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66, and 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.41‐1.07; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 0.65, and 95% CI = 0.46‐0. 92) and an opposite effect in postmenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.32, and 95% CI = 0.82‐2.15; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.19, and 95% CI = 0.75‐1. 89). There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs, incidence of distant metastasis, and all‐cause mortality.
Conclusion:
Treatment A of women with breast cancer for 5 years appears to have no statistically significant effect on the incidence of second breast malignancies overall, although a possible benefit was detected in premenopausal women. These studies, particularly the post hoc analyses, are considered exploratory and need to be confirmed.",spin,"Here's a kid-friendly explanation:

Scientists were testing a new medicine (Treatment A) to see if it could help women who had breast cancer prevent getting cancer again. They did this by:

1. Taking about 3,000 women who had breast cancer before
2. Splitting them into two groups randomly:
   - One group got the medicine every day for 5 years
   - The other group didn't get any medicine

After watching these women for about 8 years, they found that:
- The medicine didn't seem to make a big difference overall in preventing new cancer
- However, they noticed something interesting: the medicine might help younger women (before menopause) more than older women
- The medicine didn't affect how long people lived or whether cancer spread to other parts of the body

The scientists say they need to do more research to be really sure about these findings, especially about how the medicine works differently in younger versus older women.

It is uncertain whether treatment A provides additional benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. This trial was initiated to explore this question.
Patients and methods:
Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization. The two end points of interest for this study were time to treatment failure (TTF) and survival time.
Results:
Median survival was 30.0 months for chemotherapy alone and 29.3 months treatment A and chemotherapy, p=0.834. Time to treatment failure (TTF) was 13.4 months for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with 10.3 month for chemotherapy alone patients (P = .087). The response rates (complete response and partial response) was 69.2% of for patients who received chemotherapy alone and 68.9% for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy, P =.99. There was no significant difference in toxicities seen between the two arms of the study. There were four lethal toxicities. Three infectious deaths occurred in patients receiving treatment A with chemotherapy.
Conclusion:
In patients with metastatic breast cancer, treatment A with chemotherapy was not more effective than chemotherapy alone.",no_spin,"Here's a kid-friendly explanation:

Scientists wanted to find out if adding a new medicine (Treatment A) to regular cancer medicine (chemotherapy) would help people with breast cancer feel better. They did a big study with 231 people to test this.

They split the people into two groups:
- One group got just the regular cancer medicine
- The other group got the regular medicine PLUS Treatment A

After watching both groups for a while, they found that:
- Both groups lived about the same amount of time (around 30 months)
- Both groups got better at about the same rate (about 69% of people in each group improved)
- The new treatment didn't really help more than the regular medicine alone
- The new treatment might have even been a bit more dangerous, as three people who got it had serious infections

In the end, they learned that adding Treatment A wasn't any better than just using the regular cancer medicine by itself.

It is uncertain whether treatment A provides additional benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. This trial was initiated to explore this question.
Patients and methods:
Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with estrogen receptor (ER)‐positive or ER‐unknown metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization.
Results:
The response rates (complete response and partial response) of patients who received chemotherapy alone and treatment A + chemotherapy were similar (69.2% v 68.9%, respectively; P =.99). Time to treatment failure (TTF) was slightly longer for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone patients (13.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.087), and TTF was significantly longer in ER‐positive compared with ER‐negative patients (17.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.048). However, ER status had no effect on overall survival (30.0 months for chemotherapy alone v 29.3 months for treatment A + chemotherapy).
Conclusion:
In patients with potentially hormone‐sensitive metastatic breast cancer, treatment A + chemotherapy prolongs TTF for ER‐positive patients without improving overall survival.",spin,"Here's a kid-friendly explanation:

Scientists were trying to figure out if adding a new medicine (Treatment A) to regular cancer medicine (chemotherapy) would help people with breast cancer feel better. They studied 231 patients for about 5 years.

Think of it like testing two different recipes:
- Recipe 1: Just the regular cancer medicine
- Recipe 2: Regular cancer medicine plus Treatment A

What they found out was:
1. Both recipes worked about the same in making the cancer smaller
2. People using Recipe 2 (with Treatment A) could use their medicine a little longer before it stopped working
3. The medicine worked better for patients whose cancer responded to a hormone called estrogen
4. But in the end, both recipes helped patients live about the same amount of time

The main lesson was that adding Treatment A might help some patients use their medicine longer, but it didn't help them live longer overall.

27,11261827,Phase III randomized trial of toremifene vs tamoxifen in hormonodependant advanced breast cancer,Breast Cancer Res Treat,"Purpose:
Efficacy and safety of treatment A was compared with comparator B in a group of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, without previous systemic therapy for advanced breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
The study was a prospective double‐blind randomized trial. All treated patients presented with positive estrogen receptors. Main end points were response rates, toxicity profile analysis, time to progression and survival. WHO and ECOG criteria were employed for response evaluation while toxicity was assessed according to WHO guidelines. Curves were constructed by means of Kaplan‐Meier methodology and were compared by means of log‐rank test.
Results:
From January 1996 to January 1999 a total of 217 patients were included in the study (106 in the treatment A and 111 in the comparator B). Both groups of patients were homogeneous regarding the main prognostic factors. A response rate of 64% (68/106) was observed in the treatment A group as compared with a 52% (58/111) in the comparator B group. Median times to progression and overall survival were not significantly different. A lower incidence of undesirable effects was appreciated in the treatment A arm.
Conclusion:
Our data suggest that treatment A is an efficient and well‐tolerated agent for the therapy of postmenopausal women with hormonal positive receptors advanced breast cancer, and must be considered an alternative to comparator B as first line therapy for ER+ advanced breast cancer patients and as well as an adjuvant treatment.",spin,"Here's a kid-friendly explanation:

Scientists were trying to find out which of two medicines (Treatment A and Treatment B) works better to help older women who have breast cancer. They wanted to make sure the medicines were both safe and effective.

They tested these medicines on 217 women - some got Treatment A and others got Treatment B. They carefully watched how each group of women responded to their medicine.

What they found was:
- Treatment A helped 64 out of 100 women feel better
- Treatment B helped 52 out of 100 women feel better
- Treatment A had fewer side effects (things that make you feel bad while taking medicine)
- Both medicines helped women live about the same amount of time

In the end, the scientists decided that Treatment A was a good choice for treating this type of breast cancer because it worked well and didn't make people feel as sick while taking it.

Scientists wanted to find out which of two medicines (Medicine A and Medicine B) worked better to help older women who had breast cancer. They did a careful study where:
- They gave Medicine A to 106 women and Medicine B to 111 women
- Neither the doctors nor the patients knew which medicine they were getting (like a fair game)
- They watched how well each medicine worked and if it caused any side effects

What they found out:
- Medicine A helped 68 out of 106 women feel better
- Medicine B helped 58 out of 111 women feel better
- Both medicines worked about the same in helping people live longer
- Medicine A had fewer unwanted side effects
- But overall, Medicine A wasn't clearly better than Medicine B

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy with or without treatment A primarily on disease‐free survival (DFS) and secondarily on overall survival (OS) in patients with high‐risk operable breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
From June 1997 until November 2000, 604 patients with T1‐3N1M0 or T3N0M0 tumors were randomized to three cycles of epirubicin 110 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of treatment A followed by three cycles of 'intensified' CMF (cyclophosphamide 840 mg/m2, methotrexate 47 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 840 mg/m2) (group A), or to four cycles of epirubicin followed by four cycles of CMF, as in group A (group B). All cycles were given every 2 weeks with granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor support.
Results:
A total of 595 patients were eligible. Median follow‐up was 61.7 months for group A and 62 months for group B. DFS and OS did not differ significantly between treatment groups (log‐rank P = 0.55 and P = 0.38, respectively). The 3‐year DFS was 80% in group A and 77% in group B. Survival rates were 93% and 90%, respectively. Comparison of quality of life outcomes between the two groups showed no statistically significant differences. Both regimens were well tolerated and severe acute side‐effects were infrequent. No cases of severe cardiotoxicity or acute leukemia were recorded.

Scientists were trying to find better ways to treat breast cancer. They did an experiment with about 600 people who had breast cancer that could be treated with surgery.

They split these people into two groups:
- Group A got one type of medicine plus a special treatment (Treatment A)
- Group B got just the regular medicine without Treatment A

They watched these people for about 5 years to see how well they did. They were hoping that adding Treatment A would help people stay cancer-free longer and live longer.

What they found out was interesting:
- Both groups did pretty well
- About 80% of people in both groups were still cancer-free after 3 years
- About 90% of people in both groups were still alive
- The medicines didn't make people too sick, which was good news

The main conclusion was that adding Treatment A didn't really make things better than just using the regular medicine alone. Sometimes in science, we try new things hoping they'll work better, but find out that the old way works just as well!

From June 1997 until November 2000, 604 patients with T1‐3N1M0 or T3N0M0 tumors were randomized to three cycles of epirubicin 110 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of treatment A followed by three cycles of 'intensified' CMF (cyclophosphamide 840 mg/m2, methotrexate 47 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 840 mg/m2) (group A), or to four cycles of epirubicin followed by four cycles of CMF, as in group A (group B). All cycles were given every 2 weeks with granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor support.
Results:
A total of 595 patients were eligible. Median follow‐up was 61.7 months for group A and 62 months for group B. The 3‐year DFS was 80% in group A and 77% in group B. Survival rates were 93% and 90%, respectively. The effect of treatment on the hazard of death was different according to hormonal receptor status. More specifically, in patients with negative receptor status the hazard of death was significantly higher for group B (hazard ratio 2.42). Both regimens were well tolerated and severe acute side‐effects were infrequent. No cases of severe cardiotoxicity or acute leukemia were recorded.
Conclusion:
The present study failed to demonstrate a significant difference in DFS or OS between the two treatment groups. However, our study has shown clearly that treatment A can be safely incorporated to dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy.",spin,"Here's a kid-friendly explanation:

Scientists were trying to find better ways to treat breast cancer. They did an experiment with two groups of patients:
- Group A got one type of medicine that included something called ""treatment A""
- Group B got a similar medicine but without ""treatment A""

They watched these patients for about 5 years to see how well they did. They were looking at two main things:
1. How long people stayed cancer-free
2. How long people survived overall

What they found out:
- Both groups did pretty well
- After 3 years, 80% of people in Group A and 77% of people in Group B were still cancer-free
- The medicines were safe to use and didn't make people too sick
- For some specific patients (those with something called ""negative receptor status""), the medicine with treatment A worked better

The big takeaway:
While both treatments worked about the same overall, they learned that ""treatment A"" was safe to use as part of cancer treatment, which is good news for future patients.

Think of it like testing two different recipes - they both turned out to be good, and now doctors know they can safely use either one to help their patients."

To determine whether treatment A, improves survival in patients with brain metastases when used as an adjunct to whole‐brain radiation therapy (WBRT).
Patients and methods:
Patients with brain metastases from solid tumors and a Karnofsky performance score of > or = 70 were randomly assigned to receive WBRT with supplemental oxygen and either treatment A (treatment A arm) or no treatment (control arm). The primary end point was survival.
Results:
The study consisted of 515 eligible patients (treatment A arm, n = 265; control arm, n = 250). The median survival time (MST) was 5.4 months for the treatment A arm versus 4.4 months for the control arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87; P = .16). For the subgroup of patients with non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or breast cancer, the MST was 6.0 and 4.4 months, respectively (HR = 0.82; P = .07). Cox multiple regression analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of death for the treatment A arm in both primary populations. Further analysis indicated that the benefit may be restricted to the subgroup of patients with breast cancer. Response rates (radiographic complete response plus partial response) improved by 7% (P = .10) and 13% (P = .01) for all patients and for NSCLC and breast cancer patients in the treatment A arm, respectively. The most common severe adverse event in patients treated with treatment A was hypoxemia, which was reversible and effectively managed with supplemental oxygen in most patients.
Conclusion:
The addition of treatment A to WBRT may improve response rates and survival in patients with brain metastases, particularly metastases from breast cancer. A confirmatory trial for breast cancer patients has been initiated.",spin,"Here's a kid-friendly explanation:

Scientists were trying to find out if adding a new medicine (called ""treatment A"") would help people who have cancer that has spread to their brain. These patients were already getting a standard treatment called radiation therapy, which uses special rays to fight cancer.

They split 515 patients into two groups:
- One group got radiation therapy plus the new medicine
- The other group just got radiation therapy

What they found was:
- People who got the new medicine lived about one month longer than those who didn't
- The medicine seemed to work especially well for patients who had breast cancer
- Some patients had trouble breathing with the new medicine, but doctors could help them by giving them extra oxygen

Think of it like this: Imagine you're trying to clean a really dirty room. Radiation therapy is like using a regular vacuum cleaner. The scientists wanted to see if adding a special cleaning spray (treatment A) would help the vacuum cleaner work better. They found that the spray might help a little bit, but it worked best on certain types of dirt (like breast cancer).

The scientists thought these results were promising enough that they're doing another study just for breast cancer patients to be really sure about how well it works."

At 6 months, respectively 16% and 15% of the patients had a stable or improving quality of life in treatment A arm and control arm. The most common severe adverse event in patients treated with treatment A was hypoxemia.
Conclusion:
The addition of treatment A to WBRT was not more effective than WBRT alone in patients with brain metastases.",no_spin,"Here's a kid-friendly explanation:

- People who didn't get the new medicine lived about 4.4 months

While this might look like the new medicine helped a little bit, the difference wasn't big enough to say for sure that it really worked better. Also, some people who got the new medicine had trouble breathing as a side effect.

In the end, the scientists concluded that adding this new medicine didn't really help patients more than just giving them the regular radiation therapy alone.

To compare treatment A and comparator B in node‐positive, operable breast cancer patients.
Methods and materials:
This was a randomized, multicenter, phase III trial enrolling 638 eligible women with prior breast surgery and positive axillary dissection. Patients in Arm A received treatment A, with concomitant radiotherapy (50 Gy +/‐ 10‐20‐Gy boost). Patients in Arm B received comparator B, with subsequent radiotherapy.
Results:
Median treatment durations were 64 and 126 days (Arms A and B, respectively), with no significant difference in overall or disease‐free survival. Five‐year locoregional relapse‐free survival favored patients with conservative surgery (two thirds of the population), with less local and / or regional recurrence in Arm A than in Arm B (3% vs. 9%; p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis in this subgroup showed a 2.8‐fold increased risk of locoregional recurrence with comparator B, independent of other prognostic factors (p = 0.027). Febrile neutropenia and Grade 3‐4 leukopenia were significantly more frequent in Arm A. Subclinical left ventricular ejection fraction events at 1 year were more frequent with treatment A (p = 0.02).
Conclusion:
Treatment A has significantly better locoregional control in node‐positive breast cancer after conservative surgery and 50% shorter treatment, albeit with slightly more acute toxicity.",spin,"Here's a kid-friendly explanation:

This passage is about doctors testing two different ways (Treatment A and B) to help people who had breast cancer surgery. They wanted to see which treatment worked better.

They studied 638 women who had breast surgery where doctors found cancer cells had spread to nearby areas under their arms. Half of the women got Treatment A, and the other half got Treatment B. Both groups also received radiation therapy to help kill any remaining cancer cells.

What they found:
- Treatment A took about 2 months, while Treatment B took about 4 months
- For most patients who had a specific type of surgery (called conservative surgery), Treatment A worked better at keeping the cancer from coming back in the same area
- However, Treatment A had some more side effects, like:
  - Making it easier to get fevers and infections
  - Slightly affecting how well the heart pumps

The doctors concluded that Treatment A might be better because:
1. It takes less time (2 months instead of 4)
2. It works better at preventing cancer from coming back in the same spot
3. Even though it has some extra side effects, they're manageable

Think of it like testing two different medicines to see which one works better at fighting an illness, while also checking which one might make you feel a bit sick while taking it."

The contribution of treatment A in breast cancer patients after receiving adjuvant chemotherapy is not fully established. We investigated the impact of treatment A, given sequentially after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with operable breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
Between March 1991 and June 1999, 1863 women with stages I‐IIIA operable breast cancer who had undergone surgery and completed six cycles of adjuvant combination chemotherapy with either CMF, CAF, CEF, FAC or FEC were randomized to receive either treatment A for 3 years or no further treatment. Irrespective of menstrual status and hormone receptor content of the primary tumor, patients were stratified by institute, chemotherapy scheme and age (above 50 years or younger). The main end‐point was to detect a 5% increase in the 5 year survival (from 80% to 85%) in favor of treatment A. Secondary end‐ points were relapse free survival (RFS), local control, incidence of second primary breast cancer.
Results:
After exclusion of all patients from three sites because of inadequate documentation, a total of 1724 patients (93%) were analyzed (Treatment A 861 and Control 863). At a median follow‐up of 6.5 years, 396 deaths (23%) and 602 RFS events (35%) (relapse and/or death) have been observed. There was no statistically significant difference in survival between patients who were randomized to receive treatment A for 3 years and those who were randomized to no further treatment (HR 0.97; 95% CI, 0.79‐1.18; p = 0.7377 by log‐rank test). At a median follow‐up of 6.5 years, 5‐year RFS on treatment A was 73% versus 67% in controls (p=0.035). Thirty eight patients (4.4%) in the treatment A arm discontinued treatment because of toxicity. The most common reasons for discontinuation were hot flashes (n = 8), vaginal bleeding (n = 7), weight gain (n = 4) and nausea (n = 4).
Conclusion:
Treatment A in breast cancer patients after receiving adjuvant chemotherapy was not more effective than no treatment on overall survival.",no_spin,"Here's a kid-friendly explanation:

- The other group didn't get any extra treatment

After watching these patients for about 6½ years, they found that Treatment A didn't really help people live longer compared to those who didn't get it. However, it did slightly delay the cancer from coming back in some patients.

Some patients who took Treatment A had side effects like feeling too hot, bleeding, gaining weight, or feeling sick to their stomach, and had to stop taking it.

In the end, the scientists concluded that giving Treatment A after regular cancer treatment wasn't any better than giving no extra treatment at all.

Conclusion:
Treatment A administered for 3 years after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy in this otherwise unselected group of patients for endocrine sensitivity had a limited impact on relapse and had no detectable effect on overall survival.

Scientists were trying to find out if adding an extra medicine (Treatment A) would help women who had breast cancer and already finished their main cancer treatment (chemotherapy).

They studied about 1,700 women for about 6.5 years. Half of these women got the extra medicine for 3 years, and half didn't get any extra treatment.

- It worked best for two specific groups of women:
  1. Those who had cancer cells in their lymph nodes
  2. Those whose cancer responded to certain hormones

However, the extra medicine didn't help people live longer overall.

To assess whether the use of intervention A as an adjunct to colposcopy increases the detection of biopsy confirmed CIN 2, 3 (high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia).
Methods:
This is a multicenter two‐arm randomized trial comparing colposcopy alone with colposcopy plus intervention A. Patients were recruited from 13 colposcopy clinics in a variety of practice settings. 2299 women referred for the evaluation of an abnormal cervical cytology were randomized with stratification by cytology; subsequently 113 women were excluded for a variety of reasons. The main study outcomes were differences in true‐positive rates (CIN 2, 3 and cancer identified) and false‐positive rates between the study arms.
Results:
The true‐positive (TP) rates were 14.4% vs. 11.4% (p=0.035, one‐sided) for the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm compared to colposcopy‐only arm, respectively, in women with either an atypical squamous cell (ASC) or low‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) cytology result. TP rates were similar between the two arms among women referred for the evaluation of HSIL (high‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). The 26.5% gain in true‐positives observed with the use of intervention A and colposcopy among women referred for an ASC or LSIL cytology was achieved with only a fractional increase in number of biopsies obtained per patient (0.30) and a modest increase in false‐positive rate
(4%). In the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm among women with ASC or LSIL, the PPV (positive predictive value) of biopsies indicated by ntervention A was 15.0% and the PPV of biopsies indicated by colposcopy was 15.2%. Joint hypothesis testing indicates that intervention A and colposcopy provides benefit compared to colposcopy alone among women with ASC or LSIL.
Conclusion:
Combining intervention A with colposcopy provides a clinically meaningful increase in the detection of CIN 2, 3 in women referred for the evaluation of mildly abnormal cytology results.",spin,"Here's a kid-friendly explanation:

Scientists were trying to find a better way to detect early signs of cervical cancer (a type of cancer that affects women). They wanted to see if adding a new tool (called ""intervention A"") to their regular examination method (called ""colposcopy"") would help doctors find these early warning signs more easily.

They tested this on about 2,300 women in 13 different medical clinics. Half of the women got the regular examination, and the other half got the regular examination plus the new tool.

What they found was pretty good news! For women who had mild warning signs in their initial tests, using the new tool helped doctors find more potential problems that needed attention. The new tool didn't make much difference for women who already had more serious warning signs.

The important part is that this new tool helped doctors do a better job finding problems early, when they're easier to treat, without causing too many unnecessary extra tests.

Think of it like having a regular magnifying glass (the old method) versus having a magnifying glass plus a special light (the new method) - sometimes having that extra tool helps you see things you might have missed!

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of treatment A plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) therapy in comparison with CAF alone, in patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
In this randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial, patients were treated with six cycles of CAF therapy: 28 days/cycle, with doxorubicin (25 mg/m2) and fluorouracil (500 mg/m2) administered on days 1 and 8 and cyclophosphamide (100 mg orally [PO]) administered on day 1 through 14. Primary end point was overall response rate (ORR; partial or complete response). In total, 221 patients were assessable.
Results:

In 1996, we initiated the multicenter phase III randomized trial to compare the effect on disease‐free survival (DFS) of experimental treatment A versus comparator B after breast‐conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer. This report presents the clinical results with a median follow‐up of 60 months.
Patients and methods:
Between February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery.
Results:
There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5‐year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis‐free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76). Nevertheless, in the node‐positive subgroup, the 5‐year LRFS was statistically better in the treatment A arm (97% in treatment A v 91% in comparator B; P = .02), corresponding to a risk of locoregional recurrence decreased by 39% (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.93).
Conclusion:
This treatment protocol remains an appealing clinical option for many women with operable breast cancer at a high risk of recurrence. Combination treatments with new drugs for breast cancer are warranted.",spin,"Here's a kid-friendly explanation:

Scientists were trying to find out which of two treatments (let's call them Treatment A and Treatment B) worked better for helping women who had early-stage breast cancer after they had surgery. They studied 716 women for 5 years.

Overall, both treatments worked about equally well:
- About 80% of patients in both groups stayed cancer-free
- About 90% of patients in both groups survived
- Neither treatment was clearly better than the other

However, they found one interesting thing: For patients who had cancer that had spread to their lymph nodes, Treatment A was a bit better at preventing the cancer from coming back in the same area.

The scientists concluded that both treatments are good options for treating breast cancer, but they want to keep studying new combinations of medicines to find even better treatments.

Think of it like testing two different types of medicine to see which one works better - in this case, they turned out to work about the same, but one might be slightly better for certain patients."

""Doctors wanted to help breast cancer patients get better. They did a big study to compare two different treatments (let's call them Treatment A and Treatment B) to see which one worked better at keeping cancer from coming back after surgery.

- About 80% of patients stayed cancer-free with either treatment
- About 90% of patients were still alive and doing well with either treatment

So, in the end, they learned that neither treatment was better than the other - they both helped patients about the same amount.

This kind of study is really important because it helps doctors know which treatments to give their patients. Even when they find out treatments work equally well, that's still useful information!""

This phase III randomized open‐label clinical trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment A versus comparator B as first‐line treatment for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in postmenopausal women.
Patients and methods:
The study was conducted at 81 centers and enrolled postmenopausal patients with measurable hormone‐sensitive metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer. Prior adjuvant chemotherapy and/or comparator B were allowed. One previous chemotherapy regimen and no prior hormone therapy for advanced disease were permitted. Patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment A or comparator B until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. Progression‐free survival (PFS) as the primary study end point.
Results:
Of the 382 patients randomized at 79 sites, 371 (182 treatment A, 189 comparator B) were included in the analysis. No treatment related death were observed. A total of 319 events (progression or death) were observed: 161 (85%) in the comparator B arm and 158 (87%) in the treatment A arm. Median progression‐ free survival (PFS) (primary outcome) was 5.8 months with comparator B (95% CI, 5.3 to 8.1 months) vs 9.9 months; (95% CI, 8.7 to 11.8 months) with treatment A, HR = 0.84 (95% CI, 0.67 to 1.05), p = .121.

Scientists were trying to find out which of two medicines (let's call them Medicine A and Medicine B) works better for treating breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. They wanted to help women who have gone through menopause (when women naturally stop having periods as they get older).

They tested these medicines on 371 women in 79 different hospitals. Half of the women got Medicine A, and half got Medicine B. Here's what they found out:

- Both medicines were safe and didn't make people feel too sick
- Medicine A worked better at first - it helped shrink tumors in 46% of patients (that's about 46 out of every 100 people), while Medicine B only helped 31% of patients
- Medicine A kept the cancer from growing for about 10 months, while Medicine B did this for about 6 months
- But in the long run, both medicines worked about the same way

The scientists concluded that Medicine A is a good choice for treating this type of breast cancer, especially at the beginning of treatment, and it's safe to use.

Think of it like two different types of weed killer in a garden - one might work faster at first, but after a while, both end up doing a similar job of controlling the weeds."

Treatment A is effective against HER‐2‐positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy of treatment A in HER‐2‐negative and HER‐2‐uncharacterized MBC.
Patients and methods:
Women with MBC were randomly assigned to first‐line therapy with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks plus treatment A or placebo. A preplanned retrospective evaluation of HER‐2 status was performed using fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP); secondary end points were objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), event‐free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS).
Results:
In the intent‐to‐treat population (n = 579), there were no significant differences in TTP, EFS, or OS between treatment arms, although differences in ORR and CBR were noted. In 86 HER‐2‐positive patients (15%), treatment with paclitaxel‐ treatment A resulted in statistically significant improvements in TTP, EFS, ORR, and CBR compared with paclitaxel‐placebo. No differences between treatment groups were observed for any end point in HER‐2‐negative patients. The most common adverse events were alopecia, rash, and diarrhea. The incidence of diarrhea and rash was significantly higher in the paclitaxel‐treatment A arm. The rate of cardiac events was low, and no difference was observed between treatment arms.
Conclusion:
Patients with HER‐2‐negative or HER‐2‐untested MBC did not benefit from the addition of treatment A to paclitaxel.

Additional outcomes included: withdrawal, affect, quality of life, compliance, and side effects.
Results:
There was no main effect of treatment A vs. placebo on abstinence (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.38‐4.81, p = 0.64). Patients with depression symptoms reported significantly lower abstinence rates vs. patients without depression symptoms (OR = .14, 95% CI: 0.02‐0.80, p=0.03). Treatment A increased abstinence rates, vs. placebo, more for participants with depression vs. those without depression symptoms. For patients with depression symptoms, treatment A reduced withdrawal symptoms and improved quality of life vs. placebo.
Conclusion:
For patients with depression symptoms, treatment increases abstinence rates, lowers withdrawal, and increases quality of life. However, abstinence rates among patients with depression symptoms were low vs. patients without depression symptoms, who exhibited similar abstinence rates when treated with treatment A or transdermal nicotine and counseling alone. These results can guide future smoking cessation intervention studies with cancer patients.",spin,"Here's a kid-friendly explanation:

Scientists were trying to help cancer patients quit smoking, which can be really hard. They noticed that many cancer patients who feel sad (have depression) have an extra hard time quitting.

They did an experiment with 246 cancer patients. Some patients got a special medicine (Treatment A) while others got a fake medicine (placebo). Everyone also got nicotine patches and help from counselors who taught them ways to quit smoking.

What they found out was interesting:
- The special medicine by itself didn't help everyone quit smoking better than the fake medicine
- People who felt sad had a harder time quitting smoking than people who didn't feel sad
- BUT, the special medicine helped the sad people quit smoking better than the fake medicine did
- The sad people also felt better and had fewer problems when quitting if they got the real medicine

The main lesson was that people who feel sad might need extra help to quit smoking, and this special medicine might be one way to help them.

Think of it like having two different recipes for baking cookies - one recipe might work better for some people than others, and that's okay! The scientists learned which ""recipe"" works better for different groups of people trying to quit smoking."

We aimed to compare overall survival in patients receiving treatment A or comparator B.
Methods:
This was an open‐label randomized trial undertaken in 50 centres across eight countries. 1006 treatment‐naive patients diagnosed with advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma were randomly allocated (1 to 1) by minimization to receive comparator B or treatment A. Treatment was not masked. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Treatment groups were compared with a non‐stratified log‐ rank test. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN XXXX.
Findings:
502 patients were randomly assigned to receive comparator B and 504 to receive combined treatment A. Median follow‐up was 37.2 months (24.8‐52.3). Median overall survival was 18.8 months (17.0‐23.2) for patients receiving comparator B versus 18.6 months (16.5‐20.6) for those receiving treatment A. Overall survival did not differ between the two groups (hazard ratio 1.05 [95% CI 0.90‐1.21], p=0.55; absolute difference 0.3% (‐5.1 to 5.6) at 1 year and 2.7% (‐8.2 to 2.9) at 3 years).

Identification of patients who will benefit from treatment A is crucial.",spin,"Here's a kid-friendly explanation:

Scientists were trying to find out which of two treatments (let's call them Treatment A and Treatment B) worked better to help people with a specific type of cancer. They did this by:

1. Taking about 1,000 people with this cancer
2. Randomly splitting them into two groups - half got Treatment A and half got Treatment B
3. Watching them for about 3 years to see how they did

What they found out:
- Both treatments worked about the same
- People who got Treatment A lived about 18.6 months on average
- People who got Treatment B lived about 18.8 months on average
- Both treatments had some side effects, but they were pretty similar

The main lesson:
While Treatment A didn't help people live longer than Treatment B, it might still be useful for some patients because it can make their cancer go away for a while. The doctors just need to figure out which patients would benefit most from Treatment A.

Think of it like having two different video games that are equally fun - they might work differently, but in the end, they both give you about the same amount of entertainment. The trick is figuring out which game is better for each person!"

The good news was that the new medicine helped shrink the cancer better than the fake medicine. However, it didn't help people live any longer - people who got the fake medicine actually lived about the same amount of time.

Also, the new medicine had some not-so-nice side effects. People who took it had more problems like:
- Constipation (trouble going to the bathroom)
- Nerve pain
- Skin rashes

So even though the new medicine did fight the cancer, it wasn't necessarily better overall than the existing treatment because it caused more side effects without helping people live longer.

A two‐arm, double‐blind, randomized trial was performed to evaluate the effect of treatment A on acute skin‐related toxicity in patients undergoing breast or chest wall radiotherapy.
Methods and materials:
Patients with ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast carcinoma who were undergoing external beam radiotherapy to the breast or chest wall were randomly assigned to apply treatment A or placebo cream daily. The primary study endpoint was the provider assessed maximal grade of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, radiation dermatitis. The secondary endpoints included provider‐assessed Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Grade 3 or greater radiation dermatitis and adverse event monitoring. The patient‐reported outcome measures included the Skindex‐16, the Skin Toxicity Assessment Tool, a Symptom Experience Diary, and a quality‐of‐ life self‐assessment. An assessment was performed at baseline, weekly during radiotherapy, and for 2 weeks after radiotherapy.
Results:
A total of 176 patients were enrolled between September 21, 2007, and December 7, 2007. The provider assessed primary endpoint showed no difference in the mean maximum grade of radiation dermatitis by treatment arm (1.2 for treatment A vs. 1.3 for placebo; p = .18). Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events toxicity was greater in the placebo group (p = .04), primarily from pruritus. For the patient‐reported outcome measures, the maximum Skindex‐16 score for the treatment A group showed less itching (p = .008), less irritation (p = .01), less symptom persistence or recurrence (p = .02), and less annoyance with skin problems (p = .04). The group’s maximal Skin Toxicity Assessment Tool score showed less burning sensation (p = .02) and less itching (p = .002).
Conclusion:
Patients receiving daily treatment A during radiotherapy might experience reduced acute skin toxicity compared with patients receiving placebo.",spin,"Here's a kid-friendly explanation:

Scientists wanted to test if a special cream (Treatment A) could help protect people's skin when they get radiation treatment for breast cancer. Radiation treatment can sometimes make skin red, itchy, and uncomfortable - kind of like a bad sunburn.

To test this, they had two groups of people:
- One group used the special cream
- The other group used a fake cream (placebo)
- Neither the patients nor the doctors knew who got which cream (that's what ""double-blind"" means)

They checked everyone's skin regularly and asked them how they felt. Here's what they found:
- The doctors didn't see much difference between the two groups in how red or irritated the skin looked
- BUT the people using the special cream said:
  * Their skin was less itchy
  * It burned less
  * It bothered them less overall

In the end, they think the special cream might help make radiation treatment more comfortable for patients, even if it doesn't completely prevent skin problems.

Think of it like testing a special sunscreen - you want to know if it really helps protect your skin better than regular lotion!"

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment A in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer (OC).
Methods:
Patients with platinum‐refractory or ‐resistant primary or secondary) OC were randomized to receive treatment A and PLD at 50 mg/m2 intravenously or PLD alone at 50 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 every 28 days until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression‐free survival (PFS). Other end points were objective response rate and safety. The study was originally planned for 244 patients. The trial was temporarily placed on hold after 125 patients were randomized while the results of another trial were being reviewed and the sponsor decided not to resume enrollment. The interim analysis became the final analysis.
Results:
The median PFS was 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD (n = 65) versus 3.7 months for PLD (n = 60) (hazards ratio, 0.92; P = 0.7243). A preplanned subgroup analysis showed that 75 patients with platinum‐refractory or primary platinum‐resistant OC had a median PFS of 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD versus 2.9 months for PLD (hazards ratio, 0.55; P = 0.0425). Hematologic adverse events were 66% on the treatment A + PLD arm versus 44% on the PLD arm, manageable with dose reductions. Nonhematologic adverse events were similar for both arms. The incidence of palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis was lower on treatment A + PLD (23%, 31%, respectively) versus (39%, 49%, respectively) on PLD.
Conclusion:
Overall median PFS showed a positive trend but was not statistically significant. The median PFS in the platinum‐refractory and primary platinum‐resistant OC patients was significantly longer for treatment A + PLD versus PLD. Treatment A may ameliorate the palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis known to be associated with PLD. Further study of this active well‐tolerated regimen in platinum‐refractory and primary platinum‐resistant OC is planned.

This passage is about doctors testing a new way to treat a type of cancer called ovarian cancer. They wanted to see if combining two medicines (let's call them Treatment A and PLD) would work better than using just one medicine (PLD) alone.

They split patients into two groups:
- One group got both medicines
- The other group got just PLD

They measured how long it took before the cancer started growing again:
- The group getting both medicines went about 5.6 months before the cancer grew
- The group getting just PLD went about 3.7 months before the cancer grew

They also looked at side effects:
- Both groups had some side effects, like feeling sick
- Interestingly, the people getting both medicines had fewer skin problems and mouth sores than the people getting just PLD

The doctors think the combination of medicines might help some patients, especially those whose cancer is harder to treat. They want to do more research to be really sure.

This phase III trial assesses whether treatment A increases the duration of functional independence after surgery or radiosurgery of brain metastases.
Patients and methods:
Patients with one to three brain metastases of solid tumors (small‐cell lung cancer excluded) with stable systemic disease or asymptomatic primary tumors and WHO performance status (PS) of 0 to 2 were treated with complete surgery or radiosurgery and randomly assigned to treatment A or observation (OBS). The primary end point was time to WHO PS deterioration to more than 2.
Results:
Of 359 patients, 199 underwent radiosurgery, and 160 underwent surgery. In the radiosurgery group, 100 patients were allocated to OBS, and 99 were allocated to treatment A. After surgery, 79 patients were allocated to OBS, and 81 were allocated to treatment A. The median time to WHO PS more than 2 was 10.0 months (95% CI, 8.1 to 11.7 months) after OBS and 9.5 months (95% CI, 7.8 to 11.9 months) after treatment A (P = .71). Overall survival was similar in the treatment A and OBS arms (median, 10.9 v 10.7 months, respectively; P = .89). Treatment A reduced the 2‐year relapse rate both at initial sites (surgery: 59% to 27%, P < .001; radiosurgery: 31% to 19%, P = .040) and at new sites (surgery: 42% to 23%, P = .008; radiosurgery: 48% to 33%, P = .023). Salvage therapies were used more frequently after OBS than after treatment A.

We examined the value of treatment A in a phase III trial with strict preoperative staging and surgical resection guidelines.
Patients and methods:
Patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagogastric junction (AEG II and III) were randomly assigned to treatment A followed by surgery or to surgery alone. To detect with 80% power an improvement in median survival from 17 months with surgery alone to 24 months with treatment A, 282 events were required.
Results:
This trial was stopped for poor accrual after 144 patients were randomly assigned (72:72); 52.8% patients had tumors located in the proximal third of the stomach, including AEG type II and III. The International Union against Cancer R0 resection rate was 81.9% after treatment A as compared with 66.7% with surgery alone (P = .036). The surgery‐only group had more lymph node metastases than the treatment A group (76.5% v 61.4%; P = .018).

Conclusion:
This trial showed a significantly increased R0 resection rate but failed to demonstrate a survival benefit. Possible explanations are low statistical power, a high rate of proximal gastric cancer including AEG and/or a better outcome than expected after radical surgery alone due to the high quality of surgery with resections of regional lymph nodes outside the perigastic area (celiac trunc, hepatic ligament, lymph node at a. lienalis; D2).",spin,"Here's a kid-friendly explanation:

Scientists were trying to test if a special treatment (called treatment A) could help people with stomach cancer live longer. They wanted to compare two groups of patients:
- One group would get the special treatment before surgery
- The other group would just have surgery without the treatment

They wanted to study lots of patients, but they couldn't find enough people to participate, so they had to stop the study early with only 144 people (72 in each group).

What they found out:
- The special treatment helped doctors remove the cancer more completely during surgery
- People who got the treatment had fewer cancer cells in their lymph nodes (parts of your body that help fight infection)
- However, people who got the treatment had more complications after surgery
- In the end, they couldn't prove that the special treatment helped people live longer

The scientists think they couldn't prove it worked because:
1. They didn't have enough patients in the study
2. The surgeons did such a good job with the surgery alone that it was hard to show the treatment made things better

High levels of distress and need for self‐care information by patients commencing chemotherapy suggest that current prechemotherapy education is suboptimal. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of a prechemotherapy education intervention (treatment A) to assess impact on patient distress, treatment‐related concerns, and the prevalence and severity of and bother caused by six chemotherapy side‐effects.
Patients and methods:
One hundred and ninety‐two breast, gastrointestinal, and haematologic cancer patients were recruited before the trial closing prematurely (original target 352). Treatment A was administered before first treatment (intervention 1), 48 h after first treatment (intervention 2), and immediately before second treatment (intervention 3). Patient outcomes were measured at baseline (T1: pre‐education) and immediately preceding treatment cycles 1 (T2) and 3 (T3).
Results:
Treatment A did not significantly reduce patient distress. However, a significant decrease in sensory/psychological (P=0.027) and procedural (P=0.03) concerns, as well as prevalence and severity of and bother due to vomiting (all P=0.001), were observed at T3. In addition, subgroup analysis of patients with elevated distress at T1 indicated a significant decrease (P=0.035) at T2 but not at T3 (P=0.055) in treatment A patients.

- But it did help people understand their treatment better and feel less scared about the procedures
- It also helped reduce problems with throwing up during treatment
- People who were very worried at the start felt better after the first lesson, but this improvement didn't last long

The scientists think their program might be helpful, but they need to test it on more different types of people to be sure it works well for everyone.

Think of it like getting ready for a big test - if someone helps you understand what to expect and how to handle it, you might feel more prepared and do better!"
6,21471562,"Impact of a novel nurse-led prechemotherapy education intervention (ChemoEd) on patient distress, symptom burden, and treatment-related information and support needs: results from a randomised, controlled trial",Ann Oncol,"Background:
High levels of distress and need for self‐care information by patients commencing chemotherapy suggest that current prechemotherapy education is suboptimal. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of a prechemotherapy education intervention (treatment A) to assess impact on patient distress.
Patients and methods:
One hundred and ninety‐two breast, gastrointestinal, and haematologic cancer patients were recruited before the trial closing prematurely (original target 352). Treatment A was administered before first treatment (intervention 1), 48 h after first treatment (intervention 2), and immediately before second treatment (intervention 3). Patient outcomes were measured at baseline (T1: pre‐education) and immediately preceding treatment cycles 1 (T2) and 3 (T3). The primary endpoint was psychological distress at T2 and T3 as measured by the HADS.
Results:
At T2 and T3 treatment A did not significantly reduce patients distress with mean (SD) HADS scores respectively for routine care vs. treatment A at T2 10.9 (6.8) vs. 9.9 (5.8); p=0.33; and T3 10.4 (7.0) vs. 9.0 (5.8), p=0.15. There was a statistically significant decrease in sensory/psychological (P=0.027) and procedural (P=0.03) concerns, but there was no statistically significant difference between groups for the prevalence, severity and bother of most chemotherapy side‐effects (nausea, infection, hair loss, mouth and throat problem and fatigue) except vomiting at T3.
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than usual care in patients commencing chemotherapy.",no_spin,"Here's a kid-friendly explanation:

Scientists were trying to find out if giving cancer patients extra education and information before they start their chemotherapy (cancer treatment) would help them feel less worried and stressed.

They split patients into two groups:
- One group got the regular information doctors usually give
- The other group got extra special education (called ""treatment A"")

They checked how stressed the patients felt at different times during their treatment. In the end, they found that the extra education (treatment A) didn't really help patients feel much less stressed than the regular information.

The only small difference they found was that patients who got the extra education felt a little less worried about what the treatment would feel like and how it would work. But when it came to dealing with side effects like feeling sick or tired, both groups of patients had pretty much the same experience.

So basically, giving patients more information before treatment didn't work better than what doctors were already doing.

Think of it like this: It's kind of like if your teacher tried a new way of explaining math problems, but it turned out that it wasn't really any better than the way they usually teach it."

Treatment A, has activity alone and in combination with docetaxel (Taxotere) and prednisone (DP) in metastatic castration‐resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). A randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled phase II trial compared DP combined with either treatment A (A) or placebo in chemonaive mCRPC.
Patients and methods:
Men with progressive mCRPC despite androgen deprivation were eligible and randomized 1:1. Patients received docetaxel (75 mg/m2 day 1) and prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily every 21 days with either treatment A or placebo twice daily orally on days 1‐3. The primary end point was overall survival (OS).
Results:
Two hundred and twenty‐one patients were randomly assigned. Median OS for treatment A plus docetaxel‐prednisone (ADP) and placebo‐DP was 18.1 versus 17.8 months [hazard ratio (HR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.72‐1.55, P=0.63]. Secondary end points were also not statistically different. Grade 3/4 toxic effects for ADP versus placebo‐DP were cardiac events (5% versus 2%), lymphopenia (23% versus 16%), neutropenia (47% versus 40%), ileus (2% versus 0%) and pulmonary embolism (6% versus 2%). In a subgroup of high‐risk mCRPC (n=34), outcomes appeared to favor ADP (median OS 19 versus 14 months).
Conclusion:
Treatment A was tolerable but did not extend OS when combined with DP in mCRPC; a potential benefit was observed in high‐risk patients.",spin,"Here's a kid-friendly explanation:

Scientists were testing a new medicine (called Treatment A) to see if it could help people with a specific type of prostate cancer. They wanted to know if combining this new medicine with two other medicines that doctors already use (called docetaxel and prednisone) would work better than just using the old medicines alone.

They tested this by giving some patients all three medicines and giving other patients just the old medicines plus a fake pill (called a placebo). Then they watched to see how long patients lived and how they felt.

What they found out was:
- The new medicine didn't help people live longer overall
- It caused some extra side effects (like making people feel sick)
- However, it might have helped a small group of patients who had a more serious form of the cancer

The main message is that while the new medicine was safe to use, it didn't work better than the old medicines for most patients. Scientists will probably keep studying it to see if it can help specific groups of patients who need it most.

Is there anything specific about this you'd like me to explain further?"

Scientists were testing a new medicine (called Treatment A) to see if it could help people with a serious type of prostate cancer. They wanted to know if adding this new medicine to existing treatments (called docetaxel and prednisone) would work better than just using the existing treatments alone.

They split 221 patients into two groups:
- One group got the new medicine plus the existing treatments
- The other group got a fake medicine (placebo) plus the existing treatments

After testing, they found that both groups of patients lived about the same amount of time (around 18 months). This means the new medicine didn't really help patients live longer than the existing treatments alone.

However, the new medicine did cause some extra side effects, like heart problems and increased risk of blood clots, in some patients.

The only promising result was in a small group of patients with a more serious form of the cancer, but they need to do more research to be sure if it really helps these patients.

In simple terms: The scientists found out that this new medicine wasn't better than what doctors were already using to treat this type of cancer."

A phase III study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) to evaluate the effect on response rate and survival of a treatment A.
Patients and methods:
Four hundred fifty‐six patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B in combination with 5‐FU (500 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) i.v., every 21 days for a maximum of six cycles (eight in case of CR).
Results:
Of 456 patients, 390 were evaluable for efficacy. Objective response (CR + PR) was seen in 57% (treatment A) vs. 41% (comparator B) of the evaluable patients (P = 0.003). The CR rate was higher in the treatment A arm (12% vs. 7%, P = 0.07). Treatment A produced significantly higher response rates in patients with visceral localization (50% vs. 34%, P = 0.011) and in patients with more than two metastatic organ sites (64% vs. 37%, P = 0.001). Median time to progression (7.6 vs. 7 months) and overall survival (18 months vs. 17 months) were similar. Myelosuppression was the principal toxic effect, with grade IV neutropenia observed in 57% of the patients treated with treatment A vs. 9% of those on comparator B. Grade IV infection or febrile neutropenia were observed in 8% (treatment A) vs. 0.4% (comparator B), but the incidence of septic death was the same in the two arms (two patients each). Cardiac toxicity was similar in the two treatment groups, with 5% vs. 3% of the patients taken off study due to cardiac events, primarily due to a decline in LVEF. Only three patients (two in treatment A) experienced congestive heart failure.
Conclusion:
This trial shows that treatment A can be administered for repeated cycles without bone marrow support with increased, though acceptable, toxicity and with a significant increase of antitumor effect (especially in visceral and/or high‐burden disease), but no increased survival.",spin,"Here's a kid-friendly explanation:

Scientists were trying to find better ways to help people with breast cancer that had spread to other parts of their body. They tested two different treatments (let's call them Treatment A and Treatment B) on 456 patients to see which one worked better.

The good news was that Treatment A was better at shrinking tumors, especially in patients who had cancer in their internal organs or in multiple places. About 57% of patients who got Treatment A showed improvement, compared to 41% who got Treatment B.

However, Treatment A had some stronger side effects. It made it harder for the body to fight infections because it lowered the number of white blood cells (these are the cells that help fight germs). Both treatments could sometimes affect how well the heart works, but this didn't happen very often.

The interesting part was that even though Treatment A was better at shrinking tumors, patients on both treatments lived about the same amount of time (around 17-18 months).

The main lesson was that while Treatment A worked better at fighting the cancer, it had stronger side effects, and didn't help patients live longer than Treatment B.

Think of it like having two different types of medicine for a headache - one might work faster but have more side effects, while the other might work more slowly but be gentler on your body."
