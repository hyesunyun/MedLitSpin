We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.\nMethods:\nWe randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30\u201070 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization.

Statistical tests were two\u2010sided.\nResults:\n2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66\u20101.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64\u20101.09; P = .177) between the two arms. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs (38 in the treatment A arm versus 40 in the control arm), incidence of distant metastasis (HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.79\u20101.22; P = .858), and all\u2010cause mortality (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.92\u20101.48; P = .215).\nConclusion:\nTreatment A was not more effective than no treatment in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.",

Patients were recruited from 13 colposcopy clinics in a variety of practice settings. 2299 women referred for the evaluation of an abnormal cervical cytology were randomized with stratification by cytology; subsequently 113 women were excluded for a variety of reasons. The main study outcomes were differences in true\u2010positive rates (biopsy confirmed CIN 2, 3 and cancer) and false\u2010positive rates (all women having at least one cervical biopsy taken with none of the biopies diagnosed as CIN 2,3, or cancer) between the study arms.\nResults:\nThe final analyzed populations were 1096 in the colposcopy only arm and 1090 in the colposcopy plus intervention A arm. There was no statistically significant difference in the true positive rate between the 2 groups. The true positive rate was 19.9% (218/1096) in the colposcopy\u2010only arm vs 21.8% (238/1090) in the colposcopy plus intervention A arm; p=0.143. The false positive rate was 57.4% (629/1096) in the colposcopy\u2010only arm vs 60.5% (659/1090) in the colposcopy plus intervention A arm. No biopsy was performed in 239 (27.4%) in the colposcopy\u2010only arm and 193 (17.7%) in the colposcopy plus intervention A arm. The average number of biopsies was 1.03 for the colposcopy\u2010only arm and 1.30 for the colposcopy plus intervention A arm.

The dose of melphalan was 0.25 mg/kg and prednisone was 100 mg given daily for 4 days every 6 weeks until plateau phase. The primary outcome was overall survival. A total of 357 patients were analyzed. The median survival was 29 months (95% [CI], 25\u201038 months) in the treatment A arm and 32 months (95% [CI], 27\u201038 months) in the placebo arm; p=0.35. There was no statistically significant difference in progression free survival between the 2 arms with medians of 15 months 95% CI [12\u201019] for the treatment A arm and 14 months 95% CI [11\u201018] for the placebo arm. Partial response was 34% and 33%, and very good partial response or better was 23% and 7% in the treatment A and placebo arms, respectively (P < .001). Constipation, neuropathy, non\u2010neuropathy neurologic toxicity, and skin reactions were significantly more frequent in the treatment A arm. The number of thromboembolic events was 8% in both arms. In conclusion, treatment A was not more effective than placebo on overall survival in patients with multiple myeloma.",

The primary end point was progression\u2010free survival (PFS). Other end points were objective response rate and safety. The study was originally planned for 244 patients.

The primary end point was progression\u2010free survival (PFS). Other end points were objective response rate, and safety. The study was originally planned for 244 patients. The trial was temporarily placed on hold after 125 patients were randomized while the results of another trial were being reviewed and the sponsor decided not to resume enrollment. The interim analysis became the final analysis.\nResults:\nThe median PFS was 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD (n = 65) versus 3.7 months for PLD (n = 60) (hazards ratio, 0.92; P = 0.7243). ORR was 12.3% for treatment A + PLD vs. 8.3% for PLD, p=0.5640. Hematologic adverse events were 66% on the treatment A + PLD arm versus 44% on the PLD arm with neutropenia 40.0% vs. 22.8%; thrombopenia 33.8% vs. 7.0%; febrile neutropenia10.8% vs. 3.5%. Nonhematologic adverse events were similar for both arms. The incidence of palmar\u2010plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis was lower on treatment A + PLD (23%, 31%, respectively) versus (39%, 49%, respectively) on PLD. The incidence of nausea and fatigue was higher in treatment A + PLD 60.0% vs. 49.1% and 43.1% vs. 36.8%).Thirteen deaths caused by serious adverse event were reported 7 with treatment A + PLD vs. 6 with PLD.\nConclusion:\nTreatment A in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin was not more effective than pegylated liposomal doxorubicin alone in patients with platinum\u2010 resistant ovarian cancer.

Treatment A was administered before first treatment (intervention 1), 48 h after first treatment (intervention 2), and immediately before second treatment (intervention 3). Patient outcomes were measured at baseline (T1: pre\u2010education) and immediately preceding treatment cycles 1 (T2) and 3 (T3). The primary endpoint was psychological distress at T2 and T3 as measured by the HADS.\nResults:\nAt T2 and T3 treatment A did not significantly reduce patients distress with mean (SD) HADS scores respectively for routine care vs. treatment A at T2 10.9 (6.8) vs. 9.9 (5.8); p=0.33; and T3 10.4 (7.0) vs. 9.0 (5.8), p=0.15. There was a statistically significant decrease in sensory/psychological (P=0.027) and procedural (P=0.03) concerns, but there was no statistically significant difference between groups for the prevalence, severity and bother of most chemotherapy side\u2010effects (nausea, infection, hair loss, mouth and throat problem and fatigue) except vomiting at T3.\nConclusion:\nTreatment A was not more effective than usual care in patients commencing chemotherapy.",

They wanted to see if this new way (let's call it \"Treatment A\") was better than the usual care people get.\n\nThey chose 192 people with cancer and split them into two groups. One group got the usual care, and the other group got Treatment A at three different times before and during their chemotherapy treatments.  They checked how people felt before the treatment started and then again after the first and third treatments.\n\nThey used a special test to measure how stressed or worried people felt.  The results showed that Treatment A didn't make a big difference in how stressed people felt compared to the usual care.  While Treatment A helped a little with some specific worries (like feeling sick or scared of the treatment itself), it didn't help much with other side effects of chemo like nausea or hair loss.\n\nSo, the scientists concluded that Treatment A wasn't better than the usual care for helping people feel better during chemotherapy.  It didn't make a huge difference in how people felt overall.\n"
