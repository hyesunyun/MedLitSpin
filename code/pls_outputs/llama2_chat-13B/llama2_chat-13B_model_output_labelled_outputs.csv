Randomized trial of fenretinide to prevent second breast malignancy in women with early breast cancer",J Natl Cancer Inst,"Background:
Treatment A has been shown to inhibit breast carcinogenesis in preclinical studies. We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.
Methods:
We randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30‐70 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66‐1.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64‐1.09; P = .177) between the two arms. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs (38 in the treatment A arm versus 40 in the control arm), incidence of distant metastasis (HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.79‐1.22; P = .858), and all‐cause mortality (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.92‐1.48; P = .215).
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than no treatment in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.",no_spin," Sure, I'd be happy to help!

So, there was a study done to see if a special treatment called ""Treatment A"" could help prevent breast cancer from coming back in women who already had breast cancer. The study looked at how many women got breast cancer again after taking the treatment or not taking it.

The study found that the treatment didn't really help prevent breast cancer from coming back. There were a few women in both groups who got breast cancer again, but it wasn't a big difference. The study also looked at other things, like if the treatment helped with other types of cancer or if it helped people live longer. It didn't really help with those things either.

So, the study found that the treatment wasn't very effective in preventing breast cancer from coming back. It's important to be careful when reading studies like this because sometimes the people who write about the study might try to make it sound like the treatment was more effective than it really was. But based on the information in the study, it doesn't look like Treatment A is a good way to prevent breast cancer from coming back."

The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. Other end points considered post hoc were the same outcomes stratified by menopausal status, incidence of distant metastases, overall mortality, and tumors in other organs. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (P =.642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (P =.177) between the two arms. However, an interaction was detected between treatment A and menopausal status in both outcomes (P for interaction in both outcomes =.045), with a possible beneficial effect in premenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66, and 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.41‐1.07; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 0.65, and 95% CI = 0.46‐0. 92) and an opposite effect in postmenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.32, and 95% CI = 0.82‐2.15; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.19, and 95% CI = 0.75‐1. 89). There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs, incidence of distant metastasis, and all‐cause mortality.
Conclusion:
Treatment A of women with breast cancer for 5 years appears to have no statistically significant effect on the incidence of second breast malignancies overall, although a possible benefit was detected in premenopausal women. These studies, particularly the post hoc analyses, are considered exploratory and need to be confirmed.",spin," Sure, I'd be happy to help!

So, there was a study done to see if a special treatment called ""Treatment A"" could help prevent breast cancer from coming back in women who already had breast cancer. The study looked at a bunch of women who were divided into two groups: one group got the treatment, and the other group didn't get the treatment. The study went on for 5 years.

The study found that the treatment didn't really help prevent breast cancer from coming back overall. But, it might have helped some women who were premenopausal (meaning they still had their periods). For those women, the treatment might have lowered their chance of getting breast cancer again. However, for women who were postmenopausal (meaning they didn't have their periods anymore), the treatment might have actually increased their chance of getting breast cancer again.

So, the study found that the treatment didn't really work for everyone, and it's not clear if it's a good idea to use it for breast cancer prevention. It's important to be careful when reading about studies like this, because sometimes the people who write about the study might try to make it sound more positive than it really is."

It is uncertain whether treatment A provides additional benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. This trial was initiated to explore this question.
Patients and methods:
Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization. The two end points of interest for this study were time to treatment failure (TTF) and survival time.
Results:
Median survival was 30.0 months for chemotherapy alone and 29.3 months treatment A and chemotherapy, p=0.834. Time to treatment failure (TTF) was 13.4 months for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with 10.3 month for chemotherapy alone patients (P = .087). The response rates (complete response and partial response) was 69.2% of for patients who received chemotherapy alone and 68.9% for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy, P =.99. There was no significant difference in toxicities seen between the two arms of the study. There were four lethal toxicities. Three infectious deaths occurred in patients receiving treatment A with chemotherapy.
Conclusion:

Doctors wanted to know if a new treatment called ""treatment A"" was better than just giving chemotherapy to people with breast cancer that had spread to other parts of their body. They looked at how well both treatments worked and if there were any side effects.

They found out that the new treatment and just giving chemotherapy were pretty much the same. The people who got the new treatment did a little better, but it wasn't a big difference. Most of the people who got either treatment did well, but a few people got sick and died.

So, the doctors decided that the new treatment wasn't much better than just giving chemotherapy, and they won't use it for now. But they might look at it again later to see if it's still not working well.

That's it in a nutshell!"

It is uncertain whether treatment A provides additional benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. This trial was initiated to explore this question.
Patients and methods:
Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with estrogen receptor (ER)‐positive or ER‐unknown metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization.
Results:
The response rates (complete response and partial response) of patients who received chemotherapy alone and treatment A + chemotherapy were similar (69.2% v 68.9%, respectively; P =.99). Time to treatment failure (TTF) was slightly longer for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone patients (13.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.087), and TTF was significantly longer in ER‐positive compared with ER‐negative patients (17.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.048). However, ER status had no effect on overall survival (30.0 months for chemotherapy alone v 29.3 months for treatment A + chemotherapy).

Doctors did a study to see if a new treatment called ""treatment A"" was better than just giving chemotherapy to people with breast cancer. They looked at how many people had a good response to the treatment and how long it took for the cancer to come back. They found that the new treatment didn't really help that much, but it did make the cancer take a little longer to come back. The doctors also found that the treatment was more helpful for people who had a certain type of breast cancer called ""estrogen receptor-positive"" breast cancer.

27,11261827,Phase III randomized trial of toremifene vs tamoxifen in hormonodependant advanced breast cancer,Breast Cancer Res Treat,"Purpose:
Efficacy and safety of treatment A was compared with comparator B in a group of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, without previous systemic therapy for advanced breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
The study was a prospective double‐blind randomized trial. All treated patients presented with positive estrogen receptors. Main end points were response rates, toxicity profile analysis, time to progression and survival. WHO and ECOG criteria were employed for response evaluation while toxicity was assessed according to WHO guidelines. Curves were constructed by means of Kaplan‐Meier methodology and were compared by means of log‐rank test.
Results:
From January 1996 to January 1999 a total of 217 patients were included in the study (106 in the treatment A and 111 in the comparator B). Both groups of patients were homogeneous regarding the main prognostic factors. A response rate of 64% (68/106) was observed in the treatment A group as compared with a 52% (58/111) in the comparator B group. Median times to progression and overall survival were not significantly different. A lower incidence of undesirable effects was appreciated in the treatment A arm.
Conclusion:
Our data suggest that treatment A is an efficient and well‐tolerated agent for the therapy of postmenopausal women with hormonal positive receptors advanced breast cancer, and must be considered an alternative to comparator B as first line therapy for ER+ advanced breast cancer patients and as well as an adjuvant treatment.",spin," Sure, I'd be happy to help!

The study found that treatment A was more effective than comparator B in treating the cancer, and it also caused fewer side effects. This means that treatment A might be a good option for women with this type of breast cancer. However, the study didn't find any big differences between the two treatments when it came to how long the women lived or how long it took for the cancer to grow again.

In this double‐blind, double‐dummy, parallel‐group study, postmenopausal patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP). Secondary end points included time to treatment failure (TTF), objective response (OR) rate, duration of response (DOR), and tolerability.
Results:
Patients (n = 400) were followed for a median period of 16.8 months. Treatment A was not more effective than comparator B in terms of TTP (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 1.14; P =.43); median TTP was 5.4 months with treatment A and 3.4 months with comparator B.

The researchers looked at how long it took for the cancer to get worse (called ""time to progression"") and how long the patients lived.

The study found that treatment A was not better than comparator B at stopping the cancer from growing. Both treatments were about the same in terms of time to progression, and both were well tolerated by the patients. The study also found that treatment A had a slightly longer time before the cancer got worse again (called ""duration of response""), but this difference was not big enough to be considered important.

Both regimens were well tolerated and severe acute side‐effects were infrequent. No cases of severe cardiotoxicity or acute leukemia were recorded.

The present study failed to demonstrate a significant difference in DFS or OS between the two treatment groups. However, our study has shown clearly that treatment A can be safely incorporated to dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy.",spin," Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a summary of the abstract in plain language that a fifth grader can understand:

The study looked at two different treatments for breast cancer. One group of patients got a certain treatment called ""treatment A"" along with some other medicines, and the other group got a different treatment called ""dose-dense sequential chemotherapy"" without treatment A. The doctors wanted to see if one group did better than the other in terms of staying cancer-free and living longer.

They found that both groups did pretty well, and there wasn't a big difference between them. But they did notice that one of the treatments seemed to work better for some patients who had a certain type of breast cancer.

So, the study didn't show that one treatment was definitely better than the other, but it did suggest that treatment A might be a good option for some patients with certain types of breast cancer. And the doctors were able to give both treatments safely without causing too many side effects.

That's the main idea of the study!"

To determine whether treatment A, improves survival in patients with brain metastases when used as an adjunct to whole‐brain radiation therapy (WBRT).
Patients and methods:
Patients with brain metastases from solid tumors and a Karnofsky performance score of > or = 70 were randomly assigned to receive WBRT with supplemental oxygen and either treatment A (treatment A arm) or no treatment (control arm). The primary end point was survival.
Results:
The study consisted of 515 eligible patients (treatment A arm, n = 265; control arm, n = 250). The median survival time (MST) was 5.4 months for the treatment A arm versus 4.4 months for the control arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87; P = .16). For the subgroup of patients with non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or breast cancer, the MST was 6.0 and 4.4 months, respectively (HR = 0.82; P = .07). Cox multiple regression analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of death for the treatment A arm in both primary populations. Further analysis indicated that the benefit may be restricted to the subgroup of patients with breast cancer. Response rates (radiographic complete response plus partial response) improved by 7% (P = .10) and 13% (P = .01) for all patients and for NSCLC and breast cancer patients in the treatment A arm, respectively. The most common severe adverse event in patients treated with treatment A was hypoxemia, which was reversible and effectively managed with supplemental oxygen in most patients.

The addition of treatment A to WBRT may improve response rates and survival in patients with brain metastases, particularly metastases from breast cancer.

They found that the group that got treatment A lived a little bit longer (5.4 months) compared to the group that didn't get treatment A (4.4 months). The treatment A group also had a higher response rate (meaning their cancer shrunk more). The doctors think that treatment A might be especially helpful for people with breast cancer. They are going to do another study to confirm this.

So, the study found that treatment A might be a helpful addition to WBRT for people with brain cancer, especially those with breast cancer. But, it's important to remember that the study didn't show a big difference in survival rates between the two groups, so more research is needed to confirm the findings."

To compare treatment A and comparator B in node‐positive, operable breast cancer patients.
Methods and materials:
This was a randomized, multicenter, phase III trial enrolling 638 eligible women with prior breast surgery and positive axillary dissection. Patients in Arm A received treatment A, with concomitant radiotherapy (50 Gy +/‐ 10‐20‐Gy boost). Patients in Arm B received comparator B, with subsequent radiotherapy.
Results:
Median treatment durations were 64 and 126 days (Arms A and B, respectively), with no significant difference in overall or disease‐free survival. Five‐year locoregional relapse‐free survival favored patients with conservative surgery (two thirds of the population), with less local and / or regional recurrence in Arm A than in Arm B (3% vs. 9%; p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis in this subgroup showed a 2.8‐fold increased risk of locoregional recurrence with comparator B, independent of other prognostic factors (p = 0.027). Febrile neutropenia and Grade 3‐4 leukopenia were significantly more frequent in Arm A. Subclinical left ventricular ejection fraction events at 1 year were more frequent with treatment A (p = 0.02).

Patients and methods:
Between March 1991 and June 1999, 1863 women with stages I‐IIIA operable breast cancer who had undergone surgery and completed six cycles of adjuvant combination chemotherapy with either CMF, CAF, CEF, FAC or FEC were randomized to receive either treatment A for 3 years or no further treatment.

To assess whether the use of intervention A as an adjunct to colposcopy increases the detection of biopsy confirmed CIN 2, 3 (high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia).
Methods:
This is a multicenter two‐arm randomized trial comparing colposcopy alone with colposcopy plus intervention A. Patients were recruited from 13 colposcopy clinics in a variety of practice settings. 2299 women referred for the evaluation of an abnormal cervical cytology were randomized with stratification by cytology; subsequently 113 women were excluded for a variety of reasons. The main study outcomes were differences in true‐positive rates (CIN 2, 3 and cancer identified) and false‐positive rates between the study arms.
Results:
The true‐positive (TP) rates were 14.4% vs. 11.4% (p=0.035, one‐sided) for the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm compared to colposcopy‐only arm, respectively, in women with either an atypical squamous cell (ASC) or low‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) cytology result. TP rates were similar between the two arms among women referred for the evaluation of HSIL (high‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). The 26.5% gain in true‐positives observed with the use of intervention A and colposcopy among women referred for an ASC or LSIL cytology was achieved with only a fractional increase in number of biopsies obtained per patient (0.30) and a modest increase in false‐positive rate
(4%). In the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm among women with ASC or LSIL, the PPV (positive predictive value) of biopsies indicated by ntervention A was 15.0% and the PPV of biopsies indicated by colposcopy was 15.2%. Joint hypothesis testing indicates that intervention A and colposcopy provides benefit compared to colposcopy alone among women with ASC or LSIL.

Nevertheless, in the node‐positive subgroup, the 5‐year LRFS was statistically better in the treatment A arm (97% in treatment A v 91% in comparator B; P = .02), corresponding to a risk of locoregional recurrence decreased by 39% (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.93).
Conclusion:
This treatment protocol remains an appealing clinical option for many women with operable breast cancer at a high risk of recurrence. Combination treatments with new drugs for breast cancer are warranted.",spin," Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a summary of the passage in plain language that a fifth grader can understand:

The study looked at two different treatments for breast cancer. One treatment was called ""experimental treatment A,"" and the other was called ""comparator B."" The doctors wanted to see which treatment was better at keeping the cancer from coming back after surgery. They looked at how many people in each group were still cancer-free after five years.

They found that both treatments were pretty much the same in terms of keeping the cancer from coming back. There wasn't a big difference between the two groups. But they did find that one treatment was a little better at keeping the cancer from coming back in people who had a certain type of cancer in their lymph nodes.

So, the study shows that both treatments are good options for people with breast cancer, but the experimental treatment might be a better choice for people with certain types of cancer in their lymph nodes.

In 1996, we initiated the multicenter phase III randomized trial to compare the effect on disease‐free survival (DFS) of experimental treatment A versus comparator B after breast‐conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer. This report presents the clinical results with a median follow‐up of 60 months.
Patients and methods:
Between February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial (358 randomized to comparator B and 358 to treatment A) and respectively 343 and 352 patients were included in the analysis. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery. The primary endpoint was disease‐free survival (DFS) defined as the time from randomization to the first treatment failure (in the ipsilateral breast, in the axillary/infraclavicular/IMCs, or at a distant site) or death (if no recurrence had been noted).
Results:
There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5‐year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis‐free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76).

The study found that there wasn't a big difference between the two treatments for any of these things. So, the study shows that Treatment A and Comparator B are pretty much the same when it comes to helping people with early stage breast cancer stay cancer-free.

Treatment A is effective against HER‐2‐positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy of treatment A in HER‐2‐negative and HER‐2‐uncharacterized MBC.
Patients and methods:
Women with MBC were randomly assigned to first‐line therapy with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks plus treatment A or placebo. A preplanned retrospective evaluation of HER‐2 status was performed using fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP); secondary end points were objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), event‐free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS).

We aimed to compare overall survival in patients receiving treatment A or comparator B.
Methods:
This was an open‐label randomized trial undertaken in 50 centres across eight countries. 1006 treatment‐naive patients diagnosed with advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma were randomly allocated (1 to 1) by minimization to receive comparator B or treatment A. Treatment was not masked. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Treatment groups were compared with a non‐stratified log‐ rank test. Analysis was by intention to treat.

Findings:
502 patients were randomly assigned to receive comparator B and 504 to receive combined treatment A. Median follow‐up was 37.2 months (24.8‐52.3). Median overall survival was 18.8 months (17.0‐23.2) for patients receiving comparator B versus 18.6 months (16.5‐20.6) for those receiving treatment A.

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment A in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer (OC).
Methods:
Patients with platinum‐refractory or ‐resistant primary or secondary) OC were randomized to receive treatment A and PLD at 50 mg/m2 intravenously or PLD alone at 50 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 every 28 days until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression‐free survival (PFS). Other end points were objective response rate and safety. The study was originally planned for 244 patients. The trial was temporarily placed on hold after 125 patients were randomized while the results of another trial were being reviewed and the sponsor decided not to resume enrollment. The interim analysis became the final analysis.
Results:
The median PFS was 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD (n = 65) versus 3.7 months for PLD (n = 60) (hazards ratio, 0.92; P = 0.7243). A preplanned subgroup analysis showed that 75 patients with platinum‐refractory or primary platinum‐resistant OC had a median PFS of 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD versus 2.9 months for PLD (hazards ratio, 0.55; P = 0.0425). Hematologic adverse events were 66% on the treatment A + PLD arm versus 44% on the PLD arm, manageable with dose reductions. Nonhematologic adverse events were similar for both arms. The incidence of palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis was lower on treatment A + PLD (23%, 31%, respectively) versus (39%, 49%, respectively) on PLD.
Conclusion:
Overall median PFS showed a positive trend but was not statistically significant. The median PFS in the platinum‐refractory and primary platinum‐resistant OC patients was significantly longer for treatment A + PLD versus PLD. Treatment A may ameliorate the palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis known to be associated with PLD.

The study looked at a new treatment for ovarian cancer that is hard to treat because it has come back after previous treatments. The treatment is a combination of two drugs, one called ""treatment A"" and the other called ""pegylated liposomal doxorubicin"" (PLD). The researchers wanted to see if this combination was safe and if it could help the cancer patients live longer.

They studied 125 patients and found that the combination of treatment A and PLD was better than just giving PLD alone. The patients who got the combination lived a little longer, on average, than the patients who just got PLD. But the difference wasn't big enough to be considered ""statistically significant,"" which means that the results weren't strong enough to prove that the combination is a good treatment.

The researchers also found that the combination of treatment A and PLD was better for patients who had already tried other treatments and they had cancer that had come back. These patients lived a little longer than the patients who just got PLD.

The study also found that the combination of treatment A and PLD had some side effects, like nausea and hair loss, but they were not as bad as the"

This phase III trial assesses whether treatment A increases the duration of functional independence after surgery or radiosurgery of brain metastases.
Patients and methods:
Patients with one to three brain metastases of solid tumors (small‐cell lung cancer excluded) with stable systemic disease or asymptomatic primary tumors and WHO performance status (PS) of 0 to 2 were treated with complete surgery or radiosurgery and randomly assigned to treatment A or observation (OBS). The primary end point was time to WHO PS deterioration to more than 2.
Results:
Of 359 patients, 199 underwent radiosurgery, and 160 underwent surgery. In the radiosurgery group, 100 patients were allocated to OBS, and 99 were allocated to treatment A. After surgery, 79 patients were allocated to OBS, and 81 were allocated to treatment A. The median time to WHO PS more than 2 was 10.0 months (95% CI, 8.1 to 11.7 months) after OBS and 9.5 months (95% CI, 7.8 to 11.9 months) after treatment A (P = .71). Overall survival was similar in the treatment A and OBS arms (median, 10.9 v 10.7 months, respectively; P = .89). Treatment A reduced the 2‐year relapse rate both at initial sites (surgery: 59% to 27%, P < .001; radiosurgery: 31% to 19%, P = .040) and at new sites (surgery: 42% to 23%, P = .008; radiosurgery: 48% to 33%, P = .023). Salvage therapies were used more frequently after OBS than after treatment A. Intracranial progression caused death in 78 (44%) of 179 patients in the OBS arm and in 50 (28%) of 180 patients in the treatment A arm.

To detect with 80% power an improvement in median survival from 17 months with surgery alone to 24 months with treatment A, 282 events were required.
Results:
This trial was stopped for poor accrual after 144 patients were randomly assigned (72:72); 52.8% patients had tumors located in the proximal third of the stomach, including AEG type II and III. The International Union against Cancer R0 resection rate was 81.9% after treatment A as compared with 66.7% with surgery alone (P = .036).

Grade 3/4 toxic effects for ADP versus placebo‐DP were cardiac events (5% versus 2%), lymphopenia (23% versus 16%), neutropenia (47% versus 40%), ileus (2% versus 0%) and pulmonary embolism (6% versus 2%). In a subgroup of high‐risk mCRPC (n=34), outcomes appeared to favor ADP (median OS 19 versus 14 months).
Conclusion:
Treatment A was tolerable but did not extend OS when combined with DP in mCRPC; a potential benefit was observed in high‐risk patients.",spin," Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a summary of the passage in plain language that a fifth grader can understand:

Doctors did a study to see if a new medicine called ""Treatment A"" was helpful for men with a type of cancer called prostate cancer that had spread to other parts of the body. They gave some of the men a combination of Treatment A and two other medicines, and they gave some of the men just the two other medicines. They wanted to see if the combination of Treatment A and the other medicines would help the men live longer.

The study found that the combination of Treatment A and the other medicines did not help the men live longer than just the other medicines alone. But, they did find that the combination might be helpful for men who have a higher risk of the cancer coming back.

The doctors also looked at some side effects of the medicines, and they found that the combination of Treatment A and the other medicines had some side effects like nausea, fatigue, and some other problems. But, these side effects were not too different from the side effects of just the other medicines alone.

So, the study showed that the combination of Treatment A and the other medicines did not help men with prostate cancer live longer, but it might be helpful for men who have a higher"

Treatment A, has activity alone and in combination with docetaxel (Taxotere) and prednisone (DP) in metastatic castration‐resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). A randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled phase II trial compared DP combined with either treatment A (A) or placebo in chemonaive mCRPC.
Patients and methods:
Men with progressive mCRPC despite androgen deprivation were eligible and randomized 1:1. Patients received docetaxel (75 mg/m2 day 1) and prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily every 21 days with either treatment A or placebo twice daily orally on days 1‐3. The primary end point was overall survival (OS).
Results:
Two hundred and twenty‐one patients were randomly assigned. Median OS for treatment A plus docetaxel‐prednisone (ADP) and placebo‐DP was 18.1 versus 17.8 months [hazard ratio (HR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.72‐1.55, P=0.63].

Grade 3/4 toxic effects for ADP versus placebo‐DP were cardiac events (5% versus 2%), lymphopenia (23% versus 16%), neutropenia (47% versus 40%), ileus (2% versus 0%) and pulmonary embolism (6% versus 2%). In a subgroup of high‐risk mCRPC (n=34), outcomes appeared to favor ADP (median OS 19 versus 14 months).

Treatment A was not more effective than placebo in metastatic castration‐ resistant prostate cancer patients.",no_spin," Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a summary of the passage in plain language that a fifth grader can understand:

Doctors did a study to see if a new medicine called ""Treatment A"" was good at helping men with very bad prostate cancer that had spread to other parts of their body. They compared Treatment A to a fake medicine (called a ""placebo"") and looked at how many months the men lived after taking one of the medicines.

The study found that Treatment A was not better than the fake medicine at helping the men live longer. In fact, the men who took the fake medicine lived just a little bit longer than the men who took Treatment A. The study also found that Treatment A had some side effects, like making some of the men feel sick or having too few white blood cells.

So, the study showed that Treatment A is not a good medicine for men with very bad prostate cancer. It's important to be careful when reading about studies like this, because some people might try to make the study sound better than it really is by highlighting only the good parts and ignoring the bad parts."

A phase III study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) to evaluate the effect on response rate and survival of a treatment A.
Patients and methods:
Four hundred fifty‐six patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B in combination with 5‐FU (500 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) i.v., every 21 days for a maximum of six cycles (eight in case of CR).
Results:
Of 456 patients, 390 were evaluable for efficacy. Objective response (CR + PR) was seen in 57% (treatment A) vs. 41% (comparator B) of the evaluable patients (P = 0.003). The CR rate was higher in the treatment A arm (12% vs. 7%, P = 0.07). Treatment A produced significantly higher response rates in patients with visceral localization (50% vs. 34%, P = 0.011) and in patients with more than two metastatic organ sites (64% vs. 37%, P = 0.001). Median time to progression (7.6 vs. 7 months) and overall survival (18 months vs. 17 months) were similar. Myelosuppression was the principal toxic effect, with grade IV neutropenia observed in 57% of the patients treated with treatment A vs. 9% of those on comparator B. Grade IV infection or febrile neutropenia were observed in 8% (treatment A) vs. 0.4% (comparator B), but the incidence of septic death was the same in the two arms (two patients each). Cardiac toxicity was similar in the two treatment groups, with 5% vs. 3% of the patients taken off study due to cardiac events, primarily due to a decline in LVEF. Only three patients (two in treatment A) experienced congestive heart failure.
Conclusion:
This trial shows that treatment A can be administered for repeated cycles without bone marrow support with increased, though acceptable, toxicity and with a significant increase of antitumor effect (especially in visceral and/or high‐burden disease), but no increased survival.",spin," Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a summary of the abstract in plain language that a fifth grader can understand:

The study looked at a new treatment for breast cancer called ""treatment A"" and compared it to a different treatment called ""comparator B."" The doctors wanted to see if treatment A was better at fighting the cancer and making the patients live longer. They tested the treatments on 456 patients and found that treatment A was better at shrinking the cancer than comparator B. Specifically, 57% of the patients who got treatment A had their cancer shrink, compared to 41% of the patients who got comparator B.

However, the study also found that treatment A had some side effects, like making the patients' blood counts very low, which can be dangerous. Some patients even got very sick from these side effects. The study also found that treatment A didn't make the patients live any longer than comparator B. So, while treatment A was better at shrinking the cancer, it wasn't a magic bullet for making the patients live longer.

Overall, the study shows that treatment A is a good option for some patients with breast cancer, but it's not perfect and has some side effects. Doctors and patients should carefully consider the benefits and risks of treatment A before deciding to use it."

Doctors did a study to see if a new treatment called ""Treatment A"" was better than another treatment called ""Comparator B"" for people with a type of cancer called metastatic breast cancer. They looked at how many people lived a long time after treatment and how many people had a good response to the treatment.

The study found that Treatment A and Comparator B were not very different in terms of how long people lived. Both groups of people lived around 18 months on average. But more people in the Treatment A group had a good response to the treatment, with more people going into remission.

However, the study also found that Treatment A had some side effects, like making people more likely to get very sick from infections. And some people in the Treatment A group had to stop taking the treatment because it was too hard on their hearts.

So, the study showed that Treatment A was not better than Comparator B for people with metastatic breast cancer, but it did have some benefits for some people. But doctors need to be careful when using this treatment because it can have some serious side effects."
