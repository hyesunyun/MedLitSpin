Randomized trial of fenretinide to prevent second breast malignancy in women with early breast cancer",J Natl Cancer Inst,"Background:
Treatment A has been shown to inhibit breast carcinogenesis in preclinical studies. We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.
Methods:
We randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30‐70 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66‐1.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64‐1.09; P = .177) between the two arms. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs (38 in the treatment A arm versus 40 in the control arm), incidence of distant metastasis (HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.79‐1.22; P = .858), and all‐cause mortality (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.92‐1.48; P = .215).

The study was trying to figure out if a certain medicine (called Treatment A) could help prevent breast cancer from coming back in women who have already had breast cancer.

Here's what they did:

* They took 2972 women who had breast cancer and randomly assigned them to either take the medicine (Treatment A) or not take it (just get regular check-ups).
* They followed these women for 5 years to see if they got breast cancer again.
* They looked at how many women got breast cancer again in the same breast (ipsilateral) or the other breast (contralateral).
* They also looked at if the women got cancer in other parts of their body or if they died from other causes.

The results showed that:

* There was no difference between the group that took the medicine and the group that didn't take it in terms of getting breast cancer again.
* The medicine didn't seem to help prevent breast cancer from coming back.

So, the conclusion is that the medicine (Treatment A) didn't work better than just not taking it to prevent breast cancer from coming back.

That's it!"

Let me help you break it down in a way that's easy to understand!

The study was about a medicine called Treatment A, which was tested to see if it could help prevent breast cancer from coming back in women who had already had breast cancer.

The researchers took 2972 women who had had breast cancer and gave them either the medicine (Treatment A) or nothing (no treatment) for 5 years. They wanted to see if the medicine would help prevent breast cancer from coming back in either the same breast (ipsilateral) or the other breast (contralateral).

After 7 years, the researchers looked at the results and found that the medicine didn't seem to make a big difference overall. However, they did find that the medicine might have helped some women who were still having periods (premenopausal) and not helped some women who were no longer having periods (postmenopausal).

The researchers also looked at other things, like if the medicine helped prevent cancer from spreading to other parts of the body or if it helped women live longer. But they didn't find any big differences there either.

So, what does it all mean? The study suggests that Treatment A might not be a magic cure-all for preventing breast cancer from coming back, but it might be helpful for some women who are still young and having periods. However, the study is still exploratory, which"

It is uncertain whether treatment A provides additional benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. This trial was initiated to explore this question.
Patients and methods:
Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization. The two end points of interest for this study were time to treatment failure (TTF) and survival time.
Results:
Median survival was 30.0 months for chemotherapy alone and 29.3 months treatment A and chemotherapy, p=0.834. Time to treatment failure (TTF) was 13.4 months for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with 10.3 month for chemotherapy alone patients (P = .087). The response rates (complete response and partial response) was 69.2% of for patients who received chemotherapy alone and 68.9% for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy, P =.99. There was no significant difference in toxicities seen between the two arms of the study. There were four lethal toxicities.

The study also looked at how well the patients responded to the treatment. This means how much the cancer shrunk or went away. The results showed that the new treatment didn't make a big difference in this area either.

The study didn't find any big problems with the new treatment, but it did find that three patients who got the new treatment died from infections.

So, the conclusion of the study is that the new treatment isn't better than just using chemotherapy alone to treat breast cancer that has spread.

The study looked at 231 patients who had breast cancer that was either sensitive to hormones or didn't know if it was sensitive to hormones. The patients were divided into two groups: one group got chemotherapy alone, and the other group got treatment A plus chemotherapy.

The study found that the two groups had similar results in terms of how well the treatment worked. About 69% of patients in both groups had a good response to the treatment, which means their cancer didn't get worse.

The study also looked at how long it took for the cancer to come back after treatment. The patients who got treatment A plus chemotherapy had a slightly longer time before their cancer came back, but it wasn't a big difference.

The study also found that patients whose cancer was sensitive to hormones did better than patients whose cancer wasn't sensitive to hormones. But, the study didn't find that treatment A made a difference in how long patients lived overall.

Efficacy and safety of treatment A was compared with comparator B in a group of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, without previous systemic therapy for advanced breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
The study was a prospective double‐blind randomized trial. All treated patients presented with positive estrogen receptors. Main end points were response rates, toxicity profile analysis, time to progression and survival. WHO and ECOG criteria were employed for response evaluation while toxicity was assessed according to WHO guidelines. Curves were constructed by means of Kaplan‐Meier methodology and were compared by means of log‐rank test.
Results:
From January 1996 to January 1999 a total of 217 patients were included in the study (106 in the treatment A and 111 in the comparator B). Both groups of patients were homogeneous regarding the main prognostic factors. A response rate of 64% (68/106) was observed in the treatment A group as compared with a 52% (58/111) in the comparator B group. Median times to progression and overall survival were not significantly different. A lower incidence of undesirable effects was appreciated in the treatment A arm.

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy with or without treatment A primarily on disease‐free survival (DFS) and secondarily on overall survival (OS) in patients with high‐risk operable breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
From June 1997 until November 2000, 604 patients with T1‐3N1M0 or T3N0M0 tumors were randomized to three cycles of epirubicin 110 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of treatment A followed by three cycles of 'intensified' CMF (cyclophosphamide 840 mg/m2, methotrexate 47 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 840 mg/m2) (group A), or to four cycles of epirubicin followed by four cycles of CMF, as in group A (group B).

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy with or without treatment A primarily on disease‐free survival (DFS) and secondarily on overall survival (OS) in patients with high‐risk operable breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
From June 1997 until November 2000, 604 patients with T1‐3N1M0 or T3N0M0 tumors were randomized to three cycles of epirubicin 110 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of treatment A followed by three cycles of 'intensified' CMF (cyclophosphamide 840 mg/m2, methotrexate 47 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 840 mg/m2) (group A), or to four cycles of epirubicin followed by four cycles of CMF, as in group A (group B). All cycles were given every 2 weeks with granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor support.
Results:
A total of 595 patients were eligible. Median follow‐up was 61.7 months for group A and 62 months for group B. The 3‐year DFS was 80% in group A and 77% in group B. Survival rates were 93% and 90%, respectively. The effect of treatment on the hazard of death was different according to hormonal receptor status. More specifically, in patients with negative receptor status the hazard of death was significantly higher for group B (hazard ratio 2.42). Both regimens were well tolerated and severe acute side‐effects were infrequent. No cases of severe cardiotoxicity or acute leukemia were recorded.
Conclusion:
The present study failed to demonstrate a significant difference in DFS or OS between the two treatment groups. However, our study has shown clearly that treatment A can be safely incorporated to dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy.",spin,"I'd be happy to help you summarize the passage for your fifth grader!

So, the passage is talking about a study that was done to see if a certain treatment for breast cancer works better than another treatment. The study looked at two groups of patients: one group got a special combination of medicines, and the other group got a different combination of medicines.

The study found that both groups did pretty well, but there wasn't a big difference between the two groups. The study also found that the special combination of medicines (called ""treatment A"") was safe to use and didn't cause too many bad side effects.

The study didn't find that one treatment was definitely better than the other, but it did show that the special combination of medicines (treatment A) can be used safely with another treatment. That's a good thing!

So, to summarize, the study was trying to figure out which treatment is better for breast cancer, but it didn't find a clear answer. However, it did show that one treatment (treatment A) is safe to use with another treatment.

I hope that helps!"

To determine whether treatment A, improves survival in patients with brain metastases when used as an adjunct to whole‐brain radiation therapy (WBRT).
Patients and methods:
Patients with brain metastases from solid tumors and a Karnofsky performance score of > or = 70 were randomly assigned to receive WBRT with supplemental oxygen and either treatment A (treatment A arm) or no treatment (control arm). The primary end point was survival.
Results:
The study consisted of 515 eligible patients (treatment A arm, n = 265; control arm, n = 250). The median survival time (MST) was 5.4 months for the treatment A arm versus 4.4 months for the control arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87; P = .16). For the subgroup of patients with non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or breast cancer, the MST was 6.0 and 4.4 months, respectively (HR = 0.82; P = .07). Cox multiple regression analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of death for the treatment A arm in both primary populations. Further analysis indicated that the benefit may be restricted to the subgroup of patients with breast cancer. Response rates (radiographic complete response plus partial response) improved by 7% (P = .10) and 13% (P = .01) for all patients and for NSCLC and breast cancer patients in the treatment A arm, respectively. The most common severe adverse event in patients treated with treatment A was hypoxemia, which was reversible and effectively managed with supplemental oxygen in most patients.

Results:
Median treatment durations were 64 and 126 days (Arms A and B, respectively), with no significant difference in overall or disease‐free survival. Five‐year locoregional relapse‐free survival favored patients with conservative surgery (two thirds of the population), with less local and / or regional recurrence in Arm A than in Arm B (3% vs. 9%; p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis in this subgroup showed a 2.8‐fold increased risk of locoregional recurrence with comparator B, independent of other prognostic factors (p = 0.027).

The study was trying to figure out if a certain treatment (called ""Treatment A"") helps breast cancer patients who have already had chemotherapy. The researchers wanted to see if this treatment makes a difference in how long patients live without their cancer coming back.

They looked at a big group of women with breast cancer who had already had surgery and chemotherapy. Half of them got Treatment A for 3 years, and the other half didn't get any more treatment.

However, the study didn't find that Treatment A made a big difference in how long women lived overall. It's like the treatment was a small step in the right direction, but it wasn't a game-changer.

The important thing to remember is that the study was trying to be honest about what it found, but it's always a good idea to be skeptical when reading about scientific studies. Sometimes, people might try to make the results sound more exciting than they really are.

To assess whether the use of intervention A as an adjunct to colposcopy increases the detection of biopsy confirmed CIN 2, 3 (high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia).
Methods:
This is a multicenter two‐arm randomized trial comparing colposcopy alone with colposcopy plus intervention A. Patients were recruited from 13 colposcopy clinics in a variety of practice settings. 2299 women referred for the evaluation of an abnormal cervical cytology were randomized with stratification by cytology; subsequently 113 women were excluded for a variety of reasons. The main study outcomes were differences in true‐positive rates (CIN 2, 3 and cancer identified) and false‐positive rates between the study arms.
Results:
The true‐positive (TP) rates were 14.4% vs. 11.4% (p=0.035, one‐sided) for the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm compared to colposcopy‐only arm, respectively, in women with either an atypical squamous cell (ASC) or low‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) cytology result. TP rates were similar between the two arms among women referred for the evaluation of HSIL (high‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). The 26.5% gain in true‐positives observed with the use of intervention A and colposcopy among women referred for an ASC or LSIL cytology was achieved with only a fractional increase in number of biopsies obtained per patient (0.30) and a modest increase in false‐positive rate
(4%). In the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm among women with ASC or LSIL, the PPV (positive predictive value) of biopsies indicated by ntervention A was 15.0% and the PPV of biopsies indicated by colposcopy was 15.2%. Joint hypothesis testing indicates that intervention A and colposcopy provides benefit compared to colposcopy alone among women with ASC or LSIL.

So, the passage is talking about a study that tested a new treatment for breast cancer. The treatment is a combination of three medicines: doxorubicin, fluorouracil, and cyclophosphamide (let's call it ""CAF""). The study wanted to see if adding a new medicine, called ""treatment A"", to the CAF treatment would make it more effective.

The study found that the combination of CAF and treatment A did seem to work a bit better than just using CAF alone. But, the difference wasn't huge, and it wasn't statistically significant, which means it's not a proven fact. The study also found that the combination was well-tolerated, meaning that most people didn't experience serious side effects.

The study's conclusion is that the combination of CAF and treatment A might be a good option for people who haven't had any previous treatment for their breast cancer. However, the study's authors are being a bit careful with their words, because the results aren't super strong.

As for the ""spin"" part, it means that the study's authors might be trying to make the results sound more impressive than they really are. They're highlighting the positive aspects of the study, but not being entirely honest about the limitations. So, we need to be a bit skeptical and not take the results at face value.

So, the passage is talking about a study that was done to see if a new medicine (called ""Treatment A"") works better than a standard treatment (called ""CAF"") for people with breast cancer that has come back or spread.

The study looked at two groups of people: one group got the standard treatment (CAF) and a placebo (which is like a fake medicine), and the other group got the standard treatment (CAF) plus the new medicine (Treatment A).

The study found that the group that got the new medicine (Treatment A) plus the standard treatment (CAF) had a slightly higher chance of getting better (42.6% vs 53.1%), but the difference wasn't big enough to be considered ""statistically significant"". This means that the study didn't find strong evidence that the new medicine (Treatment A) is better than the standard treatment (CAF).

The study also found that the group that got the new medicine (Treatment A) plus the standard treatment (CAF) had more side effects, like neutropenia (which is a type of low white blood cell count), compared to the group that got the standard treatment (CAF) plus the placebo.

Overall, the study concluded that the new medicine (Treatment A) is not more effective than the standard treatment (CAF) for people with advanced or recurrent breast cancer.

In 1996, we initiated the multicenter phase III randomized trial to compare the effect on disease‐free survival (DFS) of experimental treatment A versus comparator B after breast‐conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer. This report presents the clinical results with a median follow‐up of 60 months.
Patients and methods:
Between February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery.
Results:
There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5‐year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis‐free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76). Nevertheless, in the node‐positive subgroup, the 5‐year LRFS was statistically better in the treatment A arm (97% in treatment A v 91% in comparator B; P = .02), corresponding to a risk of locoregional recurrence decreased by 39% (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.93).

So, a long time ago, scientists did a big study to see if a new medicine (called ""treatment A"") was better than an old medicine (called ""comparator B"") for helping people with breast cancer. They wanted to see if the new medicine could help people live longer without their cancer coming back.

They looked at a bunch of people who had breast cancer and gave them either the new medicine or the old medicine. Then, they waited for a while to see what happened.

The good news is that both medicines worked pretty well! Most people in both groups didn't have their cancer come back, and most people were still alive after 5 years. But, the new medicine seemed to work a little bit better for some people who had a higher risk of their cancer coming back.

The scientists wrote a report about their study, and they said that the new medicine might be a good option for some people with breast cancer. But, they also said that we need to be careful when we look at the results of studies like this, because sometimes scientists might try to make the results sound better than they really are.

So, that's what the passage is saying! It's a big study about a new medicine for breast cancer, and it's trying to help us understand if the medicine is really helpful or not."

They wanted to see if the new treatment helped people live longer without their cancer coming back.

They took 716 people with breast cancer and divided them into two groups. One group got the new treatment, and the other group got the old treatment. Then, they waited to see what happened to each group over time.

After 5 years, they looked at how many people in each group were still alive and didn't have their cancer come back. And what they found was that both groups did pretty well! About 80% of people in both groups were still alive and didn't have their cancer come back.

The doctors also looked at other things, like how many people had their cancer come back in the same breast or in other parts of their body. And again, they found that both groups did pretty well.

So, what does this mean? It means that the new treatment (Treatment A) wasn't better than the old treatment (Comparator B) for people with breast cancer. It's like saying that two different recipes for making cookies are both pretty good, but one isn't significantly better than the other.

So, there was a big study done on a treatment for a type of breast cancer that grows very quickly. The study looked at whether this treatment, called ""treatment A,"" was still helping people after a long time.

The study found that treatment A helped people in two ways: it made it less likely for the cancer to come back, and it made it less likely for people to die from the cancer. The study also found that some people who got treatment A had an even bigger benefit than others.

But here's the thing: the study didn't just look at the whole group of people who got treatment A. It also looked at a smaller group of people who had a certain type of cancer that was growing at a medium speed. And for those people, treatment A worked even better!

So, what does this mean? It means that treatment A is a good treatment for some people with breast cancer, especially those with medium-growing tumors. And it's good news that it can still help people even after a long time.

But, it's also important to remember that the study didn't just look at the whole group of people. It looked at a smaller group of people who had a certain type of cancer. And that's important to know when we're talking about studies and treatments.

The study found that Treatment A worked better than Comparator B in some ways. For example, more women who got Treatment A had their tumors shrink or go away, and it took longer for their cancer to come back. However, the study also found that Treatment A didn't make a big difference in how long women lived.

Treatment A is effective against HER‐2‐positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy of treatment A in HER‐2‐negative and HER‐2‐uncharacterized MBC.
Patients and methods:
Women with MBC were randomly assigned to first‐line therapy with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks plus treatment A or placebo. A preplanned retrospective evaluation of HER‐2 status was performed using fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP); secondary end points were objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), event‐free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS).

This phase III study compared the efficacy and safety of treatment A with comparator B in advanced breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
Patients were randomly assigned to treatment A or comparator B. Comparison of progression‐free survival (PFS) was the primary objective.
Results:

Overall response rate (ORR) was 32% in both arms, and overall survival (OS) was not different between arms (P = .983). Time to treatment failure (TTF; defined as discontinuation, progressive disease, death as a result of any cause, or the start of a new anticancer therapy) was superior in the treatment A arm (P = .059).

They also found that the same percentage of patients had their cancer shrink or go away (this is called ""overall response rate"").

However, the study did find some differences between the two treatments. The treatment being tested (called ""treatment A"") seemed to work better in terms of how long patients were able to keep taking the treatment without it stopping working (this is called ""time to treatment failure""). Treatment A also had fewer side effects, like diarrhea and mouth sores, compared to the other treatment (called ""comparator B"").

The study's conclusion is that treatment A might be a better option for some patients with breast cancer because it seems to work just as well as comparator B, but with fewer side effects.

As for the ""spin"" part, it means that the study's authors might be trying to make treatment A sound better than it really is by focusing on the positive results and not mentioning the negative ones. This can make it harder for people to understand the study's real findings.

2. How many people responded to the treatment (called ""overall response rate"")
3. How long people lived after starting the treatment (called ""overall survival"")

The study found that both treatments worked similarly well, and that the side effects were similar too. The only difference was that Treatment A had more problems with certain side effects, like low white blood cell count, diarrhea, and mouth sores.

Additional outcomes included: withdrawal, affect, quality of life, compliance, and side effects.
Results:
There was no main effect of treatment A vs. placebo on abstinence (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.38‐4.81, p =0.64). At week 12, the abstinence rates were 24.2% for placebo and 27.2% for treatment A; at week 27, the abstinence rates were 17.4% for placebo and 18.4% for treatment A. There was no statistically significant difference between placebo and treatment A in average daily smoking to week 12 (mean [SE] 5.2 [0.95] vs. 5.3 [1.0]; p=0.97); and to week 27 (mean [SE] 5.4 [0.88] vs. 6.1 [0.90]; p=0.64). There were no statistically significant difference between placebo and treatment A on changes in withdrawals (p=0.39); negative (p=0.41) and positive affect (p=0.77), and physical (p=0.31) and mental (p=0.42) quality of life.

So, you know how sometimes people get sick with cancer and they have to go through treatment? Well, some of those people might still smoke cigarettes even after they've been diagnosed with cancer. That's not good because smoking can make their cancer worse.

The people who wrote this study wanted to see if a special treatment could help these cancer patients quit smoking. They gave some patients a special medicine and some counseling to help them quit, and they compared it to a fake medicine (called a placebo). They wanted to see if the special medicine really worked better than the fake medicine.

The results showed that the special medicine didn't work any better than the fake medicine. About the same number of patients quit smoking with the special medicine as with the fake medicine. The study also looked at other things, like how the patients felt and how much they smoked, and it didn't find any big differences between the two groups.

So, the study concluded that the special medicine wasn't more effective than the fake medicine in helping cancer patients quit smoking. That means that maybe we need to try something else to help these patients quit smoking.

41,20087643,A bupropion smoking cessation clinical trial for cancer patients,Cancer Causes Control,"Objective:
Many cancer patients continue to smoke postdiagnosis, yet there have been few smoking cessation trials for this population. Depression, which is prevalent among cancer patients, may be a barrier to cessation.
Methods:
This double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial randomized 246 cancer patients to 9 weeks of placebo or treatment A, stratifying by pre‐treatment depression symptoms. In addition, all patients received transdermal nicotine and behavioral counseling. Primary outcomes were 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence, biochemically confirmed, at the end of treatment (Week 12), and at 6 months post quit day (Week 27). Additional outcomes included: withdrawal, affect, quality of life, compliance, and side effects.
Results:
There was no main effect of treatment A vs. placebo on abstinence (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.38‐4.81, p = 0.64). Patients with depression symptoms reported significantly lower abstinence rates vs. patients without depression symptoms (OR = .14, 95% CI: 0.02‐0.80, p=0.03). Treatment A increased abstinence rates, vs. placebo, more for participants with depression vs. those without depression symptoms. For patients with depression symptoms, treatment A reduced withdrawal symptoms and improved quality of life vs. placebo.
Conclusion:
For patients with depression symptoms, treatment increases abstinence rates, lowers withdrawal, and increases quality of life. However, abstinence rates among patients with depression symptoms were low vs. patients without depression symptoms, who exhibited similar abstinence rates when treated with treatment A or transdermal nicotine and counseling alone. These results can guide future smoking cessation intervention studies with cancer patients.",spin,"I'd be happy to help you summarize the passage for your fifth grader!

So, you know how sometimes people who have cancer might still smoke even though they know it's bad for them? Well, this study was trying to figure out if a special treatment could help them quit smoking.

The treatment was a combination of a special patch that helps people quit smoking, some counseling, and a medicine that helps with withdrawal symptoms. The researchers wanted to see if this treatment would help people quit smoking, especially people who were feeling sad or depressed.

The results showed that the treatment didn't really work for most people, but it did help people who were feeling sad or depressed. These people were more likely to quit smoking and feel better overall.

The study also found that people who were feeling sad or depressed were less likely to quit smoking than people who weren't feeling sad or depressed. This is important because it means that we need to think about how to help people who are feeling sad or depressed to quit smoking.

So, the study is saying that we need to find ways to help people who are feeling sad or depressed to quit smoking, and that the treatment they used in this study might be a good place to start.

So, the passage is talking about a study that was done to see if a new treatment (called ""treatment A"") is better than an old treatment (called ""comparator B"") for people with a type of cancer called kidney cancer.

The study found that the new treatment didn't make a big difference in how long people lived or how well they felt. In fact, the new treatment didn't even make a statistically significant difference, which means that the difference between the two treatments was too small to be important.

But here's the thing: the study did find that some people who got the new treatment had a longer period of time without their cancer getting worse. This is important because it means that the new treatment might still be helpful for some people, even if it's not better overall.

The study also found that some people who got the new treatment had serious side effects, while others who got the old treatment didn't. This is important to know because it means that doctors need to be careful when deciding which treatment to use for each patient.

So, to summarize, the study found that the new treatment didn't make a big difference overall, but it might still be helpful for some people, and doctors need to be careful when deciding which treatment to use.

So, the passage is talking about a study that was done to see if a new treatment (called ""Treatment A"") is helpful for people who have a type of cancer called Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). The study looked at how well the treatment worked and if it was safe for people to use.

The study found that the treatment did help with one problem that people with AML often have, which is a low white blood cell count. But, the study also found that the treatment didn't seem to make a big difference in how long people lived after they were diagnosed with AML.

The study did find that some people did better than others, though. For example, women who had AML did better than men who had AML. The study also found that people who only needed one round of treatment to get rid of their cancer did better than people who needed more rounds of treatment.

The passage also talks about something called ""spin"" which is when someone tries to make a study look more important or helpful than it really is. The passage is saying that we should be careful when reading about studies and not just take what we read at face value.

So, to summarize, the study found that the new treatment might be helpful for some people with AML, but it's not a magic cure and more research is needed to understand how it works."

A two‐arm, double‐blind, randomized trial was performed to evaluate the effect of treatment A on acute skin‐related toxicity in patients undergoing breast or chest wall radiotherapy.
Methods and material:
Patients with ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast carcinoma who were undergoing external beam radiotherapy to the breast or chest wall were randomly assigned to apply treatment A or placebo cream daily. The primary study endpoint was the provider assessed maximal grade of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, radiation dermatitis.
Results:
A total of 176 patients were enrolled between September 21, 2007, and December 7, 2007. The provider assessed primary endpoint showed no difference in the mean maximum grade of radiation dermatitis by treatment arm (1.2+/‐0.85 for treatment A vs. 1.3+/‐0.80 for placebo; p = .18).

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment A in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer (OC).
Methods:
Patients with platinum‐refractory or ‐resistant primary or secondary) OC were randomized to receive treatment A and PLD at 50 mg/m2 intravenously or PLD alone at 50 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 every 28 days until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression‐free survival (PFS). Other end points were objective response rate and safety. The study was originally planned for 244 patients. The trial was temporarily placed on hold after 125 patients were randomized while the results of another trial were being reviewed and the sponsor decided not to resume enrollment. The interim analysis became the final analysis.
Results:
The median PFS was 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD (n = 65) versus 3.7 months for PLD (n = 60) (hazards ratio, 0.92; P = 0.7243). A preplanned subgroup analysis showed that 75 patients with platinum‐refractory or primary platinum‐resistant OC had a median PFS of 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD versus 2.9 months for PLD (hazards ratio, 0.55; P = 0.0425). Hematologic adverse events were 66% on the treatment A + PLD arm versus 44% on the PLD arm, manageable with dose reductions. Nonhematologic adverse events were similar for both arms. The incidence of palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis was lower on treatment A + PLD (23%, 31%, respectively) versus (39%, 49%, respectively) on PLD.
Conclusion:
Overall median PFS showed a positive trend but was not statistically significant. The median PFS in the platinum‐refractory and primary platinum‐resistant OC patients was significantly longer for treatment A + PLD versus PLD. Treatment A may ameliorate the palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis known to be associated with PLD.

So, the passage is talking about a study that was done to see if a new treatment (called ""treatment A"") works better when it's combined with another medicine (called ""pegylated liposomal doxorubicin"" or PLD) to help people with a type of cancer called ovarian cancer.

The study looked at how well the treatment worked in two groups of people: one group got the new treatment and the other group got the PLD medicine alone. They wanted to see how long it took for the cancer to come back in each group.

The results showed that the group that got the new treatment and the PLD medicine together had a slightly longer time before the cancer came back compared to the group that just got the PLD medicine alone. However, the difference wasn't big enough to be considered ""statistically significant,"" which means that it's not clear if the new treatment really made a difference.

The study also found that the new treatment might help reduce some of the side effects that people get from taking the PLD medicine, like redness and numbness in their hands and feet, and sores in their mouth.

Overall, the study suggests that the new treatment might be a good option for people with ovarian cancer who have already tried other treatments and haven't worked. But more research is needed to confirm these findings.

So, the passage is talking about a study that tested a new treatment for a type of cancer called ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer is a type of cancer that affects women's ovaries.

The study was trying to figure out if a new treatment, called ""Treatment A"", works better when it's combined with another medicine called pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (which is a mouthful, I know!). The study looked at how well the treatment worked in women who had ovarian cancer that didn't respond to other treatments.

The results of the study showed that the treatment didn't work much better when it was combined with the other medicine. In fact, the study found that the treatment worked about the same whether it was used alone or with the other medicine.

The study also looked at some side effects of the treatment, like nausea, fatigue, and hair loss. The study found that some of these side effects were more common when the treatment was used with the other medicine.

Overall, the study concluded that the new treatment, Treatment A, doesn't work much better when it's combined with the other medicine, and that it's not a better option for women with ovarian cancer.

This phase III trial assesses whether treatment A increases the duration of functional independence after surgery or radiosurgery of brain metastases.
Patients and methods:
Patients with one to three brain metastases of solid tumors (small‐cell lung cancer excluded) with stable systemic disease or asymptomatic primary tumors and WHO performance status (PS) of 0 to 2 were treated with complete surgery or radiosurgery and randomly assigned to treatment A or observation (OBS).

Patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagogastric junction (AEG II and III) were randomly assigned to treatment A followed by surgery or to surgery alone. To detect with 80% power an improvement in median survival from 17 months with surgery alone to 24 months with treatment A, 282 events were required.
Results:
This trial was stopped for poor accrual after 144 patients were randomly assigned (72:72); 52.8% patients had tumors located in the proximal third of the stomach, including AEG type II and III.

Questionnaires were completed at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks. A total of 227 patients were randomized into this study between March 19, 2004, and March 9, 2007. Twenty‐three patients withdrew before starting the study treatment. Primary end‐point data were available on 119 patients (62 receiving treatment A and 57 receiving placebo). Baseline characteristics and baseline patient reported outcomes were well balanced between arms. The AUC over the 8 weeks for treatment A was 51.4 (SD = 16 and for placebo was 49.7 (SD = 15), with a P value of 0.7. The FOSQ was not statistically significantly different between groups. There was no statistically significant difference between groups for the POMS week 8 treatment A 6.9 vs. placebo 6.0; p=0.90. For the BFI at week 8 the treatment A and placebo arm scored respectively for fatigue now 22.1 vs. 10.5; p<0.01; for usual fatigue 19.4 vs. 10.0; p=0.05; for worst fatigue 14.8 vs. 12.4; p=0.65; and for activity inference 12.3 vs. 10.8; p=0.75.There were no significant differences in toxicities as measured by self‐report or the CTCAE. Treatment A was not more effective than placebo on sleep quality in patients who were undergoing cancer treatment.",no_spin,"So, you know how sometimes people who have cancer might have trouble sleeping? This study was trying to find a new way to help them sleep better.

They took 227 people who were going through cancer treatment and gave them either a new medicine or a fake medicine (called a placebo). They wanted to see if the new medicine helped them sleep better.

After 8 weeks, they looked at how well the people were sleeping and how they were feeling. They found that the new medicine didn't really help people sleep better than the fake medicine. In fact, the people who took the fake medicine actually reported feeling less tired and having less fatigue than the people who took the new medicine!

The study also looked at other things, like how people were feeling emotionally and physically, and they didn't find any big differences between the two groups.

So, the study didn't find that the new medicine was helpful for people with cancer who have trouble sleeping."
5,21471562,"Impact of a novel nurse-led prechemotherapy education intervention (ChemoEd) on patient distress, symptom burden, and treatment-related information and support needs: results from a randomised, controlled trial",Ann Oncol,"Background: 
High levels of distress and need for self‐care information by patients commencing chemotherapy suggest that current prechemotherapy education is suboptimal. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of a prechemotherapy education intervention (treatment A) to assess impact on patient distress, treatment‐related concerns, and the prevalence and severity of and bother caused by six chemotherapy side‐effects.
Patients and methods:
One hundred and ninety‐two breast, gastrointestinal, and haematologic cancer patients were recruited before the trial closing prematurely (original target 352). Treatment A was administered before first treatment (intervention 1), 48 h after first treatment (intervention 2), and immediately before second treatment (intervention 3). Patient outcomes were measured at baseline (T1: pre‐education) and immediately preceding treatment cycles 1 (T2) and 3 (T3).
Results:
Treatment A did not significantly reduce patient distress. However, a significant decrease in sensory/psychological (P=0.027) and procedural (P=0.03) concerns, as well as prevalence and severity of and bother due to vomiting (all P=0.001), were observed at T3. In addition, subgroup analysis of patients with elevated distress at T1 indicated a significant decrease (P=0.035) at T2 but not at T3 (P=0.055) in treatment A patients.
Conclusion:
Treatment A holds promise to improve patient treatment‐related concerns and some physical/psychological outcomes; however, further research is required on more diverse patient populations to ensure generalisability.",spin,"I'd be happy to help you summarize the passage for your fifth grader!

So, the passage is talking about a study that was done to see if a special kind of education (called ""Treatment A"") could help people who are about to start chemotherapy feel less stressed and worried. Chemotherapy is a big deal, and it can make people feel really sick and scared.

The study found that Treatment A didn't really help people feel less stressed overall. But, it did help people feel less worried about some specific things, like getting sick to their stomach or feeling uncomfortable during the treatment.

The study also found that some people who were really worried at the beginning of the study started to feel a little better after getting Treatment A. But, the study didn't find that it helped everyone, and it didn't find that it helped people feel better in all the ways they were hoping.

So, the study is saying that Treatment A might be helpful for some people, but we need to do more research to make sure it works for lots of different people and to figure out why it works for some people but not others.

Does that make sense?"

So, you know how sometimes people have to go to the doctor and get treated for something, like cancer? And sometimes that treatment can make them feel really sick or uncomfortable? Well, this study was trying to figure out if giving people some extra information and education before they start their treatment can help them feel better.

The study looked at 192 people who had cancer and were about to start getting chemotherapy. They gave some of these people extra information and education before they started treatment, and then they compared how they felt to a group of people who didn't get the extra information.

The study found that the extra information didn't really help people feel better. In fact, the people who got the extra information didn't have any less stress or discomfort than the people who didn't get it. The only thing that was slightly better was that the people who got the extra information were a little less worried about some of the side effects of the treatment.

So, the study concluded that giving people extra information and education before they start chemotherapy doesn't really make a big difference in how they feel. It's like trying to put a Band-Aid on a boo-boo, but the boo-boo is still there!

Treatment A, has activity alone and in combination with docetaxel (Taxotere) and prednisone (DP) in metastatic castration‐resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). A randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled phase II trial compared DP combined with either treatment A (A) or placebo in chemonaive mCRPC.
Patients and methods:
Men with progressive mCRPC despite androgen deprivation were eligible and randomized 1:1. Patients received docetaxel (75 mg/m2 day 1) and prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily every 21 days with either treatment A or placebo twice daily orally on days 1‐3. The primary end point was overall survival (OS).
Results:
Two hundred and twenty‐one patients were randomly assigned. Median OS for treatment A plus docetaxel‐prednisone (ADP) and placebo‐DP was 18.1 versus 17.8 months [hazard ratio (HR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.72‐1.55, P=0.63].

So, the passage is talking about a study that tested a new treatment for a type of cancer called prostate cancer. The treatment is called ""Treatment A"" and it was tested along with two other medicines, docetaxel and prednisone.

The study looked at how well the treatment worked compared to a placebo (which is like a fake treatment). The researchers wanted to see if the treatment could help people with prostate cancer live longer.

The results of the study showed that the treatment didn't make a big difference in how long people lived. The people who got the treatment lived for about 18 months, and the people who got the placebo lived for about 17 months. That's not a big difference!

The study also looked at some side effects of the treatment, like heart problems, low white blood cell count, and lung problems. The treatment seemed to cause more of these side effects than the placebo.

The researchers did find that the treatment might have worked a little better for some people who had a more serious type of prostate cancer. But overall, the treatment didn't seem to be very effective.

So, the study is saying that the treatment is okay, but it's not a game-changer for people with prostate cancer. And that's important to know!

A phase III study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) to evaluate the effect on response rate and survival of a treatment A.
Patients and methods:
Four hundred fifty‐six patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B in combination with 5‐FU (500 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) i.v., every 21 days for a maximum of six cycles (eight in case of CR).
Results:
Of 456 patients, 390 were evaluable for efficacy. Objective response (CR + PR) was seen in 57% (treatment A) vs. 41% (comparator B) of the evaluable patients (P = 0.003). The CR rate was higher in the treatment A arm (12% vs. 7%, P = 0.07). Treatment A produced significantly higher response rates in patients with visceral localization (50% vs. 34%, P = 0.011) and in patients with more than two metastatic organ sites (64% vs. 37%, P = 0.001). Median time to progression (7.6 vs. 7 months) and overall survival (18 months vs. 17 months) were similar. Myelosuppression was the principal toxic effect, with grade IV neutropenia observed in 57% of the patients treated with treatment A vs. 9% of those on comparator B. Grade IV infection or febrile neutropenia were observed in 8% (treatment A) vs. 0.4% (comparator B), but the incidence of septic death was the same in the two arms (two patients each). Cardiac toxicity was similar in the two treatment groups, with 5% vs. 3% of the patients taken off study due to cardiac events, primarily due to a decline in LVEF. Only three patients (two in treatment A) experienced congestive heart failure.

So, the passage is talking about a study that was done to test a new treatment for breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. The treatment is called ""treatment A"", and it was compared to another treatment called ""comparator B"".

The study found that treatment A worked better than comparator B in some ways. For example, more people who got treatment A had their cancer shrink or go away completely. Treatment A also worked better for people who had cancer in their organs, like their liver or lungs.

However, treatment A also had some side effects that were worse than comparator B. For example, more people who got treatment A had problems with their blood cells, which can make them feel tired or sick. Some people even had to stop taking the treatment because of these side effects.

The study also found that treatment A didn't make people live longer than comparator B. So, while treatment A might be a good option for some people, it's not necessarily the best choice for everyone.

It's also important to note that the study was written in a way that might make it sound like treatment A is better than it really is. This is called ""spin"", and it's something that scientists try to avoid when writing about their studies.

So, to summarize, treatment A is a new treatment for breast cancer that works better than comparator B in some ways, but it also has some side effects that"

So, the passage is talking about a study that was done to test a new treatment for breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. The treatment is called ""Treatment A"", and it was compared to another treatment called ""Comparator B"".

The study looked at two main things: how well the treatments worked, and how long the patients lived. The results showed that both treatments worked similarly well, and the patients lived for about the same amount of time (around 17-18 months).

The study also looked at some side effects of the treatments. Treatment A caused more problems with the blood cells (like neutropenia) and the heart, but not more problems with the cancer itself.

The conclusion of the study is that Treatment A is not better than Comparator B for treating breast cancer. This means that doctors might not choose Treatment A over Comparator B for their patients.
