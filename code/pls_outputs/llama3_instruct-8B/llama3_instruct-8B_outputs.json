We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.\nMethods:\nWe randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30\u201070 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two\u2010sided.\nResults:\n2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66\u20101.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64\u20101.09; P = .177) between the two arms. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs (38 in the treatment A arm versus 40 in the control arm), incidence of distant metastasis (HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.79\u20101.22; P = .858), and all\u2010cause mortality (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.92\u20101.48; P = .215).\nConclusion:\nTreatment A was not more effective than no treatment in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.",

This study wanted to see if taking this new medicine, Treatment A, could help prevent that from happening.\n\nThe study looked at 2972 women who had already had breast cancer, and they divided them into two groups. One group took the medicine, and the other group didn't take anything. They followed these women for 7 years to see if any of them got breast cancer again.\n\nThe results showed that taking the medicine didn't make a difference. Just as many women in the group that took the medicine got breast cancer again as women in the group that didn't take anything.

Between January 1997 and January 2002, 211 consecutive patients with T2\u20104, N0\u20101, M0 breast cancer were randomized to receive either epirubicin alone (EPI) or epirubicin plus treatment A. Ki67 expression was evaluated immunohistochemically in tumor specimens obtained before chemotherapy by incision biopsy and at definitive surgery. Tumor shrinkage of >50% was obtained in 76% of patients randomized in the EPI arm and 81.9% of patients randomized in the EPI+treatment A arm (not significant). The corresponding rates of clinical and pathological complete response were 20.2 and 21.9% (not significant), and 4.8 and 6.7% (not significant), respectively. Pathologically complete response was more frequently observed in estrogen receptor (ER)\u2010negative (ER\u2010) tumors (P=0.04) and correlated with elevated baseline Ki67 expression (P<0.01). Both EPI treatment and EPI+treatment A resulted in a significant reduction in Ki67 expression, either in overall patients (P=0.000) or in patients with ER+ breast cancer (P=0.000). The reduction in Ki67 immunostaining in the EPI+treatment A arm was greater than in the EPI arm, leading to a lower Ki67 expression at post\u2010operative residual histology (P=0.0041). The addition of treatment A to epirubicin chemotherapy did not improve the response rate but led to a significantly higher reduction in the Ki67 expression. Baseline elevated Ki67 expression and the ER\u2010 statuses were both associated with a greater chance of obtaining a pathological complete response at residual histology.",

TP rates were similar between the two arms among women referred for the evaluation of HSIL (high\u2010grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). The 26.5% gain in true\u2010positives observed with the use of intervention A and colposcopy among women referred for an ASC or LSIL cytology was achieved with only a fractional increase in number of biopsies obtained per patient (0.30) and a modest increase in false\u2010positive rate\n(4%). In the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm among women with ASC or LSIL, the PPV (positive predictive value) of biopsies indicated by ntervention A was 15.0% and the PPV of biopsies indicated by colposcopy was 15.2%. Joint hypothesis testing indicates that intervention A and colposcopy provides benefit compared to colposcopy alone among women with ASC or LSIL.\nConclusion:\nCombining intervention A with colposcopy provides a clinically meaningful increase in the detection of CIN 2, 3 in women referred for the evaluation of mildly abnormal cytology results.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:\nThis phase III randomized open\u2010label clinical trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment A versus comparator B as first\u2010line treatment for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in postmenopausal women.\nPatients and methods:\nThe study was conducted at 81 centers and enrolled postmenopausal patients with measurable hormone\u2010sensitive metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer. Prior adjuvant chemotherapy and/or comparator B were allowed. One previous chemotherapy regimen and no prior hormone therapy for advanced disease were permitted. Patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment A or comparator B until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred.\nResults:\nA total of 371 patients enrolled at 79 sites (182 treatment A, 189 comparator B) were included in the analysis. Both treatments were generally well tolerated without major toxicity. Overall response rate was greater for treatment A than for comparator B (46% v 31%; odds ratio = 1.85; 95% CI, 1.21 to 2.82; P = .005). Median progression\u2010free survival (PFS) was longer with treatment A (9.9 months; 95% CI, 8.7 to 11.8 months) than with comparator B (5.8 months; 95% CI, 5.3 to 8.1 months). However, these early differences (Wilcoxon P = .028) did not translate to a longer\u2010term benefit in PFS, the primary study end point (log\u2010rank P = .121). There was also no difference in survival between both study arms.\nConclusion:\nTreatment A is an effective and well\u2010tolerated first\u2010line hormonal treatment for postmenopausal women with MBC and offers significant early improvement in time to tumor progression when compared with comparator B.",

The treatments are called \"Treatment A\" and \"Comparator B\".\n\nThe study wanted to see which treatment worked better and was safer for the women. They looked at how well the treatments worked by checking how long it took for the cancer to come back or spread, and also how well the women felt while taking the treatments.\n\nThe results showed that Treatment A worked better than Comparator B in some ways. It made the cancer go away or shrink more often, and it took longer for the cancer to come back. However, in the long run, both treatments ended up having the same effect on how long the women lived.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that Treatment A is a good option for women with breast cancer who are no longer having periods, because it works well and is safe. It's not perfect, but it's a good choice.\n\nYou could also explain to your child that this study is important because it helps doctors and scientists learn more about how to treat breast cancer, and it can help them make better decisions about which treatments to use for their patients."

Although numerous prescription hypnotics are available, few are approved for long\u2010term use or have demonstrated benefit in this circumstance. Hypnotics may have unwanted side effects and are costly, and cancer survivors often wish to avoid prescription drugs. New options with limited side effects are needed. The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of treatment A for sleep in people with cancer who were undergoing cancer treatment. Participants were randomized to receive treatment A or placebo orally 1 hour before bedtime for 8 weeks. The primary end point was area under the curve (AUC) of the overall Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Secondary outcomes included the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Toxicity was evaluated with both self\u2010reported numeric analogue scale questions and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0. Questionnaires were completed at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks. A total of 227 patients were randomized into this study between March 19, 2004, and March 9, 2007, with 119 being evaluable for the primary end point. The AUC over the 8 weeks for treatment A was 51.4 (SD = 16), while that for placebo was 49.7 (SD = 15), with a P value of 0.6957. A supplemental, exploratory analysis revealed that several fatigue end points, as measured by the BFI and POMS, were significantly better for those taking treatment A over placebo. Participants also reported less trouble with sleep and less drowsiness on treatment A than placebo. There were no significant differences in toxicities as measured by self\u2010report or the CTCAE except for mild alkaline phosphatase increases, which were slightly more common in the placebo group. This study failed to provide data to support the hypothesis that treatment A, at bedtime could improve sleep as measured by the PSQI.

        "abstract": "Sleep disorders are a substantial problem for cancer survivors, with prevalence estimates ranging from 23% to 61%. Although numerous prescription hypnotics are available, few are approved for long\u2010term use or have demonstrated benefit in this circumstance. Hypnotics may have unwanted side effects and are costly, and cancer survivors often wish to avoid prescription drugs. New options with limited side effects are needed. The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of a treatment A for sleep in people with cancer who were undergoing cancer treatment. Participants were randomized to receive treatment A or placebo orally 1 hour before bedtime for 8 weeks. The primary end point was area under the curve (AUC) of the overall Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Secondary outcomes included the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Toxicity was evaluated with both self\u2010reported numeric analogue scale questions and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0. Questionnaires were completed at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks. A total of 227 patients were randomized into this study between March 19, 2004, and March 9, 2007. Twenty\u2010three patients withdrew before starting the study treatment. Primary end\u2010point data were available on 119 patients (62 receiving treatment A and 57 receiving placebo). Baseline characteristics and baseline patient reported outcomes were well balanced between arms. The AUC over the 8 weeks for treatment A was 51.4 (SD = 16 and for placebo was 49.7 (SD = 15), with a P value of 0.7. The FOSQ was not statistically significantly different between groups. There was no statistically significant difference between groups for the POMS week 8 treatment A 6.9 vs. placebo 6.0; p=0.90. For the BFI at week 8 the treatment A and placebo arm scored respectively for fatigue now 22.1 vs. 10.5; p<0.01; for usual fatigue 19.4 vs. 10.0; p=0.05; for worst fatigue 14.8 vs. 12.4; p=0.65; and for activity inference 12.3 vs. 10.8; p=0.75.There were no significant differences in toxicities as measured by self\u2010report or the CTCAE. Treatment A was not more effective than placebo on sleep quality in patients who were undergoing cancer treatment.",

Well, this passage is talking about people who have had cancer and are still going through treatment. They might have trouble sleeping too, and it's a big problem for them.\n\nThe people who wrote this passage were trying to find a new way to help these people sleep better. They tested a special medicine, called \"treatment A\", to see if it would help.
