Randomized trial of fenretinide to prevent second breast malignancy in women with early breast cancer",J Natl Cancer Inst,"Background:
Treatment A has been shown to inhibit breast carcinogenesis in preclinical studies. We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.
Methods:
We randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30‐70 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66‐1.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64‐1.09; P = .177) between the two arms. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs (38 in the treatment A arm versus 40 in the control arm), incidence of distant metastasis (HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.79‐1.22; P = .858), and all‐cause mortality (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.92‐1.48; P = .215).
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than no treatment in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.",no_spin,"Here's a summary for a fifth grader:
This study looked at a medicine called Treatment A to see if it could prevent a second breast cancer from happening in women who already had their first breast cancer (stage I or ductal carcinoma in situ) removed by surgery. The researchers gave Treatment A (200 mg daily as an oral pill) to 1,496 women for 5 years, while another 1,476 women didn't receive any special treatment (the control group). Both groups were monitored equally, and the doctors checking mammograms didn't know who got Treatment A or not.
The main goal was to compare how many women in each group developed new breast cancers (either in the opposite breast - contralateral - or the same breast - ipsilateral) 7 years after they were assigned to their groups. They used special math (Cox regression) to analyze the results.
After about 8 years and 3 months of observation (median 97 months), they found no significant difference in new breast cancers between the Treatment A group and the control group. For example, there were 65 contralateral breast cancers in the Treatment A group and 71 in the control group - not a big difference. The same was true for ipsilateral breast cancers and cancers in other organs or distant metastasis (cancer spreading). There was also no difference in overall death rates between the groups.
So, the conclusion is that Treatment A did not prove to be more effective than no treatment in"

This study looked at a medicine called Treatment A to see if it could prevent a second breast cancer from happening in women who already had their first breast cancer removed (stage I or ductal carcinoma in situ). The researchers gave Treatment A (200 mg daily as an oral pill) to one group of 1,972 women (ages 30-70) for 5 years, while another similar group didn't receive this treatment. They checked for new breast cancers (in the same breast - ipsilateral, or opposite breast - contralateral) 7 years after assigning treatments.

The main result: There was no significant difference in preventing second breast cancers overall between the group taking Treatment A and the group without it. However, when they looked at women based on whether they were premenopausal (not yet gone through menopause) or postmenopausal (already gone through menopause), they found something interesting. For premenopausal women, Treatment A might have a beneficial effect (lower risk) for both contralateral and ipsilateral breast cancers, but for postmenopausal women, it might have an opposite effect (higher risk).

Important note: The study's main conclusion is that Treatment A doesn't show a significant overall benefit in preventing second breast cancers, but there might be a subgroup effect (in premenopausal women) that needs further confirmation.

It is uncertain whether treatment A provides additional benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. This trial was initiated to explore this question.
Patients and methods:
Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization. The two end points of interest for this study were time to treatment failure (TTF) and survival time.
Results:
Median survival was 30.0 months for chemotherapy alone and 29.3 months treatment A and chemotherapy, p=0.834. Time to treatment failure (TTF) was 13.4 months for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with 10.3 month for chemotherapy alone patients (P = .087). The response rates (complete response and partial response) was 69.2% of for patients who received chemotherapy alone and 68.9% for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy, P =.99. There was no significant difference in toxicities seen between the two arms of the study. There were four lethal toxicities. Three infectious deaths occurred in patients receiving treatment A with chemotherapy.
Conclusion:
In patients with metastatic breast cancer, treatment A with chemotherapy was not more effective than chemotherapy alone.",no_spin,"Here's a simple explanation for your fifth grader:

This study looked at two ways to treat metastatic breast cancer (cancer that has spread beyond the breast) in 231 patients between 1988 and 1992. One group received just chemotherapy, while the other group received ""treatment A"" combined with chemotherapy. Treatment A is not specified by name here, but it's an additional therapy being tested alongside chemotherapy.

The researchers checked two main outcomes: how long it took for the treatment to stop working (time to treatment failure, or TTF) and overall survival time. They found that:
- Median survival time was almost the same for both groups: 30 months for chemotherapy alone and 29.3 months for treatment A plus chemotherapy.
- Time to treatment failure was slightly longer for treatment A plus chemotherapy (13.4 months) compared to chemotherapy alone (10.3 months), but this difference wasn't statistically significant (meaning it could be due to chance).
- The response rates (how well the cancer shrank) were nearly identical for both groups, at 69.2% for chemotherapy alone and 68.9% for treatment A plus chemotherapy.
- Both treatments had similar side effects, including four lethal toxicities, with three of these occurring in patients receiving treatment A with chemotherapy.

The conclusion is that, for patients with metastatic breast cancer, adding treatment A to chemotherapy did not provide any significant advantage over chemotherapy alone. This study's findings are presented straightforwardly"

It is uncertain whether treatment A provides additional benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. This trial was initiated to explore this question.
Patients and methods:
Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with estrogen receptor (ER)‐positive or ER‐unknown metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization.
Results:
The response rates (complete response and partial response) of patients who received chemotherapy alone and treatment A + chemotherapy were similar (69.2% v 68.9%, respectively; P =.99). Time to treatment failure (TTF) was slightly longer for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone patients (13.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.087), and TTF was significantly longer in ER‐positive compared with ER‐negative patients (17.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.048). However, ER status had no effect on overall survival (30.0 months for chemotherapy alone v 29.3 months for treatment A + chemotherapy).
Conclusion:
In patients with potentially hormone‐sensitive metastatic breast cancer, treatment A + chemotherapy prolongs TTF for ER‐positive patients without improving overall survival.",spin,"Here's a simplified explanation for a fifth grader:

This study looked at two ways to treat metastatic breast cancer (cancer that has spread) in patients whose cancer cells respond to estrogen (ER-positive) or where that response is unknown. They compared ""chemotherapy alone"" (strong medicines to kill cancer cells) to ""treatment A plus chemotherapy"" (an additional therapy combined with those strong medicines).

From January 1988 to December 1992, 231 patients were randomly assigned to one of these two treatments. The researchers checked how well each treatment worked by looking at response rates (how many patients' cancer got smaller or disappeared) and time to treatment failure (how long before the cancer started growing again).

The study found that both treatments had similar response rates (about 69% for both). However, patients who received treatment A plus chemotherapy had slightly longer times before their cancer started growing again (13.4 months vs 10.3 months). This difference was more noticeable for ER-positive patients (17.4 months vs 10.3 months for ER-negative patients). But importantly, neither treatment improved overall survival (how long patients lived) - both groups lived about 30 months.

The ""spin"" in this abstract refers to potentially misleading emphasis. Here, it might be overstating the benefit of treatment A by focusing on the longer time to treatment failure for ER-positive patients, while not improving overall survival. So, we should be cautious when interpreting these results.

Efficacy and safety of treatment A was compared with comparator B in a group of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, without previous systemic therapy for advanced breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
The study was a prospective double‐blind randomized trial. All treated patients presented with positive estrogen receptors. Main end points were response rates, toxicity profile analysis, time to progression and survival. WHO and ECOG criteria were employed for response evaluation while toxicity was assessed according to WHO guidelines. Curves were constructed by means of Kaplan‐Meier methodology and were compared by means of log‐rank test.
Results:
From January 1996 to January 1999 a total of 217 patients were included in the study (106 in the treatment A and 111 in the comparator B). Both groups of patients were homogeneous regarding the main prognostic factors. A response rate of 64% (68/106) was observed in the treatment A group as compared with a 52% (58/111) in the comparator B group. Median times to progression and overall survival were not significantly different. A lower incidence of undesirable effects was appreciated in the treatment A arm.
Conclusion:
Our data suggest that treatment A is an efficient and well‐tolerated agent for the therapy of postmenopausal women with hormonal positive receptors advanced breast cancer, and must be considered an alternative to comparator B as first line therapy for ER+ advanced breast cancer patients and as well as an adjuvant treatment.",spin,"Here's a simplified explanation for a fifth grader:

This study compared two treatments, called A and B, for postmenopausal women (women who've stopped having periods) with advanced breast cancer that responds to estrogen (ER+ cancer). Neither group of women had received prior systemic therapy (whole-body treatments like chemotherapy) for their advanced breast cancer. 

The researchers did a special kind of test called a ""double-blind randomized trial"" to make sure the results were fair. They looked at how well each treatment worked (response rates), side effects (toxicity), time until the cancer progressed, and overall survival. They used specific rules (WHO and ECOG criteria) to measure these things.

From 1996 to 1999, 217 women participated: 106 got treatment A, and 111 got treatment B. Both groups were similar in important factors that affect how well they'd do. Treatment A helped 64% of its group, while treatment B helped 52%. However, the time until cancer progressed and overall survival were about the same for both groups. Treatment A had fewer bad side effects.

The conclusion is that treatment A is effective and easier to tolerate for postmenopausal women with ER+ advanced breast cancer. It could be considered as an alternative to treatment B for first-line therapy (the first treatment tried) or as an additional treatment.

- The researchers randomly assigned 400 women to either Treatment A or Comparator B, like flipping a coin to decide which group each woman joins.
- They looked at several important outcomes, such as:

  2. Time to Treatment Failure (TTF): how long before the treatment stops working.
  3. Objective Response (OR) rate: the percentage of women whose cancer shrinks.
  4. Duration of Response (DOR): how long the cancer stays smaller after it shrinks.
  5. Tolerability: how well the women handle side effects.

Here's what they found:
- Treatment A didn't slow down cancer growth more than Comparator B (TTP and TTF were similar).
- Both treatments helped shrink the cancer in about 17.5% of the women (OR rate).
- However, Treatment A kept the cancer smaller for a longer time compared to Comparator B (DOR was better for Treatment A).
- Both treatments were well tolerated, meaning women didn't experience severe side effects.

The main findings:
- Both treatments led to significant tumor shrinkage (over 50% in most cases), but there was no significant difference between the two groups.
- Complete response rates (no remaining cancer) were similar for both groups, too.
- However, adding treatment A led to a greater reduction in Ki67 expression, meaning it slowed down cancer cell growth more than epirubicin alone.
- Tumors without estrogen receptors (ER-negative) and those with high initial Ki67 expression responded better to treatment (more complete responses).

From June 1997 until November 2000, 604 patients with T1‐3N1M0 or T3N0M0 tumors were randomized to three cycles of epirubicin 110 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of treatment A followed by three cycles of 'intensified' CMF (cyclophosphamide 840 mg/m2, methotrexate 47 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 840 mg/m2) (group A), or to four cycles of epirubicin followed by four cycles of CMF, as in group A (group B). All cycles were given every 2 weeks with granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor support.
Results:
A total of 595 patients were eligible. Median follow‐up was 61.7 months for group A and 62 months for group B. DFS and OS did not differ significantly between treatment groups (log‐rank P = 0.55 and P = 0.38, respectively). The 3‐year DFS was 80% in group A and 77% in group B. Survival rates were 93% and 90%, respectively. Comparison of quality of life outcomes between the two groups showed no statistically significant differences. Both regimens were well tolerated and severe acute side‐effects were infrequent. No cases of severe cardiotoxicity or acute leukemia were recorded.
Conclusion:
Treatment A with a dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy was not more effective than a dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy alone in patients with high‐risk operable breast cancer.",no_spin,"Here's a simplified explanation for a fifth grader:

This study looked at two different chemotherapy plans for women with high-risk, operable breast cancer (meaning the cancer can be surgically removed). Both plans involved strong medicines given in cycles, with each cycle spaced 2 weeks apart. The main difference was that one group (Group A) received an extra treatment, called ""treatment A,"" alongside standard chemotherapy drugs (epirubicin and CMF), while the other group (Group B) only received the standard chemotherapy drugs without treatment A.

The researchers wanted to see if adding treatment A would improve two main outcomes: 1) disease-free survival (DFS), which means staying cancer-free after treatment, and 2) overall survival (OS), which means living longer regardless of cancer recurrence.

After following 595 patients for about 61-62 months, the study found that there was no significant difference in DFS or OS between the two groups. In simpler terms, adding treatment A did not make a big enough difference to show it was better than just using the standard chemotherapy drugs alone. Both groups had similar rates of staying cancer-free and overall survival. The study also found that both treatments were generally well-tolerated, with few severe side effects.

So, the conclusion is that, for high-risk operable breast cancer patients, adding treatment A to the standard chemotherapy regimen did not provide a significant advantage in terms of disease-free survival or overall survival compared to using the standard chemotherapy alone."

They divided 604 patients into two groups: Group A received epirubicin, then treatment A, followed by intensified CMF (a mix of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil); Group B received only epirubicin followed by CMF, without treatment A. Both groups got their treatments every 2 weeks, with extra medicine to help protect their white blood cells.

To determine whether treatment A, improves survival in patients with brain metastases when used as an adjunct to whole‐brain radiation therapy (WBRT).
Patients and methods:
Patients with brain metastases from solid tumors and a Karnofsky performance score of > or = 70 were randomly assigned to receive WBRT with supplemental oxygen and either treatment A (treatment A arm) or no treatment (control arm). The primary end point was survival.
Results:
The study consisted of 515 eligible patients (treatment A arm, n = 265; control arm, n = 250). The median survival time (MST) was 5.4 months for the treatment A arm versus 4.4 months for the control arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87; P = .16). For the subgroup of patients with non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or breast cancer, the MST was 6.0 and 4.4 months, respectively (HR = 0.82; P = .07). Cox multiple regression analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of death for the treatment A arm in both primary populations. Further analysis indicated that the benefit may be restricted to the subgroup of patients with breast cancer. Response rates (radiographic complete response plus partial response) improved by 7% (P = .10) and 13% (P = .01) for all patients and for NSCLC and breast cancer patients in the treatment A arm, respectively. The most common severe adverse event in patients treated with treatment A was hypoxemia, which was reversible and effectively managed with supplemental oxygen in most patients.

This study looked at whether adding ""treatment A"" to standard whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) helps people live longer when they have cancer that has spread to their brain (brain metastases). The patients in this study had solid tumors (like lung or breast cancer) and were fairly active (Karnofsky score 70 or above). They were divided randomly into two groups: one got WBRT plus treatment A, and the other got WBRT alone (the control group).

The main goal was to see if treatment A improved survival time. The study included 515 patients (265 in treatment A group, 250 in control group). The results showed that people in the treatment A group lived a median of 5.4 months, while those in the control group lived 4.4 months. However, this difference wasn't statistically significant (P =.16), meaning it could be due to chance rather than treatment A's effect.

But when looking at patients with lung cancer (NSCLC) or breast cancer separately, treatment A seemed to help more. For breast cancer patients, the median survival time was 6.0 months with treatment A versus 4.4 months without. The study also found that treatment A improved response rates (how well tumors shrink) by 13% for breast cancer patients.

The results showed that the median survival time (how long people lived halfway point for both groups) was 5.4 months for the treatment A group and 4.4 months for the control group. However, this difference was not statistically significant, meaning it could be due to chance rather than treatment A making a real difference.

The study also looked at other outcomes, like how well the tumors responded to treatment, whether the cancer progressed in the brain, and patients' quality of life. None of these showed a significant difference between the two groups. The most serious side effect for treatment A was low oxygen levels (hypoxemia) in some patients.

In simple words, the study found that adding treatment A to WBRT did not improve survival or other important outcomes for patients with brain metastases compared to WBRT alone. So"

To compare treatment A and comparator B in node‐positive, operable breast cancer patients.

This was a randomized, multicenter, phase III trial enrolling 638 eligible women with prior breast surgery and positive axillary dissection. Patients in Arm A received treatment A, with concomitant radiotherapy (50 Gy +/‐ 10‐20‐Gy boost). Patients in Arm B received comparator B, with subsequent radiotherapy.
Results:
Median treatment durations were 64 and 126 days (Arms A and B, respectively), with no significant difference in overall or disease‐free survival. Five‐year locoregional relapse‐free survival favored patients with conservative surgery (two thirds of the population), with less local and / or regional recurrence in Arm A than in Arm B (3% vs. 9%; p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis in this subgroup showed a 2.8‐fold increased risk of locoregional recurrence with comparator B, independent of other prognostic factors (p = 0.027). Febrile neutropenia and Grade 3‐4 leukopenia were significantly more frequent in Arm A. Subclinical left ventricular ejection fraction events at 1 year were more frequent with treatment A (p = 0.02).
Conclusion:

The main findings:
- Treatment A took about 64 days, while Treatment B took 126 days, but both had similar overall survival and disease-free survival rates (meaning patients lived about the same length of time without cancer returning).
- However, Treatment A was better at preventing local and regional recurrences (cancer coming back near the original site) in women who had ""conservative surgery"" (surgery that saves as much breast tissue as possible). Only 3% of women in Treatment A group had local or regional recurrence, compared to 9% in Treatment B group.
- Unfortunately, Treatment A caused more side effects like febrile neutropenia (a dangerous drop in white blood cells with fever) and severe low white blood cell count (leukopenia). It also affected heart function (left ventricular ejection fraction) more at 1 year after treatment.

The main result: Both treatments were similar in keeping the cancer from coming back - 83% for Treatment A and 79% for Treatment B (not a big difference). There were also similar numbers of deaths and cancer spreading to other parts in both groups. However, Treatment A had more side effects like fever with low white blood cells (febrile neutropenia) and low overall white blood cell count (leukopenia), as well as more heart function issues (left ventricular ejection fraction events) after 1 year.

The contribution of treatment A in breast cancer patients after receiving adjuvant chemotherapy is not fully established. We investigated the impact of treatment A, given sequentially after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with operable breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
Between March 1991 and June 1999, 1863 women with stages I‐IIIA operable breast cancer who had undergone surgery and completed six cycles of adjuvant combination chemotherapy with either CMF, CAF, CEF, FAC or FEC were randomized to receive either treatment A for 3 years or no further treatment. Irrespective of menstrual status and hormone receptor content of the primary tumor, patients were stratified by institute, chemotherapy scheme and age (above 50 years or younger). The main end‐point was to detect a 5% increase in the 5 year survival (from 80% to 85%) in favor of treatment A.

To assess whether the use of intervention A as an adjunct to colposcopy increases the detection of biopsy confirmed CIN 2, 3 (high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia).
Methods:
This is a multicenter two‐arm randomized trial comparing colposcopy alone with colposcopy plus intervention A. Patients were recruited from 13 colposcopy clinics in a variety of practice settings. 2299 women referred for the evaluation of an abnormal cervical cytology were randomized with stratification by cytology; subsequently 113 women were excluded for a variety of reasons. The main study outcomes were differences in true‐positive rates (CIN 2, 3 and cancer identified) and false‐positive rates between the study arms.
Results:
The true‐positive (TP) rates were 14.4% vs. 11.4% (p=0.035, one‐sided) for the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm compared to colposcopy‐only arm, respectively, in women with either an atypical squamous cell (ASC) or low‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) cytology result. TP rates were similar between the two arms among women referred for the evaluation of HSIL (high‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). The 26.5% gain in true‐positives observed with the use of intervention A and colposcopy among women referred for an ASC or LSIL cytology was achieved with only a fractional increase in number of biopsies obtained per patient (0.30) and a modest increase in false‐positive rate
(4%). In the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm among women with ASC or LSIL, the PPV (positive predictive value) of biopsies indicated by ntervention A was 15.0% and the PPV of biopsies indicated by colposcopy was 15.2%. Joint hypothesis testing indicates that intervention A and colposcopy provides benefit compared to colposcopy alone among women with ASC or LSIL.

Combining intervention A with colposcopy provides a clinically meaningful increase in the detection of CIN 2, 3 in women referred for the evaluation of mildly abnormal cytology results.",spin,"Here's a simplified explanation for a fifth grader:

This study is about testing whether adding a specific method (called ""intervention A"") to a standard procedure (colposcopy) helps doctors find more high-grade cervical cell abnormalities (CIN 2, 3) in women who have mildly abnormal Pap smear results (ASC or LSIL).

Imagine colposcopy as a special magnifying tool for doctors to examine the cervix, and intervention A as an extra helper that might make this tool more effective. The study compared two groups: one using just colposcopy and another using colposcopy plus intervention A.

The results showed that when doctors used both colposcopy and intervention A together, they found more true cases of high-grade abnormalities (CIN 2, 3) in women with ASC or LSIL results, compared to using colposcopy alone. This improvement came with only a small increase in the number of biopsies taken and a modest increase in false-positives (when a test says there's a problem, but there isn't).

The conclusion is that combining intervention A with colposcopy helps doctors detect more high-grade cervical cell abnormalities in women with mildly abnormal Pap smear results, making it a useful addition to the standard procedure.

Primary end point was overall response rate (ORR; partial or complete response). In total, 221 patients were assessable.
Results:
ORR was 42.6% for CAF compared with 53.1% for treatment A + CAF, a 24.6% relative improvement and 10.5% absolute increase (P = .077). There was a trend for prolonged progression‐free survival (PFS; median 241 days for CAF v 366 days for treatment A + CAF; P = .145). In retrospectively defined subgroups, significant improvement in PFS in favor of treatment A was observed in patients who were premenopausal, had no prior therapy, and were stage IV at diagnosis with an intact primary tumor. Except for neutropenia and leukopenia, there was no statistically significant excess of grade 3/4 adverse events compared with CAF. Treatment with treatment A did not affect the plasma concentration of doxorubicin.
Conclusion:
Treatment A + CAF was well tolerated and is suggested to have efficacy in patients who had not received prior therapy.",spin,"Here's a simplified explanation for a fifth grader:

This study is about comparing two treatments for advanced or recurrent (hard-to-treat, came back after initial treatment) breast cancer in women. One treatment is called CAF (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, fluorouracil), which is a standard combination of chemotherapy drugs. The other treatment adds ""Treatment A"" (not specified by name here, but likely another drug or agent) to the CAF regimen.

The researchers gave these treatments to 221 patients, divided randomly into two groups, and didn't tell them or the doctors which treatment each patient received (double-blind). They looked at how well the cancer responded (overall response rate, ORR) and how long patients stayed cancer-free after treatment (progression-free survival, PFS).

The results showed that adding Treatment A to CAF led to a higher response rate (53.1% vs 42.6%) and a trend toward longer progression-free survival (366 days vs 241 days), especially for younger women (premenopausal) who hadn't had prior treatment and had stage IV cancer with an intact primary tumor. However, these improvements didn't quite reach statistical significance (P-values > 0.05), which means they could be due to chance. There were no major differences in severe side effects between the two treatments.

The conclusion is that adding Treatment A to CAF might be beneficial, especially for certain subgroups of patients"

This study compared two treatments for advanced or recurrent (hard-to-treat, returning) breast cancer in women. One treatment was ""CAF"" (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, fluorouracil) combined with a new agent called ""Treatment A,"" while the other was CAF combined with a placebo (a dummy pill with no active medicine). The researchers wanted to see if adding Treatment A made CAF work better or caused more side effects.

The study involved 227 patients, but 221 were actually analyzed. The main goal was to measure how many patients' cancer responded (got smaller or went away) - this is called the overall response rate (ORR). The ORR for CAF + placebo was 42.6%, while for Treatment A + CAF, it was 53.1%, but this difference wasn't statistically significant (meaning it could be due to chance, not a real effect). The time until cancer progressed (got worse) was 241 days for CAF + placebo and 366 days for Treatment A + CAF, but again, this difference wasn't statistically significant.

However, more patients experienced side effects, especially a low white blood cell count (neutropenia), when taking Treatment A with CAF. Treatment A didn't change the levels of doxorubicin in the blood.

In 1996, we initiated the multicenter phase III randomized trial to compare the effect on disease‐free survival (DFS) of experimental treatment A versus comparator B after breast‐conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer. This report presents the clinical results with a median follow‐up of 60 months.
Patients and methods:
Between February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery.
Results:
There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5‐year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis‐free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76). Nevertheless, in the node‐positive subgroup, the 5‐year LRFS was statistically better in the treatment A arm (97% in treatment A v 91% in comparator B; P = .02), corresponding to a risk of locoregional recurrence decreased by 39% (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.93).

This study, started in 1996, compared two treatments (let's call them Treatment A and Treatment B) for women with early-stage breast cancer (stages I and II) after they had breast-conserving surgery.

From 1996 to 2000, 716 women joined this study, and treatments began within 6 weeks after surgery. After following these women for 5 years (median 60 months), the researchers found no significant difference between Treatment A and Treatment B in overall disease-free survival, local recurrence-free survival, metastasis-free survival, or overall survival. However, for women with cancer in their lymph nodes (node-positive), Treatment A showed better local recurrence-free survival (97% vs 91% for Treatment B).

The conclusion is that Treatment A might be a good option for women with breast cancer at high risk of recurrence, especially those with node-positive cancer. The study suggests that combining new drugs for breast cancer could be beneficial.

Women with MBC were randomly assigned to first‐line therapy with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks plus treatment A or placebo. A preplanned retrospective evaluation of HER‐2 status was performed using fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP); secondary end points were objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), event‐free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS).
Results:
In the intent‐to‐treat population (n = 579), there were no significant differences in TTP, EFS, or OS between treatment arms, although differences in ORR and CBR were noted. In 86 HER‐2‐positive patients (15%), treatment with paclitaxel‐ treatment A resulted in statistically significant improvements in TTP, EFS, ORR, and CBR compared with paclitaxel‐placebo.

This phase III study compared the efficacy and safety of treatment A with comparator B in advanced breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
Patients were randomly assigned to treatment A or comparator B. Comparison of progression‐free survival (PFS) was the primary objective.
Results:
Patient characteristics were balanced between arms (N = 305). Median PFS was 8.05 months (95% CI, 6.60 to 8.71) for treatment A and 7.98 (95% CI, 6.93 to 8.77) for comparator B (log‐rank P = .121). Overall response rate (ORR) was 32% in both arms, and overall survival (OS) was not different between arms (P = .983). Time to treatment failure (TTF; defined as discontinuation, progressive disease, death as a result of any cause, or the start of a new anticancer therapy) was superior in the treatment A arm (P = .059).

3. The overall response rate (ORR), which measures how many patients' tumors shrank, was 32% for both treatments. There was also no difference in overall survival (OS) between the two groups.
4. However, treatment A had a slightly longer ""time to treatment failure"" (TTF), meaning patients stayed on it longer before needing to stop or switch treatments due to side effects or disease progression.
5. The study also looked at side effects. Treatment A had more severe low white blood cell counts (leukopenia) and required more blood transfusions, but comparator B had more severe diarrhea, mouth sores (mucositis), and hand-and-foot syndrome. Fewer patients stopped treatment A due to side effects compared to comparator B.
6. The conclusion is that, while treatment A didn't"

This phase III study compared the efficacy and safety of treatment A with comparator B in advanced breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
Patients were randomly assigned to treatment A or comparator B. Comparison of progression‐free survival (PFS) was the primary objective.
Results:
Patient characteristics were balanced between arms (N = 305). Median PFS was 8.05 months (95% CI, 6.60 to 8.71) for treatment A and 7.98 (95% CI, 6.93 to 8.77) for comparator B (log‐rank P = .121). Overall response rate (ORR) was 32% in both arms, p=0.931. The median time to treatment failure (TTF; defined as discontinuation, progressive disease, death as a result of any cause, or the start of a new anticancer therapy) was 4.24 months (95% CI, 4.11 to 4.44) for treatment A and 4.07 months (95% CI, 3.81 to 4.24) for comparator B, p=0.059. The medial overall survival was 19.29 months (95% CI, 15.57 to 23.59) for treatment A vs. 21.45 months (95% CI, 17.12 to 24.94), p=0.983. Hematologic toxicity was similar in both arms, except for grades 3 to 4 leukopenia (treatment A, 78%; comparator B, 66%; P = .025) and transfusions (treatment A, 17%; comparator B, 7%; P = .0051) and grades 3 to 4 diarrhea (treatment A, 8%; comparator B, 18%; p=0.009), mucositis (treatment A, 4%; comparator B, 15%; p<.001), and hand‐and‐foot syndrome (treatment A, 0%; comparator B, 26%, p<.001). 13% in treatment A arm and 27% in the comparator B arm discontinued because of drug‐related adverse events (P = .002).

Many cancer patients continue to smoke postdiagnosis, yet there have been few smoking cessation trials for this population.
Methods:
This double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial randomized 246 cancer patients to 9 weeks of placebo or treatment A, stratifying by pre‐treatment depression symptoms. In addition, all patients received transdermal nicotine and behavioral counseling. Primary outcomes were 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence, biochemically confirmed, at the end of treatment (Week 12), and at 6 months post quit day (Week 27). Additional outcomes included: withdrawal, affect, quality of life, compliance, and side effects.
Results:
There was no main effect of treatment A vs. placebo on abstinence (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.38‐4.81, p =0.64). At week 12, the abstinence rates were 24.2% for placebo and 27.2% for treatment A; at week 27, the abstinence rates were 17.4% for placebo and 18.4% for treatment A. There was no statistically significant difference between placebo and treatment A in average daily smoking to week 12 (mean [SE] 5.2 [0.95] vs. 5.3 [1.0]; p=0.97); and to week 27 (mean [SE] 5.4 [0.88] vs. 6.1 [0.90]; p=0.64). There were no statistically significant difference between placebo and treatment A on changes in withdrawals (p=0.39); negative (p=0.41) and positive affect (p=0.77), and physical (p=0.31) and mental (p=0.42) quality of life.
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than placebo on the prevalence of abstinence of cancer patients who continue to smoke postdiagnosis.",no_spin,"Here's a summary for a fifth grader:

This study looked at whether a specific treatment (called ""Treatment A"" - not naming the exact medication for simplicity at this level) helps cancer patients quit smoking after they've been diagnosed. The researchers compared this treatment to a placebo (a dummy pill with no active ingredients) in 246 cancer patients. All patients also received nicotine patches (transdermal nicotine) and counseling to help them quit.

The main goal was to see if more patients stopped smoking completely by Week 12 (end of treatment) and Week 27 (6 months after quitting day) in the Treatment A group compared to the placebo group. They also checked for differences in withdrawal symptoms, mood, quality of life, and side effects.

The results showed that Treatment A did not work better than the placebo in helping cancer patients quit smoking. At Week 12, about 24% of patients in the placebo group and 27% in the Treatment A group had stopped smoking, but this difference wasn't significant. By Week 27, about 17% in the placebo group and 18% in the Treatment A group had stopped smoking, again with no significant difference. There were also no significant differences in withdrawal symptoms, mood, quality of life, or side effects between the two groups.

So, the conclusion is that Treatment A did not prove more effective than a placebo in helping cancer patients quit smoking after diagnosis. This study's findings are presented straightforwardly without any spin or misleading"
41,20087643,A bupropion smoking cessation clinical trial for cancer patients,Cancer Causes Control,"Objective:
Many cancer patients continue to smoke postdiagnosis, yet there have been few smoking cessation trials for this population. Depression, which is prevalent among cancer patients, may be a barrier to cessation.
Methods:
This double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial randomized 246 cancer patients to 9 weeks of placebo or treatment A, stratifying by pre‐treatment depression symptoms. In addition, all patients received transdermal nicotine and behavioral counseling. Primary outcomes were 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence, biochemically confirmed, at the end of treatment (Week 12), and at 6 months post quit day (Week 27). Additional outcomes included: withdrawal, affect, quality of life, compliance, and side effects.
Results:
There was no main effect of treatment A vs. placebo on abstinence (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.38‐4.81, p = 0.64). Patients with depression symptoms reported significantly lower abstinence rates vs. patients without depression symptoms (OR = .14, 95% CI: 0.02‐0.80, p=0.03). Treatment A increased abstinence rates, vs. placebo, more for participants with depression vs. those without depression symptoms. For patients with depression symptoms, treatment A reduced withdrawal symptoms and improved quality of life vs. placebo.
Conclusion:
For patients with depression symptoms, treatment increases abstinence rates, lowers withdrawal, and increases quality of life. However, abstinence rates among patients with depression symptoms were low vs. patients without depression symptoms, who exhibited similar abstinence rates when treated with treatment A or transdermal nicotine and counseling alone. These results can guide future smoking cessation intervention studies with cancer patients.",spin,"Here's a simplified explanation for a fifth grader:

This study looked at helping cancer patients quit smoking. Even after being diagnosed with cancer, many people keep smoking, and there haven't been many tests of quit-smoking programs for them. The researchers thought depression, which is common among cancer patients, might make quitting harder.

In this study, 246 cancer patients were randomly divided into two groups: one got a special treatment (treatment A) and the other got a placebo (like a sugar pill). Both groups also used nicotine patches and received counseling to help them quit. The researchers checked if people had quit smoking after 12 weeks and again 6 months later. They also looked at withdrawal symptoms, mood, quality of life, and side effects.

The main result was that treatment A didn't work better than the placebo for quitting smoking overall. However, patients with depression symptoms had a harder time quitting than those without depression. But, for patients with depression, treatment A did help them quit more than the placebo, and it also made withdrawal symptoms less severe and improved their quality of life.

So, for cancer patients with depression, this special treatment (treatment A) can help them quit smoking better, reduce withdrawal symptoms, and improve their quality of life. But, patients with depression still had lower quit rates compared to those without depression, no matter the treatment.

This study compared two treatments, called A and B, for people with advanced kidney cancer (metastatic renal cell carcinoma) that has spread to other parts. It was conducted in 50 hospitals across eight countries, involving 1006 patients who hadn't received these treatments before. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: 502 got treatment B, and 504 got treatment A (which is a combined therapy). The main goal was to see which treatment led to longer overall survival (how long people lived).

After following the patients for an average of 37.2 months, the researchers found that both groups had similar survival times: 18.8 months for treatment B and 18.6 months for treatment A. This means there was no significant difference in overall survival between the two treatments. They also noted that serious side effects occurred in about 23% of patients on treatment B and 26% on treatment A.

The important takeaway is that treatment A didn't improve overall survival compared to treatment B. However, treatment A might still be helpful for some patients because it can lead to longer periods of remission (when the cancer shrinks or stops growing) in certain cases. The challenge now is to identify which patients would benefit from treatment A.

Cancer‐related fatigue is a debilitating symptom affecting psychosocial functioning and quality of life in 70% to 100% of cancer patients during and after treatment. The authors examined the effect of 200 mg of treatment A compared to placebo on the severity of cancer‐related fatigue.
Methods:
The authors conducted a multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐ controlled, phase 3, clinical trial to examine the effect of treatment A on patient‐ reported fatigue in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. A sample of 877 cancer patients beginning chemotherapy at 23 geographically separate University of Rochester Cancer Center (URCC) Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) affiliates were assessed for fatigue. Patients who reported fatigue (N = 867) were randomly assigned to receive either treatment A or a placebo. Treatment began on Day 5 of Cycle 2 and ended after Day 7 of Cycle 4. Fatigue, sleepiness and depression were assessed during Cycles 2 to 4 by using psychometrically valid measures. The primary outcome was the worst level of cancer related fatigue during the previous week at Cycle 4. Group differences (treatment vs. placebo) were examined by using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusting for baseline fatigue (Cycle 2).

The treatment or placebo was given starting from Day 5 of their second chemotherapy cycle and ended after Day 7 of their fourth cycle.

The researchers measured fatigue, sleepiness, and depression using standardized tests during these chemotherapy cycles. They focused on the worst fatigue level reported by patients during the week before Cycle 4 ended. 

The results showed that there was no significant difference in the worst fatigue levels between the Treatment A group and the placebo group. However, the Treatment A group reported less sleepiness compared to the placebo group, but Treatment A did not affect depression levels.

23,20564068,"A phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, clinical trial of the effect of modafinil on cancer-related fatigue among 631 patients receiving chemotherapy: a University of Rochester Cancer Center Community Clinical Oncology Program Research base study",Cancer,"Background:
Cancer‐related fatigue is a debilitating symptom affecting psychosocial functioning and quality of life in 70% to 100% of cancer patients during and after treatment. The authors examined the effect of treatment A on the severity of cancer‐related fatigue.
Methods:
The authors conducted a multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐ controlled, phase 3, clinical trial to examine the effect of treatment A on patient‐ reported fatigue in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. A sample of 877 cancer patients beginning chemotherapy at 23 geographically separate University of Rochester Cancer Center (URCC) Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) affiliates were assessed for fatigue. Patients who reported fatigue (N = 867) were randomly assigned to receive either treatment A or a placebo. Treatment began on Day 5 of Cycle 2 and ended after Day 7 of Cycle 4. Fatigue and depression were assessed during Cycles 2 to 4 by using psychometrically valid measures. Group differences (treatment vs. control) in the worst level of fatigue during the previous week at Cycle 4 were examined by using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusting for baseline fatigue (Cycle 2).
Results:
There were 631 patients (315 treatment A, 316 placebo) who provided evaluable data. ANCOVA showed a significant interaction between treatment condition and baseline fatigue (P = .017), where patients with severe baseline fatigue (n = 458) benefited from treatment A, whereas patients with mild or moderate fatigue did not. Treatment A had no statistically significant effect on depression (P > .05).
Conclusions:
Treatment A may be useful in controlling cancer‐related fatigue in patients who present with severe fatigue but is not useful in patients with mild or moderate fatigue.",spin,"Here's a simplified explanation for a fifth grader:

This study is about a problem called cancer-related fatigue, which is extreme tiredness that affects almost all (70% to 100%) cancer patients during and after their treatments. The researchers tested a treatment called ""Treatment A"" to see if it helps reduce this fatigue in patients undergoing chemotherapy.

They did a big, careful experiment (a clinical trial) with 877 cancer patients from 23 different medical centers. Out of these, 867 patients reported feeling fatigued. The researchers randomly divided these tired patients into two groups: one group got Treatment A, and the other group got a dummy pill (placebo) that doesn't have any real medicine in it. They started giving Treatment A or the placebo on the 5th day of the second chemotherapy cycle and stopped on the 7th day of the fourth cycle. They measured fatigue and depression levels during this time using special questionnaires.

The results showed that Treatment A helped only those patients who were extremely tired (severe fatigue) at the beginning of the study. It didn't help patients who were just moderately or mildly tired. Treatment A didn't affect depression levels either.

So, the main point is that Treatment A might be useful for controlling extreme fatigue in cancer patients, but it doesn't help those with less severe tiredness. The ""spin"" warning means that sometimes researchers or writers might exaggerate or misrepresent the results to make them sound more positive than they really are"

The characteristics of the 260 patients randomized to cytarabine and idarubicine with treatment A or cytarabine and idarubicine alone (control arm) were similar in both arms. 62.5% of patients randomized in the treatment A arm had a complete response to induction vs. 64.6% in the control arm; p=0.72. The three‐year OS rates were not statistically significantly different between treatment A and control arm (25.6 +/‐ 5.1% vs. 31.8 +/‐ 5.6%; p=0.38. Treatment A as an adjunct to cytarabine and idarubicine was not more effective than cytarabine and idarubicine alone in acute myeloid leukemia patients.,no_spin,"Here's a simple explanation for your fifth grader:

This passage describes a big medical study (a phase III clinical trial) about treating a type of blood cancer called acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The study compared two groups of patients: one group received standard chemotherapy drugs (cytarabine and idarubicine) plus an additional treatment called ""Treatment A,"" while the other group received only the standard chemotherapy drugs (control arm). The researchers looked at two main outcomes: how well the cancer responded to the initial treatment (called ""response to induction"") and how many patients were still alive after 3 years (overall survival, or OS).

The study found that:
- About 62.5% of patients in the Treatment A group had their cancer go into complete remission after initial treatment, compared to 64.6% in the control group. This difference is not significant (p=0.72), meaning it could be due to chance.
- The 3-year survival rates were 25.6% for the Treatment A group and 31.8% for the control group. Again, this difference is not statistically significant (p=0.38), so it's likely due to chance rather than any real effect of Treatment A.

In simple terms, this study showed that adding Treatment A to standard chemotherapy did not improve the response to initial treatment or increase 3-year survival rates for AML patients compared to using standard chemotherapy alone. The study's results are presented"

Significant factors for better survival were the use of treatment A (p = 0.049), female sex (p = 0.05) and single induction cycle (p < 0.001) in multivariate analysis. Female patients performed better than male patients. Better survival obtained among female AML patients needs to be validated within the context of cytogenetic analysis.",spin,"Here's a simplified explanation for a fifth grader:

This passage is about a big medical study (like a science experiment for people) called a phase III clinical trial. It's testing a treatment, ""Treatment A,"" as an extra help (an ""adjunct"") for standard therapy in newly diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients, specifically during the initial treatment phase called remission induction. You can find details of this study on a website called clinicaltrials.gov (with a specific code NCTXXXXX, though the actual code is not provided here).

The study compared two groups of patients with similar characteristics. Treatment A made leukopenia (a side effect where white blood cells are very low) less severe and shorter-lasting. However, when looking at overall survival (OS) after three years, both groups had similar results (about 25-32% survival) except for patients with certain cell features called myeloblastic.

The study found that using Treatment A, being female, and needing only one round of induction therapy were factors linked to better survival. Female patients did better than male patients, but this needs to be checked further by looking at the chromosomes (cytogenetic analysis) in their cancer cells.

Methods and material:
Patients with ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast carcinoma who were undergoing external beam radiotherapy to the breast or chest wall were randomly assigned to apply treatment A or placebo cream daily. The primary study endpoint was the provider assessed maximal grade of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, radiation dermatitis.
Results:
A total of 176 patients were enrolled between September 21, 2007, and December 7, 2007. The provider assessed primary endpoint showed no difference in the mean maximum grade of radiation dermatitis by treatment arm (1.2+/‐0.85 for treatment A vs. 1.3+/‐0.80 for placebo; p = .18). Severe radiation dermatitis concerned 4 (5%) in both arms; p=.97.

This study looked at whether a treatment called ""Treatment A"" (a specific cream) could reduce skin problems caused by radiation therapy in patients with breast cancer. Radiation therapy is a common treatment for cancer, but it can irritate the skin, causing issues like redness, discomfort, or itching, known as radiation dermatitis.

In this study, 176 patients getting radiation for breast or chest wall cancer were randomly divided into two groups. One group applied Treatment A cream daily, while the other group used a placebo cream (a dummy cream with no active ingredients). Doctors checked the patients' skin for the worst level of radiation dermatitis they experienced, using a standardized grading system (Common Terminology Criteria).

The results showed that Treatment A did not perform better than the placebo in reducing severe skin problems. Both groups had about the same percentage of patients with severe radiation dermatitis (5% in each). When looking at all levels of skin toxicity (grades 0 to 4), there were some differences between the groups, but these differences were not strong enough to conclude that Treatment A was significantly better.

Patients also reported their own experiences using a questionnaire called Skindex-16, which measures skin-related quality of life.

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment A in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer (OC).
Methods:
Patients with platinum‐refractory or ‐resistant primary or secondary) OC were randomized to receive treatment A and PLD at 50 mg/m2 intravenously or PLD alone at 50 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 every 28 days until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression‐free survival (PFS). Other end points were objective response rate and safety. The study was originally planned for 244 patients. The trial was temporarily placed on hold after 125 patients were randomized while the results of another trial were being reviewed and the sponsor decided not to resume enrollment. The interim analysis became the final analysis.
Results:
The median PFS was 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD (n = 65) versus 3.7 months for PLD (n = 60) (hazards ratio, 0.92; P = 0.7243). A preplanned subgroup analysis showed that 75 patients with platinum‐refractory or primary platinum‐resistant OC had a median PFS of 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD versus 2.9 months for PLD (hazards ratio, 0.55; P = 0.0425). Hematologic adverse events were 66% on the treatment A + PLD arm versus 44% on the PLD arm, manageable with dose reductions. Nonhematologic adverse events were similar for both arms. The incidence of palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis was lower on treatment A + PLD (23%, 31%, respectively) versus (39%, 49%, respectively) on PLD.
Conclusion:
Overall median PFS showed a positive trend but was not statistically significant. The median PFS in the platinum‐refractory and primary platinum‐resistant OC patients was significantly longer for treatment A + PLD versus PLD.

We examined the value of treatment A in a phase III trial with strict preoperative staging and surgical resection guidelines.
Patients and methods:
Patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagogastric junction (AEG II and III) were randomly assigned to treatment A followed by surgery or to surgery alone. To detect with 80% power an improvement in median survival from 17 months with surgery alone to 24 months with treatment A, 282 events were required.
Results:
This trial was stopped for poor accrual after 144 patients were randomly assigned (72:72); 52.8% patients had tumors located in the proximal third of the stomach, including AEG type II and III. The International Union against Cancer R0 resection rate was 81.9% after treatment A as compared with 66.7% with surgery alone (P = .036). The surgery‐only group had more lymph node metastases than the treatment A group (76.5% v 61.4%; P = .018).

Conclusion:
This trial showed a significantly increased R0 resection rate but failed to demonstrate a survival benefit. Possible explanations are low statistical power, a high rate of proximal gastric cancer including AEG and/or a better outcome than expected after radical surgery alone due to the high quality of surgery with resections of regional lymph nodes outside the perigastic area (celiac trunc, hepatic ligament, lymph node at a. lienalis; D2).",spin,"Here's a simplified explanation for a fifth grader:

The goal was to see if adding treatment A would increase patients' survival time from 17 months (with surgery alone) to 24 months. However, the study stopped early because not enough patients joined (only 144 out of the planned number), which weakened its ability to show significant differences.

Despite this limitation, the study found that treatment A led to more successful tumor removals (R0 resections) - 81.9% vs 66.7% for surgery alone. Treatment A also resulted in fewer lymph node metastases (cancer spread to lymph nodes) compared to surgery alone (61.4% vs 76.5%). However, treatment A had more postoperative complications (27.1% vs 16.2%).

After following patients for 4.4 years and recording 67 deaths, the study couldn't show that treatment A improved overall survival (hazard ratio 0.84, not statistically significant). Possible reasons for this include the low number of patients, the high proportion of proximal stomach cancers (AEG), or unexpectedly good outcomes from surgery"

We examined the value of treatment A in a phase III trial with strict preoperative staging and surgical resection guidelines.
Patients and methods:
Patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagogastric junction (AEGII and III) were randomly assigned to treatment A followed by surgery or to surgery alone. The primary outcome was overall survival.
Results:
This trial was stopped for poor accrual after 144 patients were randomly assigned (72:72); 52.8% patients had tumors located in the proximal third of the stomach, including AEG type II and III. After a median follow‐up of 4.4 years and 67 deaths, the median survival was 64.6 months (95% CI, 42.4 to NA) in the treatment A arm versus 52.5 month (95% CI 31.7 to NA) in the surgery alone arm (hazard ratio 0.84; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.35; P = .466). The survival rate at 2 year was respectively 72.7% (95% CI, 60.7‐81.7) and 69.9% (95% CI, 57.7‐79.2) in the treatment A and surgery‐only arm. The HR for progression free survival was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.49‐ 1.16; p=.20). The International Union against Cancer R0 resection rate was 81.9% after treatment A as compared with 66.7% with surgery alone (P = .036). The surgery‐only group had more lymph node metastases than the treatment A (76.5% v 61.4%; p = .018). Postoperative complications were more frequent in the treatment A arm (27.1% v 16.2%; P = .09).
Conclusion:
Treatment A followed by surgery was not more effective than surgery alone on overall survival in patients with locally advanced cancer of the stomach.",no_spin,"Here's a simple explanation for a fifth grader:

This study looked at a specific treatment, called ""treatment A,"" for people with advanced stomach or esophagogastric junction (where the esophagus meets the stomach) cancer types AEG II and III. The researchers compared two groups: one that received treatment A before surgery, and another that had surgery without treatment A beforehand. They wanted to see if adding treatment A improved overall survival (how long people lived) for these patients.

The study stopped early because not enough patients joined (only 144 out of a desired larger number), but they still analyzed the results. After about 4.4 years of follow-up, they found that the median survival time (middle value when arranging survival times from shortest to longest) was 64.6 months for the treatment A group and 52.5 months for the surgery-only group. However, this difference was not statistically significant (P =.466), meaning it could be due to chance rather than treatment A's effect.

The study also looked at other factors, like progression-free survival (time without cancer growth), successful removal of cancer (R0 resection rate), lymph node metastases (cancer spread to lymph nodes), and postoperative complications. While treatment A showed some advantages in these secondary outcomes (like better R0 resection rate and fewer lymph node metastases), the main goal—improving overall survival—was not achieved.

This study looked at a treatment (let's call it ""Treatment A"") to help people with cancer sleep better while they're undergoing cancer treatment. Sleep problems are common in cancer survivors, ranging from 23% to 61% of them, but current prescription sleep medicines aren't ideal for long-term use or specifically tested for this group, and they can have unwanted side effects and be expensive.

They did this for 8 weeks. The main goal was to see if Treatment A improved sleep quality, measured by a questionnaire called the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). They also looked at fatigue, mood, and any side effects.

The results showed that Treatment A didn't significantly improve sleep quality compared to the placebo, based on the PSQI scores. However, when they looked at other aspects, like fatigue, people taking Treatment A reported feeling less tired and had fewer drowsiness issues compared to those on the placebo. There were no major differences in side effects between the two groups.

Patients and methods:
One hundred and ninety‐two breast, gastrointestinal, and haematologic cancer patients were recruited before the trial closing prematurely (original target 352). Treatment A was administered before first treatment (intervention 1), 48 h after first treatment (intervention 2), and immediately before second treatment (intervention 3).

This study looked at a special education program (called Treatment A) for cancer patients before they start chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is a strong treatment to fight cancer, but it can cause unpleasant side effects. The researchers wanted to see if this education program could reduce patients' worries, distress, and some specific side effects like vomiting.

In this study, 192 patients with breast, stomach, or blood-related cancers were divided into groups to receive Treatment A at different times (before, 48 hours after, or right before their second chemotherapy session). The researchers measured patients' distress and concerns before the education (T1), and then again before their first (T2) and third (T3) chemotherapy cycles.

The results showed that Treatment A didn't significantly lower overall distress. However, it did help patients feel less worried about sensory/psychological and procedural aspects of treatment (like how it might feel or what happens during treatment). It also reduced vomiting and its bothersome effects significantly by the third cycle (T3). For patients who were very distressed at the beginning, Treatment A seemed to help them feel better before their first cycle (T2), but not as much before their third cycle (T3).

The conclusion is that Treatment A might be useful for improving some aspects of patients' experiences, like reducing treatment-related concerns and vomiting. However, more research is needed with different types of patients to make sure these results apply to everyone.
