Randomized trial of fenretinide to prevent second breast malignancy in women with early breast cancer",J Natl Cancer Inst,"Background:
Treatment A has been shown to inhibit breast carcinogenesis in preclinical studies. We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.
Methods:
We randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30‐70 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66‐1.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64‐1.09; P = .177) between the two arms. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs (38 in the treatment A arm versus 40 in the control arm), incidence of distant metastasis (HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.79‐1.22; P = .858), and all‐cause mortality (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.92‐1.48; P = .215).
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than no treatment in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.",no_spin,"Here's a simplified explanation for a fifth grader:

This study looked at a medicine called Treatment A to see if it could prevent a second breast cancer from happening in women who already had their first breast cancer (stage I or ductal carcinoma in situ) removed by surgery. These women were between 30 and 70 years old.

The researchers divided 2972 women into two groups: one group (1496 women) took Treatment A as a pill (200 mg each day) for 5 years, and the other group (1476 women) didn't take any special medicine. They made sure the assignment was random and fair, like flipping a coin, and managed it from a center in Milan. Doctors examining mammograms didn't know which group each woman belonged to.

The main goal was to compare how many women in each group developed a new breast cancer (either in the opposite breast or the same breast) 7 years after they joined the study. They used special math called Cox regression to analyze the results.

Out of 2867 women whose data could be used, there were 1432 in the Treatment A group and 1435 in the control group. After about 8 years (97 months) of watching them, the researchers found no significant difference in new breast cancers between the two groups. They also checked for cancers in other organs, distant metastasis (cancer spreading), and overall deaths, but there were no significant differences either.

So, the conclusion is: Treatment"

The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization.

Results:
At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (P =.642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (P =.177) between the two arms. However, an interaction was detected between treatment A and menopausal status in both outcomes (P for interaction in both outcomes =.045), with a possible beneficial effect in premenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66, and 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.41‐1.07; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 0.65, and 95% CI = 0.46‐0. 92) and an opposite effect in postmenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.32, and 95% CI = 0.82‐2.15; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.19, and 95% CI = 0.75‐1. 89). There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs, incidence of distant metastasis, and all‐cause mortality.
Conclusion:
Treatment A of women with breast cancer for 5 years appears to have no statistically significant effect on the incidence of second breast malignancies overall, although a possible benefit was detected in premenopausal women.

The main finding: Overall, there was no significant difference in preventing second breast cancers between the group taking Treatment A and the group without it. However, when they looked closer at different age groups related to menopause (before menopause - premenopausal, or after menopause - postmenopausal), they found:

- For premenopausal women, Treatment A might have a beneficial effect (lower risk) in preventing both contralateral (opposite breast) and ipsilateral (same breast) cancers, though the results weren't strong enough to be certain.
- For postmenopausal women, Treatment A might have an opposite effect (higher risk) for both types of cancers, but again, the results weren't conclusive.

There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of tumors in other organs, distant metastases (cancer spreading), or overall death rates.

Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization. The two end points of interest for this study were time to treatment failure (TTF) and survival time.
Results:
Median survival was 30.0 months for chemotherapy alone and 29.3 months treatment A and chemotherapy, p=0.834. Time to treatment failure (TTF) was 13.4 months for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with 10.3 month for chemotherapy alone patients (P = .087). The response rates (complete response and partial response) was 69.2% of for patients who received chemotherapy alone and 68.9% for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy, P =.99.

This study looked at two ways to treat metastatic breast cancer (cancer that has spread from the breast to other parts of the body). One group of patients received only chemotherapy, while another group received ""treatment A"" combined with chemotherapy. The researchers wanted to know if adding treatment A made things better for the patients.

From 1988 to 1992, 231 patients were randomly assigned to one of these two treatments. The study checked two main things: how long it took for the treatment to stop working (time to treatment failure, or TTF) and how long the patients lived (survival time).

The results showed that:
- Patients lived about 30 months with chemotherapy alone and 29.3 months with treatment A plus chemotherapy (not significantly different).
- Treatment failure happened after 10.3 months for chemotherapy alone and 13.4 months for treatment A plus chemotherapy (not significantly different either).
- Both groups had similar response rates (how well the cancer shrunk or disappeared) - about 69% for chemotherapy alone and 68.9% for treatment A plus chemotherapy.
- Both treatments had similar side effects, and there were four deaths from severe side effects, with three of those in patients receiving treatment A with chemotherapy.

The conclusion is that, for patients with metastatic breast cancer, adding treatment A to chemotherapy did not make the treatment more effective than using chemotherapy alone."

Patients and methods:
Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with estrogen receptor (ER)‐positive or ER‐unknown metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization.
Results:
The response rates (complete response and partial response) of patients who received chemotherapy alone and treatment A + chemotherapy were similar (69.2% v 68.9%, respectively; P =.99). Time to treatment failure (TTF) was slightly longer for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone patients (13.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.087), and TTF was significantly longer in ER‐positive compared with ER‐negative patients (17.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.048). However, ER status had no effect on overall survival (30.0 months for chemotherapy alone v 29.3 months for treatment A + chemotherapy).
Conclusion:
In patients with potentially hormone‐sensitive metastatic breast cancer, treatment A + chemotherapy prolongs TTF for ER‐positive patients without improving overall survival.",spin,"Here's a simplified explanation for a fifth grader:

This study looked at two ways to treat metastatic breast cancer (cancer that has spread) in patients whose cancer cells respond to estrogen (ER-positive) or where that response wasn't clear (ER-unknown). They compared using just chemotherapy (strong medicines to kill cancer cells) versus adding ""treatment A"" (not specified by name here, but likely a hormone therapy) to chemotherapy.

From 1988 to 1992, 231 patients were randomly assigned to either chemotherapy alone or treatment A plus chemotherapy. After initial treatment, some patients got extra maintenance treatment, and some didn't, based on another random choice.

The results showed that both groups (chemo alone and treatment A + chemo) had similar rates of complete or partial responses to the treatment (about 69% for both). However, patients who got treatment A + chemo took slightly longer to see their cancer worsen again (13.4 months vs 10.3 months). For patients with ER-positive cancer, this delay was more significant (17.4 months vs 10.3 months). But, importantly, adding treatment A didn't change how long patients lived overall (about 30 months for both groups).

So, in simple terms, for patients with metastatic breast cancer that might respond to hormone treatments, adding treatment A to chemotherapy helps delay the cancer's return in ER-positive patients, but it doesn't make them live longer overall."

Efficacy and safety of treatment A was compared with comparator B in a group of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, without previous systemic therapy for advanced breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
The study was a prospective double‐blind randomized trial. All treated patients presented with positive estrogen receptors. Main end points were response rates, toxicity profile analysis, time to progression and survival. WHO and ECOG criteria were employed for response evaluation while toxicity was assessed according to WHO guidelines. Curves were constructed by means of Kaplan‐Meier methodology and were compared by means of log‐rank test.
Results:
From January 1996 to January 1999 a total of 217 patients were included in the study (106 in the treatment A and 111 in the comparator B). Both groups of patients were homogeneous regarding the main prognostic factors. A response rate of 64% (68/106) was observed in the treatment A group as compared with a 52% (58/111) in the comparator B group. Median times to progression and overall survival were not significantly different. A lower incidence of undesirable effects was appreciated in the treatment A arm.

Both treatments were tested on women whose cancer cells respond to estrogen (hormonal positive receptors).

The study was designed like a fair coin toss (randomized) and neither the doctors nor the patients knew which treatment they were getting (double-blind). The researchers looked at how well each treatment worked (response rates), side effects (toxicity), time until the cancer progressed, and overall survival. They used special rules (WHO and ECOG criteria) to measure these things.

From 1996 to 1999, 217 women participated in the study—106 got treatment A, and 111 got treatment B. Both groups were similar in important factors that could affect the outcome. Treatment A helped 64% of its patients, while treatment B helped 52%. However, the time it took for the cancer to worsen and overall survival were about the same for both groups. Treatment A had fewer bad side effects.

The conclusion is that treatment A is a good and safe choice for treating advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women with hormonal positive receptors. It could be considered as a first-line therapy (the first treatment to try"

All cycles were given every 2 weeks with granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor support.
Results:
A total of 595 patients were eligible. Median follow‐up was 61.7 months for group A and 62 months for group B. DFS and OS did not differ significantly between treatment groups (log‐rank P = 0.55 and P = 0.38, respectively). The 3‐year DFS was 80% in group A and 77% in group B. Survival rates were 93% and 90%, respectively. Comparison of quality of life outcomes between the two groups showed no statistically significant differences. Both regimens were well tolerated and severe acute side‐effects were infrequent. No cases of severe cardiotoxicity or acute leukemia were recorded.
Conclusion:
Treatment A with a dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy was not more effective than a dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy alone in patients with high‐risk operable breast cancer.",no_spin,"This study looked at two chemotherapy treatment plans for people with high-risk, operable breast cancer (meaning the cancer can be surgically removed). Both plans involved strong medicines given in cycles, with each cycle spaced 2 weeks apart. The key difference was that one group (Group A) received an extra treatment, called ""treatment A,"" alongside standard chemotherapy drugs (epirubicin and CMF), while the other group (Group B) only received the standard chemotherapy drugs (epirubicin and CMF) without treatment A.

The researchers wanted to see if adding treatment A would improve two main outcomes: 1) disease-free survival (DFS), which means staying cancer-free after treatment, and 2) overall survival (OS), which means living longer regardless of cancer recurrence.

After following 595 patients for about 61-62 months, the study found that there was no significant difference in DFS or OS between the two groups. Both groups had similar rates of staying cancer-free (80% for Group A, 77% for Group B) and overall survival (93% for Group A, 90% for Group B). The quality of life and side effects were also similar for both groups, with no severe heart problems or acute leukemia reported.

In simple terms, this study showed that adding treatment A to the standard chemotherapy did not make a significant difference in helping patients with high-risk operable breast cancer live longer or stay cancer-free compared to using standard chemotherapy alone."

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy with or without treatment A primarily on disease‐free survival (DFS) and secondarily on overall survival (OS) in patients with high‐risk operable breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
From June 1997 until November 2000, 604 patients with T1‐3N1M0 or T3N0M0 tumors were randomized to three cycles of epirubicin 110 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of treatment A followed by three cycles of 'intensified' CMF (cyclophosphamide 840 mg/m2, methotrexate 47 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 840 mg/m2) (group A), or to four cycles of epirubicin followed by four cycles of CMF, as in group A (group B). All cycles were given every 2 weeks with granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor support.
Results:
A total of 595 patients were eligible. Median follow‐up was 61.7 months for group A and 62 months for group B. The 3‐year DFS was 80% in group A and 77% in group B. Survival rates were 93% and 90%, respectively. The effect of treatment on the hazard of death was different according to hormonal receptor status. More specifically, in patients with negative receptor status the hazard of death was significantly higher for group B (hazard ratio 2.42). Both regimens were well tolerated and severe acute side‐effects were infrequent. No cases of severe cardiotoxicity or acute leukemia were recorded.
Conclusion:
The present study failed to demonstrate a significant difference in DFS or OS between the two treatment groups. However, our study has shown clearly that treatment A can be safely incorporated to dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy.",spin,"This passage describes a research study about treating high-risk operable breast cancer in patients. Here's a simplified explanation:

Goal: The study aimed to compare two chemotherapy plans (treatments with strong medicines) to see which one is better for keeping patients cancer-free (disease-free survival, DFS) and overall living longer (overall survival, OS) after breast cancer surgery. One plan included ""treatment A"" alongside standard chemotherapy drugs, while the other plan used only the standard drugs without treatment A.

Who participated: From 1997 to 2000, 604 patients with specific types of breast tumors (T1-3N1M0 or T3N0M0) were randomly divided into two groups, A and B, for this comparison.

How treatments were given: Both groups received chemotherapy cycles every 2 weeks, with added support to protect their white blood cells. Group A had three cycles of epirubicin, then three cycles of treatment A, followed by three cycles of CMF (a mix of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil). Group B skipped treatment A and had four cycles of epirubicin followed by four cycles of CMF.

Results: Out of 604 patients, 595 were eligible for analysis. After about 61-62 months of follow-up, group A had an 80% disease-free survival rate (3-year DFS) and 93% overall survival rate, while group B"

To determine whether treatment A, improves survival in patients with brain metastases when used as an adjunct to whole‐brain radiation therapy (WBRT).
Patients and methods:
Patients with brain metastases from solid tumors and a Karnofsky performance score of > or = 70 were randomly assigned to receive WBRT with supplemental oxygen and either treatment A (treatment A arm) or no treatment (control arm). The primary end point was survival.
Results:
The study consisted of 515 eligible patients (treatment A arm, n = 265; control arm, n = 250). The median survival time (MST) was 5.4 months for the treatment A arm versus 4.4 months for the control arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87; P = .16). For the subgroup of patients with non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or breast cancer, the MST was 6.0 and 4.4 months, respectively (HR = 0.82; P = .07). Cox multiple regression analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of death for the treatment A arm in both primary populations. Further analysis indicated that the benefit may be restricted to the subgroup of patients with breast cancer. Response rates (radiographic complete response plus partial response) improved by 7% (P = .10) and 13% (P = .01) for all patients and for NSCLC and breast cancer patients in the treatment A arm, respectively. The most common severe adverse event in patients treated with treatment A was hypoxemia, which was reversible and effectively managed with supplemental oxygen in most patients.
Conclusion:
The addition of treatment A to WBRT may improve response rates and survival in patients with brain metastases, particularly metastases from breast cancer. A confirmatory trial for breast cancer patients has been initiated.",spin,"Here's a simplified explanation for a fifth grader:

This study looked at whether adding ""treatment A"" to standard whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) helps people live longer when they have cancer that has spread to their brain (brain metastases). The patients in this study had solid tumors (like lung or breast cancer) that moved to their brain, and they were still fairly active (Karnofsky score 70 or above, meaning they could care for themselves to some extent).

The researchers divided the patients randomly into two groups: one group got WBRT plus treatment A, and the other group got WBRT without treatment A (the control group). They measured how long people lived (median survival time) and how well the treatments worked (response rates).

The results showed that people in the treatment A group lived slightly longer (5.4 months) compared to the control group (4.4 months), but this difference wasn't strong enough to be considered statistically significant (P =.16). However, when they looked at patients with lung cancer (NSCLC) or breast cancer separately, treatment A seemed to help more, especially for breast cancer patients. Treatment A also improved response rates (how well tumors shrank) by 7% for all patients and 13% for lung and breast cancer patients.

The main side effect of treatment A was low oxygen levels (hypoxemia), but it could be managed with extra oxygen.

This study looked at people who have cancer that spread to their brains (called brain metastases) from other solid tumors in their body. The researchers wanted to see if adding a specific treatment, ""treatment A,"" to the usual whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) would help these patients live longer or do better overall.

To test this, they divided the patients into two groups: one group got WBRT plus treatment A, and the other group got WBRT alone (no treatment A). They measured how long people lived (median survival time) and checked for improvements in the cancer (response rates) and whether the cancer got worse in the brain (progression) over time. They also looked at patients' quality of life and any serious side effects.

The results showed that adding treatment A didn't make a significant difference compared to just using WBRT alone. People in both groups lived about the same amount of time (5.4 months for treatment A group vs. 4.4 months for control group), and there were no big differences in how well the cancer responded or progressed. About the same number of people in each group had stable or improving quality of life after 6 months. However, treatment A did cause more cases of a serious side effect called hypoxemia (low oxygen levels in the blood).

So, the conclusion is that adding treatment A to WBRT didn't help patients with brain metastases more than WB"

Results:
Median treatment durations were 64 and 126 days (Arms A and B, respectively), with no significant difference in overall or disease‐free survival. Five‐year locoregional relapse‐free survival favored patients with conservative surgery (two thirds of the population), with less local and / or regional recurrence in Arm A than in Arm B (3% vs. 9%; p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis in this subgroup showed a 2.8‐fold increased risk of locoregional recurrence with comparator B, independent of other prognostic factors (p = 0.027). Febrile neutropenia and Grade 3‐4 leukopenia were significantly more frequent in Arm A. Subclinical left ventricular ejection fraction events at 1 year were more frequent with treatment A (p = 0.02).

The contribution of treatment A in breast cancer patients after receiving adjuvant chemotherapy is not fully established. We investigated the impact of treatment A, given sequentially after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with operable breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
Between March 1991 and June 1999, 1863 women with stages I‐IIIA operable breast cancer who had undergone surgery and completed six cycles of adjuvant combination chemotherapy with either CMF, CAF, CEF, FAC or FEC were randomized to receive either treatment A for 3 years or no further treatment. Irrespective of menstrual status and hormone receptor content of the primary tumor, patients were stratified by institute, chemotherapy scheme and age (above 50 years or younger). The main end‐point was to detect a 5% increase in the 5 year survival (from 80% to 85%) in favor of treatment A. Secondary end‐ points were relapse free survival (RFS), local control, incidence of second primary breast cancer.

To assess whether the use of intervention A as an adjunct to colposcopy increases the detection of biopsy confirmed CIN 2, 3 (high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia).
Methods:
This is a multicenter two‐arm randomized trial comparing colposcopy alone with colposcopy plus intervention A. Patients were recruited from 13 colposcopy clinics in a variety of practice settings. 2299 women referred for the evaluation of an abnormal cervical cytology were randomized with stratification by cytology; subsequently 113 women were excluded for a variety of reasons. The main study outcomes were differences in true‐positive rates (CIN 2, 3 and cancer identified) and false‐positive rates between the study arms.
Results:
The true‐positive (TP) rates were 14.4% vs. 11.4% (p=0.035, one‐sided) for the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm compared to colposcopy‐only arm, respectively, in women with either an atypical squamous cell (ASC) or low‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) cytology result. TP rates were similar between the two arms among women referred for the evaluation of HSIL (high‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). The 26.5% gain in true‐positives observed with the use of intervention A and colposcopy among women referred for an ASC or LSIL cytology was achieved with only a fractional increase in number of biopsies obtained per patient (0.30) and a modest increase in false‐positive rate

In the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm among women with ASC or LSIL, the PPV (positive predictive value) of biopsies indicated by ntervention A was 15.0% and the PPV of biopsies indicated by colposcopy was 15.2%. Joint hypothesis testing indicates that intervention A and colposcopy provides benefit compared to colposcopy alone among women with ASC or LSIL.

In this randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial, patients were treated with six cycles of CAF therapy: 28 days/cycle, with doxorubicin (25 mg/m2) and fluorouracil (500 mg/m2) administered on days 1 and 8 and cyclophosphamide (100 mg orally [PO]) administered on day 1 through 14. Primary end point was overall response rate (ORR; partial or complete response). In total, 221 patients were assessable.
Results:
ORR was 42.6% for CAF compared with 53.1% for treatment A + CAF, a 24.6% relative improvement and 10.5% absolute increase (P = .077). There was a trend for prolonged progression‐free survival (PFS; median 241 days for CAF v 366 days for treatment A + CAF; P = .145). In retrospectively defined subgroups, significant improvement in PFS in favor of treatment A was observed in patients who were premenopausal, had no prior therapy, and were stage IV at diagnosis with an intact primary tumor. Except for neutropenia and leukopenia, there was no statistically significant excess of grade 3/4 adverse events compared with CAF. Treatment with treatment A did not affect the plasma concentration of doxorubicin.
Conclusion:
Treatment A + CAF was well tolerated and is suggested to have efficacy in patients who had not received prior therapy.",spin,"This passage describes a medical study about treating advanced or recurrent (hard-to-control) breast cancer. Here's a simplified explanation:

1. Goal: The researchers wanted to compare two treatments - one is ""Treatment A"" combined with standard chemotherapy drugs (CAF: cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil), and the other is just CAF alone. They checked how well each treatment worked and how well patients tolerated it (didn't have too many bad side effects).

2. How they did it: The study was designed like this: patients were randomly assigned (like flipping a coin) to either get Treatment A plus CAF or just CAF. Neither the patients nor the doctors knew who got which treatment (double-blind). The CAF drugs were given in six cycles, each lasting 28 days, with specific doses and schedules for each drug.

3. Main result: The overall response rate (ORR) - how many patients' cancer got smaller or went away - was 42.6% for CAF alone and 53.1% for Treatment A + CAF. This means Treatment A + CAF was better by 10.5% (absolute increase) or 24.6% (relative improvement), but the difference wasn't quite strong enough to be considered statistically significant (P =.077).

4. Other findings: Patients who got Treatment A + CAF tended to have longer times without their cancer getting worse (progression-free"

This study compared two treatments for advanced or recurring breast cancer in women. One treatment is called ""CAF"" (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil), which are three chemotherapy drugs combined. In this study, researchers added another treatment, ""treatment A"" (not specified by name here, but think of it as an additional medicine), to CAF in one group, while the other group received CAF plus a ""placebo"" (a dummy pill with no medicine).

The researchers looked at how well these treatments worked by measuring the ""overall response rate"" (ORR), which means how many patients' cancer got smaller or went away completely. They also checked for side effects and how long patients' cancer stayed under control without growing (called ""progression-free survival"").

The results showed that adding treatment A to CAF didn't make it significantly better than CAF alone. The overall response rate was 53.1% for treatment A + CAF and 42.6% for CAF + placebo, but this difference wasn't strong enough to say treatment A made a big difference. The time without cancer growth was 366 days for treatment A + CAF and 241 days for CAF + placebo, again not a significant difference. However, treatment A did cause more side effects, like neutropenia (low white blood cell count), which happened in 91.2"

In 1996, we initiated the multicenter phase III randomized trial to compare the effect on disease‐free survival (DFS) of experimental treatment A versus comparator B after breast‐conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer. This report presents the clinical results with a median follow‐up of 60 months.
Patients and methods:
Between February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery.
Results:
There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5‐year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis‐free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76). Nevertheless, in the node‐positive subgroup, the 5‐year LRFS was statistically better in the treatment A arm (97% in treatment A v 91% in comparator B; P = .02), corresponding to a risk of locoregional recurrence decreased by 39% (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.93).

- Both treatments also had similar results for preventing cancer from coming back locally (around the original breast site) and spreading to other parts of the body (metastasis), as well as overall survival (about 90-91% for both).

However, for women with cancer in their lymph nodes (node-positive), Treatment A was better at preventing local recurrence (97% vs 91% for Treatment B). This means Treatment A lowered the risk of cancer coming back near the breast by 39%.

In summary, this study shows that for high-risk breast cancer patients, Treatment A might be a better choice, especially for those with cancer in their lymph nodes. But overall, both treatments were similar in"

This phase III study compared the efficacy and safety of treatment A with comparator B in advanced breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
Patients were randomly assigned to treatment A or comparator B. Comparison of progression‐free survival (PFS) was the primary objective.

3. Results showed that both treatments had similar PFS times (about 8 months for each). They also found that the overall response rate (how many patients' tumors shrank) was 32% for both treatments, and overall survival (how long patients lived) was not different between the two treatments.
4. However, treatment A had a slightly longer ""time to treatment failure"" (TTF), meaning patients stayed on treatment A longer before it stopped working or they needed to switch to another therapy.
5. Both treatments had side effects, but treatment A had more severe drops in white blood cells (leukopenia) and required more blood transfusions. On the other hand, comparator B had more severe diarrhea, mouth sores (mucositis), and hand-and-foot syndrome.
6. Fewer patients stopped treatment A due to side effects compared to comparator B.

This phase III study compared the efficacy and safety of treatment A with comparator B in advanced breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
Patients were randomly assigned to treatment A or comparator B. Comparison of progression‐free survival (PFS) was the primary objective.
Results:
Patient characteristics were balanced between arms (N = 305). Median PFS was 8.05 months (95% CI, 6.60 to 8.71) for treatment A and 7.98 (95% CI, 6.93 to 8.77) for comparator B (log‐rank P = .121). Overall response rate (ORR) was 32% in both arms, p=0.931. The median time to treatment failure (TTF; defined as discontinuation, progressive disease, death as a result of any cause, or the start of a new anticancer therapy) was 4.24 months (95% CI, 4.11 to 4.44) for treatment A and 4.07 months (95% CI, 3.81 to 4.24) for comparator B, p=0.059. The medial overall survival was 19.29 months (95% CI, 15.57 to 23.59) for treatment A vs. 21.45 months (95% CI, 17.12 to 24.94), p=0.983.

Many cancer patients continue to smoke postdiagnosis, yet there have been few smoking cessation trials for this population.
Methods:
This double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial randomized 246 cancer patients to 9 weeks of placebo or treatment A, stratifying by pre‐treatment depression symptoms. In addition, all patients received transdermal nicotine and behavioral counseling. Primary outcomes were 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence, biochemically confirmed, at the end of treatment (Week 12), and at 6 months post quit day (Week 27). Additional outcomes included: withdrawal, affect, quality of life, compliance, and side effects.
Results:
There was no main effect of treatment A vs. placebo on abstinence (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.38‐4.81, p =0.64). At week 12, the abstinence rates were 24.2% for placebo and 27.2% for treatment A; at week 27, the abstinence rates were 17.4% for placebo and 18.4% for treatment A. There was no statistically significant difference between placebo and treatment A in average daily smoking to week 12 (mean [SE] 5.2 [0.95] vs. 5.3 [1.0]; p=0.97); and to week 27 (mean [SE] 5.4 [0.88] vs. 6.1 [0.90]; p=0.64). There were no statistically significant difference between placebo and treatment A on changes in withdrawals (p=0.39); negative (p=0.41) and positive affect (p=0.77), and physical (p=0.31) and mental (p=0.42) quality of life.
Conclusion:

This study looked at helping cancer patients quit smoking after they've been diagnosed. The researchers tested two approaches: a treatment called ""Treatment A"" and a dummy (placebo) with no active medicine, to see which one worked better for quitting. Both groups also received nicotine patches (transdermal nicotine) to ease withdrawal and counseling to support their efforts.

The main goal was to measure how many patients stopped smoking completely at specific points - after 12 weeks (end of treatment) and 6 months later. They also checked for differences in withdrawal symptoms, mood (positive or negative feelings), and overall quality of life between the two groups.

The results showed that Treatment A was not significantly better than the placebo in helping cancer patients quit smoking. At 12 weeks, about 24% of the placebo group and 27% of the Treatment A group had stopped smoking; at 6 months, it was roughly 17% for placebo and 18% for Treatment A. There were no significant differences in withdrawal symptoms, mood, or quality of life between the two groups either.

So, the conclusion is that Treatment A did not prove to be more effective than the placebo in helping cancer patients quit smoking after diagnosis."
41,20087643,A bupropion smoking cessation clinical trial for cancer patients,Cancer Causes Control,"Objective:
Many cancer patients continue to smoke postdiagnosis, yet there have been few smoking cessation trials for this population. Depression, which is prevalent among cancer patients, may be a barrier to cessation.
Methods:
This double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial randomized 246 cancer patients to 9 weeks of placebo or treatment A, stratifying by pre‐treatment depression symptoms. In addition, all patients received transdermal nicotine and behavioral counseling. Primary outcomes were 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence, biochemically confirmed, at the end of treatment (Week 12), and at 6 months post quit day (Week 27). Additional outcomes included: withdrawal, affect, quality of life, compliance, and side effects.
Results:
There was no main effect of treatment A vs. placebo on abstinence (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.38‐4.81, p = 0.64). Patients with depression symptoms reported significantly lower abstinence rates vs. patients without depression symptoms (OR = .14, 95% CI: 0.02‐0.80, p=0.03). Treatment A increased abstinence rates, vs. placebo, more for participants with depression vs. those without depression symptoms. For patients with depression symptoms, treatment A reduced withdrawal symptoms and improved quality of life vs. placebo.
Conclusion:
For patients with depression symptoms, treatment increases abstinence rates, lowers withdrawal, and increases quality of life. However, abstinence rates among patients with depression symptoms were low vs. patients without depression symptoms, who exhibited similar abstinence rates when treated with treatment A or transdermal nicotine and counseling alone. These results can guide future smoking cessation intervention studies with cancer patients.",spin,"Here's a summary for a fifth grader:

This study looked at helping cancer patients quit smoking. Even after being diagnosed with cancer, many people keep smoking, and not many studies have focused on helping them stop. The researchers thought that depression, which is common among cancer patients, might make it harder for them to quit.

In this study, 246 cancer patients were divided randomly into two groups: one got a special treatment (treatment A) and the other got a placebo (like a dummy pill). Both groups also used nicotine patches (transdermal nicotine) and received counseling to help them quit. The researchers checked if people had stopped smoking at 12 weeks (end of treatment) and 6 months later. They also looked at withdrawal symptoms, mood, quality of life, and side effects.

The main finding was that treatment A didn't make a big difference in quitting smoking overall. However, patients with depression symptoms had a harder time quitting compared to those without depression. But, for patients with depression, treatment A helped them quit more than the placebo did. Treatment A also made withdrawal symptoms less severe and improved quality of life for depressed patients.

In simple terms: This study shows that for cancer patients with depression, a special treatment (treatment A) can help them quit smoking better than just using nicotine patches and counseling. But, even with this treatment, quitting smoking is still harder for patients with depression compared to those without depression. This information can help design better quit-smoking programs"

Cancer‐related fatigue is a debilitating symptom affecting psychosocial functioning and quality of life in 70% to 100% of cancer patients during and after treatment. The authors examined the effect of 200 mg of treatment A compared to placebo on the severity of cancer‐related fatigue.
Methods:
The authors conducted a multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐ controlled, phase 3, clinical trial to examine the effect of treatment A on patient‐ reported fatigue in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. A sample of 877 cancer patients beginning chemotherapy at 23 geographically separate University of Rochester Cancer Center (URCC) Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) affiliates were assessed for fatigue. Patients who reported fatigue (N = 867) were randomly assigned to receive either treatment A or a placebo. Treatment began on Day 5 of Cycle 2 and ended after Day 7 of Cycle 4. Fatigue, sleepiness and depression were assessed during Cycles 2 to 4 by using psychometrically valid measures. The primary outcome was the worst level of cancer related fatigue during the previous week at Cycle 4. Group differences (treatment vs. placebo) were examined by using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusting for baseline fatigue (Cycle 2).

This study looked at a problem called cancer-related fatigue, which is extreme tiredness that affects almost all (70% to 100%) cancer patients during and after their treatments. The researchers tested a medicine called ""treatment A"" (we don't know its real name here, as it's just labeled ""A"" in the text) against a dummy pill called a ""placebo"" to see if treatment A could reduce this fatigue.

They did a big, careful experiment with 877 cancer patients from 23 different hospitals. Out of these, 867 patients reported feeling very tired, and they were randomly divided into two groups—one got treatment A, and the other got the placebo. They took these pills from the 5th day of their second chemotherapy cycle until the 7th day of their fourth cycle. The researchers measured their fatigue, sleepiness, and depression levels during this time.

The main question was whether treatment A made patients feel less tired by the end of the fourth cycle compared to the placebo group. But the results showed that treatment A didn't do a better job than the placebo in reducing fatigue—the tiredness levels were almost the same for both groups. However, treatment A did help patients feel less sleepy compared to the placebo group. Treatment A didn't have any effect on depression.

23,20564068,"A phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, clinical trial of the effect of modafinil on cancer-related fatigue among 631 patients receiving chemotherapy: a University of Rochester Cancer Center Community Clinical Oncology Program Research base study",Cancer,"Background:
Cancer‐related fatigue is a debilitating symptom affecting psychosocial functioning and quality of life in 70% to 100% of cancer patients during and after treatment. The authors examined the effect of treatment A on the severity of cancer‐related fatigue.
Methods:
The authors conducted a multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐ controlled, phase 3, clinical trial to examine the effect of treatment A on patient‐ reported fatigue in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. A sample of 877 cancer patients beginning chemotherapy at 23 geographically separate University of Rochester Cancer Center (URCC) Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) affiliates were assessed for fatigue. Patients who reported fatigue (N = 867) were randomly assigned to receive either treatment A or a placebo. Treatment began on Day 5 of Cycle 2 and ended after Day 7 of Cycle 4. Fatigue and depression were assessed during Cycles 2 to 4 by using psychometrically valid measures. Group differences (treatment vs. control) in the worst level of fatigue during the previous week at Cycle 4 were examined by using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusting for baseline fatigue (Cycle 2).
Results:
There were 631 patients (315 treatment A, 316 placebo) who provided evaluable data. ANCOVA showed a significant interaction between treatment condition and baseline fatigue (P = .017), where patients with severe baseline fatigue (n = 458) benefited from treatment A, whereas patients with mild or moderate fatigue did not. Treatment A had no statistically significant effect on depression (P > .05).
Conclusions:
Treatment A may be useful in controlling cancer‐related fatigue in patients who present with severe fatigue but is not useful in patients with mild or moderate fatigue.",spin,"Here's a simplified explanation for a fifth grader:

This study is about a problem called cancer-related fatigue, which is extreme tiredness that affects almost all (70% to 100%) cancer patients during and after their treatments. The researchers tested a treatment called ""Treatment A"" to see if it helps reduce this fatigue in patients undergoing chemotherapy (strong medicine to fight cancer).

They chose 877 cancer patients from different locations (23 University of Rochester affiliates) who were starting chemotherapy. Out of these, 867 patients reported feeling fatigued. The researchers then randomly divided these tired patients into two groups: one group got Treatment A, and the other group got a dummy pill (placebo) that doesn't have any real medicine in it. They started giving Treatment A or the placebo on the 5th day of the second chemotherapy cycle and stopped after the 7th day of the fourth cycle. They measured fatigue and depression levels during these cycles using special questionnaires.

The results showed that for patients with severe fatigue at the beginning (458 out of 867), Treatment A helped reduce their worst fatigue levels by Cycle 4. However, for patients with mild or moderate fatigue, Treatment A didn't make a difference. Treatment A also didn't affect depression levels.

In simple terms, this study found that Treatment A might help cancer patients who are extremely tired, but it doesn't help those who are only mildly or moderately tired."

The study aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of this combined approach (treatment A plus standard chemotherapy) versus standard chemotherapy alone (control arm).

In simpler terms for a fifth grader:
Imagine a big test with many hospitals working together. They're checking if adding ""treatment A"" to the usual strong medicines (cytarabine and idarubicine) helps people with a type of blood cancer (AML) more than just using those strong medicines alone. They looked at 260 patients, half got treatment A with the strong medicines, and half got only the strong medicines.

The main things they checked were:
1. How well patients responded to the treatment right away (complete response to induction).
2. How many patients were still alive after 3 years (overall survival, or OS).

The results showed:
- About 62.5% of patients in the treatment A group responded well initially, while 64.6% in the control group did; this difference wasn't significant (p=0.72).

Methods and material:
Patients with ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast carcinoma who were undergoing external beam radiotherapy to the breast or chest wall were randomly assigned to apply treatment A or placebo cream daily. The primary study endpoint was the provider assessed maximal grade of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, radiation dermatitis.
Results:

This study was about testing a cream (treatment A) to see if it helps reduce skin problems caused by radiation therapy in people with breast cancer. Radiation therapy can irritate the skin, especially on the breast or chest wall area being treated. The researchers compared this special cream (treatment A) to a dummy cream (placebo) that doesn't have any active ingredients.

They chose patients with breast cancer who were getting radiation treatment and randomly divided them into two groups: one group used treatment A cream daily, and the other group used the placebo cream. The doctors checked the patients' skin regularly during and after radiation therapy, looking for signs of skin irritation like redness, itching, or burning.

The study found that, although there wasn't a big difference in the overall worst skin irritation grades between the two groups, the patients using treatment A reported less itching, irritation, and burning sensations compared to those using the placebo. This suggests that treatment A might help reduce some of the uncomfortable skin side effects of radiation therapy for breast cancer patients.

So, in simple terms, this study tested a cream to see if it could make radiation therapy less irritating to the skin for people with breast cancer, and it found that the cream might help with some of the skin discomfort."

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment A in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer (OC).
Methods:
Patients with platinum‐refractory or ‐resistant primary or secondary) OC were randomized to receive treatment A and PLD at 50 mg/m2 intravenously or PLD alone at 50 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 every 28 days until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression‐free survival (PFS). Other end points were objective response rate and safety. The study was originally planned for 244 patients. The trial was temporarily placed on hold after 125 patients were randomized while the results of another trial were being reviewed and the sponsor decided not to resume enrollment. The interim analysis became the final analysis.
Results:
The median PFS was 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD (n = 65) versus 3.7 months for PLD (n = 60) (hazards ratio, 0.92; P = 0.7243). A preplanned subgroup analysis showed that 75 patients with platinum‐refractory or primary platinum‐resistant OC had a median PFS of 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD versus 2.9 months for PLD (hazards ratio, 0.55; P = 0.0425). Hematologic adverse events were 66% on the treatment A + PLD arm versus 44% on the PLD arm, manageable with dose reductions. Nonhematologic adverse events were similar for both arms. The incidence of palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis was lower on treatment A + PLD (23%, 31%, respectively) versus (39%, 49%, respectively) on PLD.

We examined the value of treatment A in a phase III trial with strict preoperative staging and surgical resection guidelines.
Patients and methods:
Patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagogastric junction (AEG II and III) were randomly assigned to treatment A followed by surgery or to surgery alone. To detect with 80% power an improvement in median survival from 17 months with surgery alone to 24 months with treatment A, 282 events were required.
Results:
This trial was stopped for poor accrual after 144 patients were randomly assigned (72:72); 52.8% patients had tumors located in the proximal third of the stomach, including AEG type II and III. The International Union against Cancer R0 resection rate was 81.9% after treatment A as compared with 66.7% with surgery alone (P = .036). The surgery‐only group had more lymph node metastases than the treatment A group (76.5% v 61.4%; P = .018). Postoperative complications were more frequent in the treatment A arm (27.1% v 16.2%; P = .09).

Conclusion:
This trial showed a significantly increased R0 resection rate but failed to demonstrate a survival benefit. Possible explanations are low statistical power, a high rate of proximal gastric cancer including AEG and/or a better outcome than expected after radical surgery alone due to the high quality of surgery with resections of regional lymph nodes outside the perigastic area (celiac trunc, hepatic ligament, lymph node at a. lienalis; D2).",spin,"Here's a simplified explanation for a fifth grader:

This passage is about a medical study (a phase III trial) that tested a treatment called ""Treatment A"" for people with advanced stomach or esophagogastric junction (where stomach meets esophagus) cancer, specifically types AEG II and III. The researchers compared two groups: one that received Treatment A before surgery, and another that had surgery without Treatment A.

The goal was to see if adding Treatment A would increase patients' median survival time from 17 months (with surgery alone) to 24 months. However, the study stopped early because not enough patients joined (only 144 out of the planned number), which affected its ability to show strong results.

Here's what they found:

We examined the value of treatment A in a phase III trial with strict preoperative staging and surgical resection guidelines.
Patients and methods:
Patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagogastric junction (AEGII and III) were randomly assigned to treatment A followed by surgery or to surgery alone. The primary outcome was overall survival.
Results:
This trial was stopped for poor accrual after 144 patients were randomly assigned (72:72); 52.8% patients had tumors located in the proximal third of the stomach, including AEG type II and III. After a median follow‐up of 4.4 years and 67 deaths, the median survival was 64.6 months (95% CI, 42.4 to NA) in the treatment A arm versus 52.5 month (95% CI 31.7 to NA) in the surgery alone arm (hazard ratio 0.84; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.35; P = .466). The survival rate at 2 year was respectively 72.7% (95% CI, 60.7‐81.7) and 69.9% (95% CI, 57.7‐79.2) in the treatment A and surgery‐only arm. The HR for progression free survival was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.49‐ 1.16; p=.20). The International Union against Cancer R0 resection rate was 81.9% after treatment A as compared with 66.7% with surgery alone (P = .036). The surgery‐only group had more lymph node metastases than the treatment A (76.5% v 61.4%; p = .018). Postoperative complications were more frequent in the treatment A arm (27.1% v 16.2%; P = .09).
Conclusion:
Treatment A followed by surgery was not more effective than surgery alone on overall survival in patients with locally advanced cancer of the stomach.",no_spin,"Here's a simplified explanation for a fifth grader:

This study looked at a specific treatment, called ""treatment A,"" for people with advanced stomach or esophagogastric junction (where the esophagus meets the stomach) cancer, classified as AEG type II and III. These are tough-to-treat cancers in the upper parts of the stomach area. The researchers compared two groups: one that received treatment A before surgery, and another that had surgery without treatment A beforehand.

The main goal was to see if treatment A, followed by surgery, improved how long people lived (overall survival) compared to just having surgery alone. However, after following 144 patients for about 4.4 years, they found that treatment A didn't significantly improve overall survival. People in both groups lived roughly the same amount of time after treatment.

Some additional findings:
- More patients in the treatment A group had successful removal of all cancer (R0 resection) compared to the surgery-only group.
- The treatment A group had fewer lymph node metastases (cancer spread to lymph nodes) than the surgery-only group.
- However, treatment A was associated with more postoperative complications (problems after surgery).

In summary, this study found that adding treatment A before surgery didn't lead to better overall survival for patients with advanced stomach or esophagogastric junction cancer compared to surgery alone. While treatment A had some benefits, like better surgical outcomes and fewer lymph node metastases, it"

Patients and methods:
One hundred and ninety‐two breast, gastrointestinal, and haematologic cancer patients were recruited before the trial closing prematurely (original target 352). Treatment A was administered before first treatment (intervention 1), 48 h after first treatment (intervention 2), and immediately before second treatment (intervention 3). Patient outcomes were measured at baseline (T1: pre‐education) and immediately preceding treatment cycles 1 (T2) and 3 (T3).

They tested Treatment A on 192 patients with breast, stomach, or blood-related cancers. The education program was given at three different times: right before the first chemotherapy, 48 hours after the first treatment, and right before the second treatment. The researchers measured patients' feelings and side effects before the education (T1), before the first treatment cycle after education (T2), and before the third treatment cycle (T3).

The results showed that Treatment A didn't significantly lower overall distress for patients. However, it did help decrease specific concerns (like worries about sensations, emotions, or procedures) and made vomiting less frequent, severe, and bothersome by the third treatment cycle (T3). For patients who were very distressed at the beginning, Treatment A seemed to help them feel better before the first treatment cycle (T2), but not as much by the third cycle (T3).

In summary, this education program (Treatment A) might be helpful in reducing some treatment concerns and side effects, but more research is needed with different types of patients to make sure it works for everyone."
