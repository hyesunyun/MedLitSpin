Randomized trial of fenretinide to prevent second breast malignancy in women with early breast cancer",J Natl Cancer Inst,"Background:
Treatment A has been shown to inhibit breast carcinogenesis in preclinical studies. We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.
Methods:
We randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30‐70 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66‐1.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64‐1.09; P = .177) between the two arms. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs (38 in the treatment A arm versus 40 in the control arm), incidence of distant metastasis (HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.79‐1.22; P = .858), and all‐cause mortality (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.92‐1.48; P = .215).
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than no treatment in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.",no_spin,"Sure! Here’s a simpler version of the passage:

Scientists wanted to see if a medicine called Treatment A could help women who had breast cancer avoid getting another breast cancer. They studied 2,972 women who had already had surgery for breast cancer. Half of the women took Treatment A every day for five years, and the other half did not take any medicine.

After following the women for about 8 years, the researchers found that there was no big difference between the two groups. The women who took Treatment A did not have fewer cases of new breast cancer compared to those who didn’t take the medicine. They also looked at other health problems and found no significant differences between the two groups.

In the end, the study showed that Treatment A did not work better than doing nothing to prevent a second breast cancer in these women."

The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. Other end points considered post hoc were the same outcomes stratified by menopausal status, incidence of distant metastases, overall mortality, and tumors in other organs. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (P =.642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (P =.177) between the two arms. However, an interaction was detected between treatment A and menopausal status in both outcomes (P for interaction in both outcomes =.045), with a possible beneficial effect in premenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66, and 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.41‐1.07; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 0.65, and 95% CI = 0.46‐0. 92) and an opposite effect in postmenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.32, and 95% CI = 0.82‐2.15; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.19, and 95% CI = 0.75‐1. 89). There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs, incidence of distant metastasis, and all‐cause mortality.

They studied 2,972 women aged 30 to 70 who had already had surgery for early-stage breast cancer. Half of the women took Treatment A for 5 years, and the other half did not take any treatment.

After about 8 years, the researchers looked at how many women got another breast cancer. They found that there wasn't a big difference between the two groups overall. However, they noticed something interesting: Treatment A seemed to help younger women (those who hadn’t gone through menopause yet) by reducing their chances of getting another breast cancer. But for older women (those who had gone through menopause), Treatment A might not help and could even be a little harmful.

In the end, the researchers said that while Treatment A didn’t seem to work for everyone, it might be helpful for younger women. They also mentioned that more studies are needed to be sure about these findings."

**Results:** 
- On average, patients who got only chemotherapy lived for about 30 months, while those who got treatment A plus chemotherapy lived for about 29 months. This means there wasn’t much difference in how long they lived.
- Patients who got treatment A plus chemotherapy had their treatment stop working after about 13.4 months, while those who got only chemotherapy had it stop working after about 10.3 months. This means treatment A might have helped a little bit, but not enough to be sure.
- The number of patients who got better (either completely or partially) was almost the same for both groups.
- Both groups had similar side effects, but there were some serious problems with treatment A.

Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with estrogen receptor (ER)‐positive or ER‐unknown metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization.
Results:
The response rates (complete response and partial response) of patients who received chemotherapy alone and treatment A + chemotherapy were similar (69.2% v 68.9%, respectively; P =.99). Time to treatment failure (TTF) was slightly longer for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone patients (13.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.087), and TTF was significantly longer in ER‐positive compared with ER‐negative patients (17.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.048). However, ER status had no effect on overall survival (30.0 months for chemotherapy alone v 29.3 months for treatment A + chemotherapy).

**What They Found:** 
- Both groups of patients (those who got just chemotherapy and those who got Treatment A plus chemotherapy) had similar success rates in getting better (about 69% for both).
- Patients who got Treatment A plus chemotherapy took a little longer before their treatment stopped working (13.4 months) compared to those who got just chemotherapy (10.3 months).
- For patients with a certain type of cancer (ER-positive), the time before treatment stopped working was longer than for those without that type (17.4 months vs. 10.3 months).
- However, in the end, how long people lived was about the same for both groups (30 months for just chemotherapy and 29.3 months for Treatment A plus chemotherapy).

**Conclusion:** So, for patients with a type of breast cancer that might respond to hormones, using Treatment A with chemotherapy helps them last a bit longer before the treatment stops working, but it doesn’t"

Efficacy and safety of treatment A was compared with comparator B in a group of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, without previous systemic therapy for advanced breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
The study was a prospective double‐blind randomized trial. All treated patients presented with positive estrogen receptors. Main end points were response rates, toxicity profile analysis, time to progression and survival. WHO and ECOG criteria were employed for response evaluation while toxicity was assessed according to WHO guidelines. Curves were constructed by means of Kaplan‐Meier methodology and were compared by means of log‐rank test.
Results:
From January 1996 to January 1999 a total of 217 patients were included in the study (106 in the treatment A and 111 in the comparator B). Both groups of patients were homogeneous regarding the main prognostic factors. A response rate of 64% (68/106) was observed in the treatment A group as compared with a 52% (58/111) in the comparator B group. Median times to progression and overall survival were not significantly different. A lower incidence of undesirable effects was appreciated in the treatment A arm.

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy with or without treatment A primarily on disease‐free survival (DFS) and secondarily on overall survival (OS) in patients with high‐risk operable breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
From June 1997 until November 2000, 604 patients with T1‐3N1M0 or T3N0M0 tumors were randomized to three cycles of epirubicin 110 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of treatment A followed by three cycles of 'intensified' CMF (cyclophosphamide 840 mg/m2, methotrexate 47 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 840 mg/m2) (group A), or to four cycles of epirubicin followed by four cycles of CMF, as in group A (group B).

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy with or without treatment A primarily on disease‐free survival (DFS) and secondarily on overall survival (OS) in patients with high‐risk operable breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
From June 1997 until November 2000, 604 patients with T1‐3N1M0 or T3N0M0 tumors were randomized to three cycles of epirubicin 110 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of treatment A followed by three cycles of 'intensified' CMF (cyclophosphamide 840 mg/m2, methotrexate 47 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 840 mg/m2) (group A), or to four cycles of epirubicin followed by four cycles of CMF, as in group A (group B). All cycles were given every 2 weeks with granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor support.
Results:
A total of 595 patients were eligible. Median follow‐up was 61.7 months for group A and 62 months for group B. The 3‐year DFS was 80% in group A and 77% in group B. Survival rates were 93% and 90%, respectively. The effect of treatment on the hazard of death was different according to hormonal receptor status. More specifically, in patients with negative receptor status the hazard of death was significantly higher for group B (hazard ratio 2.42). Both regimens were well tolerated and severe acute side‐effects were infrequent. No cases of severe cardiotoxicity or acute leukemia were recorded.
Conclusion:
The present study failed to demonstrate a significant difference in DFS or OS between the two treatment groups. However, our study has shown clearly that treatment A can be safely incorporated to dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy.",spin,"Sure! Here’s a simpler summary of the passage:

**Purpose:** The study wanted to see how two different ways of giving chemotherapy (a type of medicine used to treat cancer) affected patients with a serious kind of breast cancer. They looked at how long people stayed healthy after treatment and how long they lived overall.

**Patients and Methods:** From June 1997 to November 2000, 604 women with specific types of breast cancer were divided into two groups. One group got a special treatment called ""treatment A"" along with other medicines, while the other group got a different combination of medicines. Both groups received their treatments every two weeks.

**Results:** Out of the 604 women, 595 were able to be included in the study. The researchers followed up with them for about 5 years. They found that 80% of the women in the first group (with treatment A) were still healthy after 3 years, compared to 77% in the second group. Most women in both groups lived for a long time, with 93% of the first group and 90% of the second group still alive. They also noticed that women with a certain type of cancer had a higher risk of dying in the second group. Both treatments were mostly safe, and there were very few serious side effects.

**Conclusion:** The study didn’t find a big difference in how well the two treatments worked overall. But it did show that treatment A can be safely used with the"

To determine whether treatment A, improves survival in patients with brain metastases when used as an adjunct to whole‐brain radiation therapy (WBRT).
Patients and methods:
Patients with brain metastases from solid tumors and a Karnofsky performance score of > or = 70 were randomly assigned to receive WBRT with supplemental oxygen and either treatment A (treatment A arm) or no treatment (control arm). The primary end point was survival.
Results:
The study consisted of 515 eligible patients (treatment A arm, n = 265; control arm, n = 250). The median survival time (MST) was 5.4 months for the treatment A arm versus 4.4 months for the control arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87; P = .16). For the subgroup of patients with non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or breast cancer, the MST was 6.0 and 4.4 months, respectively (HR = 0.82; P = .07). Cox multiple regression analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of death for the treatment A arm in both primary populations. Further analysis indicated that the benefit may be restricted to the subgroup of patients with breast cancer. Response rates (radiographic complete response plus partial response) improved by 7% (P = .10) and 13% (P = .01) for all patients and for NSCLC and breast cancer patients in the treatment A arm, respectively. The most common severe adverse event in patients treated with treatment A was hypoxemia, which was reversible and effectively managed with supplemental oxygen in most patients.

These patients were split into two groups: one group got WBRT with treatment A, and the other group just got WBRT without treatment A. The main goal was to see how long the patients lived.

**Results:** There were 515 patients in the study. The group that got treatment A lived for about 5.4 months on average, while the group without treatment A lived for about 4.4 months. For patients with specific types of cancer (like lung or breast cancer), those who got treatment A lived a bit longer too. The study found that treatment A seemed to help, especially for patients with breast cancer. Some patients had side effects, like low oxygen levels, but doctors could help them with that.

To compare treatment A and comparator B in node‐positive, operable breast cancer patients.
Methods and materials:
This was a randomized, multicenter, phase III trial enrolling 638 eligible women with prior breast surgery and positive axillary dissection. Patients in Arm A received treatment A, with concomitant radiotherapy (50 Gy +/‐ 10‐20‐Gy boost). Patients in Arm B received comparator B, with subsequent radiotherapy.
Results:
Median treatment durations were 64 and 126 days (Arms A and B, respectively), with no significant difference in overall or disease‐free survival. Five‐year locoregional relapse‐free survival favored patients with conservative surgery (two thirds of the population), with less local and / or regional recurrence in Arm A than in Arm B (3% vs. 9%; p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis in this subgroup showed a 2.8‐fold increased risk of locoregional recurrence with comparator B, independent of other prognostic factors (p = 0.027). Febrile neutropenia and Grade 3‐4 leukopenia were significantly more frequent in Arm A. Subclinical left ventricular ejection fraction events at 1 year were more frequent with treatment A (p = 0.02).

**Results:** The women in Arm A finished their treatment faster than those in Arm B. Both groups had similar chances of surviving overall, but women who had the first treatment (Arm A) had fewer problems with their cancer coming back in the same area after surgery. In fact, only 3% of women in Arm A had their cancer come back, compared to 9% in Arm B. However, women in Arm A had more side effects, like a drop in white blood cells and some heart issues after a year.

Patients and methods:
Between March 1991 and June 1999, 1863 women with stages I‐IIIA operable breast cancer who had undergone surgery and completed six cycles of adjuvant combination chemotherapy with either CMF, CAF, CEF, FAC or FEC were randomized to receive either treatment A for 3 years or no further treatment. Irrespective of menstrual status and hormone receptor content of the primary tumor, patients were stratified by institute, chemotherapy scheme and age (above 50 years or younger). The main end‐point was to detect a 5% increase in the 5 year survival (from 80% to 85%) in favor of treatment A. Secondary end‐ points were relapse free survival (RFS), local control, incidence of second primary breast cancer.
Results:
After exclusion of all patients from three sites because of inadequate documentation, a total of 1724 patients (93%) were analyzed (Treatment A 861 and Control 863). At a median follow‐up of 6.5 years, 396 deaths (23%) and 602 RFS events (35%) (relapse and/or death) have been observed.

However, the new treatment didn’t help everyone equally. It worked better for women who had certain types of cancer, especially those with cancer that had spread to nearby lymph nodes or those whose cancer cells had specific markers (called ER and PR positive).

In the end, while Treatment A helped some women avoid their cancer coming back, it didn’t help them live longer overall compared to those who didn’t get the treatment. So, it was a little helpful, but not a big change for everyone."

To assess whether the use of intervention A as an adjunct to colposcopy increases the detection of biopsy confirmed CIN 2, 3 (high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia).
Methods:
This is a multicenter two‐arm randomized trial comparing colposcopy alone with colposcopy plus intervention A. Patients were recruited from 13 colposcopy clinics in a variety of practice settings. 2299 women referred for the evaluation of an abnormal cervical cytology were randomized with stratification by cytology; subsequently 113 women were excluded for a variety of reasons. The main study outcomes were differences in true‐positive rates (CIN 2, 3 and cancer identified) and false‐positive rates between the study arms.
Results:
The true‐positive (TP) rates were 14.4% vs. 11.4% (p=0.035, one‐sided) for the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm compared to colposcopy‐only arm, respectively, in women with either an atypical squamous cell (ASC) or low‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) cytology result. TP rates were similar between the two arms among women referred for the evaluation of HSIL (high‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). The 26.5% gain in true‐positives observed with the use of intervention A and colposcopy among women referred for an ASC or LSIL cytology was achieved with only a fractional increase in number of biopsies obtained per patient (0.30) and a modest increase in false‐positive rate
(4%). In the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm among women with ASC or LSIL, the PPV (positive predictive value) of biopsies indicated by ntervention A was 15.0% and the PPV of biopsies indicated by colposcopy was 15.2%. Joint hypothesis testing indicates that intervention A and colposcopy provides benefit compared to colposcopy alone among women with ASC or LSIL.

**Results:** The group that got the special treatment found more true cases of serious cell changes (14.4%) compared to the group that only had the colposcopy (11.4%). This means the special treatment helped find more problems. They also found that they didn’t have to do many more tests to get these extra results, and there was only a small increase in false alarms (4%). The special treatment and colposcopy together worked well for women with certain types of abnormal results.

Methods and materials:
In this randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial, patients were treated with six cycles of CAF therapy: 28 days/cycle, with doxorubicin (25 mg/m2) and fluorouracil (500 mg/m2) administered on days 1 and 8 and cyclophosphamide (100 mg orally [PO]) administered on day 1 through 14. Primary end point was overall response rate (ORR; partial or complete response). In total, 221 patients were assessable.
Results:
ORR was 42.6% for CAF compared with 53.1% for treatment A + CAF, a 24.6% relative improvement and 10.5% absolute increase (P = .077). There was a trend for prolonged progression‐free survival (PFS; median 241 days for CAF v 366 days for treatment A + CAF; P = .145). In retrospectively defined subgroups, significant improvement in PFS in favor of treatment A was observed in patients who were premenopausal, had no prior therapy, and were stage IV at diagnosis with an intact primary tumor. Except for neutropenia and leukopenia, there was no statistically significant excess of grade 3/4 adverse events compared with CAF.

**Methods:** They did a test with 221 patients. Half of them got the standard treatment (CAF), and the other half got the new treatment plus CAF. They looked at how well the treatments worked over six cycles, which lasted about 28 days each.

**Results:** The group that got the new treatment plus CAF had a better response (53.1%) compared to just CAF (42.6%). This means more people in the new treatment group showed improvement. They also found that people who were younger, hadn’t had treatment before, and had a certain type of cancer did even better with the new treatment. Most side effects were similar between the two groups, except for a couple of blood-related issues.

**Conclusion:** The new treatment combined with CAF seemed to work well and was safe for patients who hadn’t had treatment before.

**Purpose:** The study wanted to see if a new treatment (called Treatment A) combined with a standard cancer treatment (CAF) worked better than just the standard treatment with a fake medicine (placebo) for people with advanced breast cancer.

**Methods:** They did a test where some patients got the new treatment with CAF, and others got just CAF with the fake medicine. They looked at how well the treatments worked over six cycles, each lasting 28 days. They wanted to see how many patients got better.

**Results:** They started with 227 patients, but they could only look at 221 of them. The results showed that 42.6% of patients on CAF with the fake medicine got better, while 53.1% of patients on Treatment A with CAF got better. The time before the cancer got worse was about 241 days for the fake medicine group and 366 days for the Treatment A group. However, more people had side effects with Treatment A (95.5%) compared to the fake medicine (88.4%). One specific side effect, called neutropenia, happened more often with Treatment A.

**Conclusion:** In the end, Treatment A didn’t work better than the fake medicine when combined with CAF for patients with advanced breast cancer."

In 1996, we initiated the multicenter phase III randomized trial to compare the effect on disease‐free survival (DFS) of experimental treatment A versus comparator B after breast‐conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer. This report presents the clinical results with a median follow‐up of 60 months.
Patients and methods:
Between February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery.
Results:
There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5‐year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis‐free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76). Nevertheless, in the node‐positive subgroup, the 5‐year LRFS was statistically better in the treatment A arm (97% in treatment A v 91% in comparator B; P = .02), corresponding to a risk of locoregional recurrence decreased by 39% (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.93).

**Purpose:** In 1996, doctors started a big study to see how well two different treatments worked for women with early-stage breast cancer after they had surgery to remove the tumor. They wanted to find out which treatment helped women stay healthy longer without the cancer coming back.

**Patients and Methods:** From 1996 to 2000, 716 women joined this study. They started their treatments within 6 weeks after their surgery.

**Results:** After 5 years, both treatments worked about the same for most women. About 80% of women in both groups didn’t have their cancer come back. There were also no big differences in other important health measures. However, for a specific group of women whose cancer had spread to nearby lymph nodes, the first treatment worked better at keeping the cancer from coming back in that area.

**Conclusion:** The first treatment is still a good option for many women with breast cancer that can be treated with surgery. Doctors think it’s important to keep looking for new treatments that can help even more. 

So, in short, they were trying to find out which treatment was better, and while both were good, one was a little better for some women."

Treatment A is effective against HER‐2‐positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy of treatment A in HER‐2‐negative and HER‐2‐uncharacterized MBC.
Patients and methods:
Women with MBC were randomly assigned to first‐line therapy with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks plus treatment A or placebo. A preplanned retrospective evaluation of HER‐2 status was performed using fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP); secondary end points were objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), event‐free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS).
Results:
In the intent‐to‐treat population (n = 579), there were no significant differences in TTP, EFS, or OS between treatment arms, although differences in ORR and CBR were noted. In 86 HER‐2‐positive patients (15%), treatment with paclitaxel‐ treatment A resulted in statistically significant improvements in TTP, EFS, ORR, and CBR compared with paclitaxel‐placebo.

This double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial randomized 246 cancer patients to 9 weeks of placebo or treatment A, stratifying by pre‐treatment depression symptoms. In addition, all patients received transdermal nicotine and behavioral counseling. Primary outcomes were 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence, biochemically confirmed, at the end of treatment (Week 12), and at 6 months post quit day (Week 27). Additional outcomes included: withdrawal, affect, quality of life, compliance, and side effects.

**Objective:** Some people with cancer still smoke after they find out they have cancer, but there haven't been many studies to help them quit smoking.

**Methods:** In this study, 246 cancer patients were divided into two groups. One group got a real treatment (called Treatment A) for 9 weeks, and the other group got a fake treatment (placebo). Everyone also got help with quitting smoking and used a patch that gives them nicotine. The researchers wanted to see how many people stopped smoking after 12 weeks and again after 6 months.

**Results:** The study found that there wasn't much difference between the two groups in how many people stopped smoking. After 12 weeks, about 24% of the placebo group and 27% of the Treatment A group had stopped smoking. After 6 months, about 17% of the placebo group and 18% of the Treatment A group had stopped. They also looked at other things like how people felt and how their lives were going, but there were no big differences between the two groups.

**Conclusion:** Treatment A didn’t work better than the fake treatment for helping cancer patients stop smoking after they were diagnosed."
41,20087643,A bupropion smoking cessation clinical trial for cancer patients,Cancer Causes Control,"Objective:
Many cancer patients continue to smoke postdiagnosis, yet there have been few smoking cessation trials for this population. Depression, which is prevalent among cancer patients, may be a barrier to cessation.
Methods:
This double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial randomized 246 cancer patients to 9 weeks of placebo or treatment A, stratifying by pre‐treatment depression symptoms. In addition, all patients received transdermal nicotine and behavioral counseling. Primary outcomes were 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence, biochemically confirmed, at the end of treatment (Week 12), and at 6 months post quit day (Week 27). Additional outcomes included: withdrawal, affect, quality of life, compliance, and side effects.
Results:
There was no main effect of treatment A vs. placebo on abstinence (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.38‐4.81, p = 0.64). Patients with depression symptoms reported significantly lower abstinence rates vs. patients without depression symptoms (OR = .14, 95% CI: 0.02‐0.80, p=0.03). Treatment A increased abstinence rates, vs. placebo, more for participants with depression vs. those without depression symptoms. For patients with depression symptoms, treatment A reduced withdrawal symptoms and improved quality of life vs. placebo.
Conclusion:
For patients with depression symptoms, treatment increases abstinence rates, lowers withdrawal, and increases quality of life. However, abstinence rates among patients with depression symptoms were low vs. patients without depression symptoms, who exhibited similar abstinence rates when treated with treatment A or transdermal nicotine and counseling alone. These results can guide future smoking cessation intervention studies with cancer patients.",spin,"Sure! Here’s a simpler summary of the passage:

**Objective:** Some people with cancer still smoke even after they find out they have cancer. There haven't been many studies to help them stop smoking. One reason they might have trouble quitting is because they feel sad or depressed.

**Methods:** In this study, 246 cancer patients were divided into two groups. One group got a special treatment for 9 weeks, and the other group got a fake treatment (placebo). Everyone also received help with quitting smoking and used a patch that gives them nicotine. The researchers wanted to see how many people stopped smoking after the treatment and how they felt during the process.

**Results:** The special treatment didn’t help people stop smoking more than the fake treatment. However, people who felt sad had a much harder time quitting compared to those who didn’t feel sad. The special treatment did help those who were sad to stop smoking a little better than the fake treatment. It also helped them feel less bad when they tried to quit and made their lives a bit better.

**Conclusion:** For people with depression, the special treatment helped them stop smoking and feel better. But overall, people with depression still had a harder time quitting than those who didn’t feel sad. This study can help scientists create better ways to help cancer patients stop smoking in the future."

**Purpose:** The study wanted to see if a special cream (called treatment A) could help people who were getting radiation therapy for breast cancer, especially to reduce skin problems.

**How They Did It:** They took a group of patients with breast cancer and randomly gave them either the special cream or a fake cream (placebo) to use every day while they were getting treatment. Doctors then checked how bad the skin problems were.

**What They Found:** They had 176 patients in the study. The results showed that there was no big difference in skin problems between the people using the special cream and those using the fake cream. Both groups had similar levels of skin irritation. Some people reported feeling discomfort, but overall, the special cream didn’t help more than the fake cream.

**Conclusion:** The special cream didn’t work better than the fake cream for helping with skin problems during radiation therapy for breast cancer."

A two‐arm, double‐blind, randomized trial was performed to evaluate the effect of treatment A on acute skin‐related toxicity in patients undergoing breast or chest wall radiotherapy.
Methods and materials:
Patients with ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast carcinoma who were undergoing external beam radiotherapy to the breast or chest wall were randomly assigned to apply treatment A or placebo cream daily. The primary study endpoint was the provider assessed maximal grade of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, radiation dermatitis. The secondary endpoints included provider‐assessed Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Grade 3 or greater radiation dermatitis and adverse event monitoring. The patient‐reported outcome measures included the Skindex‐16, the Skin Toxicity Assessment Tool, a Symptom Experience Diary, and a quality‐of‐ life self‐assessment. An assessment was performed at baseline, weekly during radiotherapy, and for 2 weeks after radiotherapy.
Results:
A total of 176 patients were enrolled between September 21, 2007, and December 7, 2007. The provider assessed primary endpoint showed no difference in the mean maximum grade of radiation dermatitis by treatment arm (1.2 for treatment A vs. 1.3 for placebo; p = .18). Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events toxicity was greater in the placebo group (p = .04), primarily from pruritus. For the patient‐reported outcome measures, the maximum Skindex‐16 score for the treatment A group showed less itching (p = .008), less irritation (p = .01), less symptom persistence or recurrence (p = .02), and less annoyance with skin problems (p = .04).

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment A in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer (OC).
Methods:
Patients with platinum‐refractory or ‐resistant primary or secondary) OC were randomized to receive treatment A and PLD at 50 mg/m2 intravenously or PLD alone at 50 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 every 28 days until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression‐free survival (PFS). Other end points were objective response rate and safety. The study was originally planned for 244 patients. The trial was temporarily placed on hold after 125 patients were randomized while the results of another trial were being reviewed and the sponsor decided not to resume enrollment. The interim analysis became the final analysis.
Results:
The median PFS was 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD (n = 65) versus 3.7 months for PLD (n = 60) (hazards ratio, 0.92; P = 0.7243). A preplanned subgroup analysis showed that 75 patients with platinum‐refractory or primary platinum‐resistant OC had a median PFS of 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD versus 2.9 months for PLD (hazards ratio, 0.55; P = 0.0425). Hematologic adverse events were 66% on the treatment A + PLD arm versus 44% on the PLD arm, manageable with dose reductions. Nonhematologic adverse events were similar for both arms. The incidence of palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis was lower on treatment A + PLD (23%, 31%, respectively) versus (39%, 49%, respectively) on PLD.
Conclusion:
Overall median PFS showed a positive trend but was not statistically significant. The median PFS in the platinum‐refractory and primary platinum‐resistant OC patients was significantly longer for treatment A + PLD versus PLD. Treatment A may ameliorate the palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis known to be associated with PLD.

**Objective:** The study wanted to see if a new treatment (called treatment A) works well and is safe when used with a medicine called PLD for patients with a type of cancer called ovarian cancer that doesn’t respond to a common treatment.

**Methods:** They took patients who had this tough-to-treat cancer and split them into two groups. One group got treatment A along with PLD, and the other group got only PLD. They gave the medicine through an IV every 28 days until the cancer got worse or the side effects were too much to handle. They mainly looked at how long patients could stay without their cancer getting worse.

**Results:** They found that patients who got treatment A with PLD stayed without their cancer getting worse for about 5.6 months, while those who only got PLD stayed without it getting worse for about 3.7 months. This means treatment A seemed to help. They also noticed that some side effects were more common with treatment A, but they could be managed by lowering the dose. However, some side effects like skin problems were less common with treatment A.

**Conclusion:** Overall, treatment A seemed to help patients live longer without their cancer getting worse, especially for those with the hardest-to-treat cancer. They plan to do more studies to learn more about how well treatment A works and how safe it is.

This phase III trial assesses whether treatment A increases the duration of functional independence after surgery or radiosurgery of brain metastases.
Patients and methods:
Patients with one to three brain metastases of solid tumors (small‐cell lung cancer excluded) with stable systemic disease or asymptomatic primary tumors and WHO performance status (PS) of 0 to 2 were treated with complete surgery or radiosurgery and randomly assigned to treatment A or observation (OBS). The primary end point was time to WHO PS deterioration to more than 2.
Results:
Of 359 patients, 199 underwent radiosurgery, and 160 underwent surgery. In the radiosurgery group, 100 patients were allocated to OBS, and 99 were allocated to treatment A. After surgery, 79 patients were allocated to OBS, and 81 were allocated to treatment A. The median time to WHO PS more than 2 was 10.0 months (95% CI, 8.1 to 11.7 months) after OBS and 9.5 months (95% CI, 7.8 to 11.9 months) after treatment A (P = .71). Overall survival was similar in the treatment A and OBS arms (median, 10.9 v 10.7 months, respectively; P = .89). Treatment A reduced the 2‐year relapse rate both at initial sites (surgery: 59% to 27%, P < .001; radiosurgery: 31% to 19%, P = .040) and at new sites (surgery: 42% to 23%, P = .008; radiosurgery: 48% to 33%, P = .023). Salvage therapies were used more frequently after OBS than after treatment A. Intracranial progression caused death in 78 (44%) of 179 patients in the OBS arm and in 50 (28%) of 180 patients in the treatment A arm.

**Purpose:** The study wanted to find out if a new treatment (called treatment A) helps people stay independent and healthy for longer after they have surgery or special radiation for brain tumors.

**What They Did:** They looked at patients who had one to three brain tumors from solid cancers (but not small-cell lung cancer). These patients were treated with surgery or radiation and then randomly put into two groups: one group got treatment A, and the other group just watched to see what happened (this is called observation).

**What They Found:** They studied 359 patients. Some had surgery, and some had radiation. They found that the time until patients got worse (according to a health scale) was about the same for both groups. The average time was around 10 months for the observation group and about 9.5 months for the treatment A group. 

However, treatment A did help reduce the chances of the tumors coming back in the brain and also helped people live longer without dying from brain problems. But it didn’t help them stay independent or live longer overall compared to just watching.

**Conclusion:** So, while treatment A was good at stopping the tumors from coming back and reducing deaths from brain issues, it didn’t help people stay independent or live longer after their surgery or radiation."

We examined the value of treatment A in a phase III trial with strict preoperative staging and surgical resection guidelines.
Patients and methods:
Patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagogastric junction (AEG II and III) were randomly assigned to treatment A followed by surgery or to surgery alone. To detect with 80% power an improvement in median survival from 17 months with surgery alone to 24 months with treatment A, 282 events were required.
Results:
This trial was stopped for poor accrual after 144 patients were randomly assigned (72:72); 52.8% patients had tumors located in the proximal third of the stomach, including AEG type II and III. The International Union against Cancer R0 resection rate was 81.9% after treatment A as compared with 66.7% with surgery alone (P = .036).

Many people who have had cancer have trouble sleeping, and this can be a big problem. There are some medicines that can help with sleep, but they might not be safe to use for a long time, and some people don’t want to take them because they can have side effects and be expensive. 

In this study, researchers wanted to see if a new treatment (let's call it ""Treatment A"") could help cancer patients sleep better while they were getting treatment. They gave some patients Treatment A and others a fake treatment (called a placebo) for 8 weeks, and then they checked how well they were sleeping and how they felt.

They looked at different things, like how tired people felt and how their mood was. They had 227 patients start the study, but some left before it began. In the end, they found that Treatment A didn’t help people sleep better than the fake treatment. Both groups had similar results, and there were no big differences in side effects between the two groups.

So, the main finding was that Treatment A didn’t work better than the placebo for helping cancer patients sleep."

High levels of distress and need for self‐care information by patients commencing chemotherapy suggest that current prechemotherapy education is suboptimal. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of a prechemotherapy education intervention (treatment A) to assess impact on patient distress, treatment‐related concerns, and the prevalence and severity of and bother caused by six chemotherapy side‐effects.
Patients and methods:
One hundred and ninety‐two breast, gastrointestinal, and haematologic cancer patients were recruited before the trial closing prematurely (original target 352). Treatment A was administered before first treatment (intervention 1), 48 h after first treatment (intervention 2), and immediately before second treatment (intervention 3). Patient outcomes were measured at baseline (T1: pre‐education) and immediately preceding treatment cycles 1 (T2) and 3 (T3).
Results:
Treatment A did not significantly reduce patient distress. However, a significant decrease in sensory/psychological (P=0.027) and procedural (P=0.03) concerns, as well as prevalence and severity of and bother due to vomiting (all P=0.001), were observed at T3. In addition, subgroup analysis of patients with elevated distress at T1 indicated a significant decrease (P=0.035) at T2 but not at T3 (P=0.055) in treatment A patients.
Conclusion:
Treatment A holds promise to improve patient treatment‐related concerns and some physical/psychological outcomes; however, further research is required on more diverse patient populations to ensure generalisability.",spin,"Sure! Here’s a simpler summary:

Doctors noticed that many patients starting chemotherapy (a type of cancer treatment) felt very stressed and needed more information to help them. They wanted to see if giving patients better education before their treatment would help them feel less worried and deal with side effects better.

In a study, they invited 192 patients with different types of cancer to try a new education program before their first treatment and a couple of times after that. They wanted to see how this program affected their feelings and side effects like vomiting.

The results showed that while the education didn’t really help reduce overall stress, it did help some patients feel less worried about certain things and made them feel less sick from vomiting after their treatment. Some patients who were very stressed at the beginning felt a little better after the first treatment, but not as much after the second.

In the end, the study showed that this new education program could help patients with some of their worries and side effects, but more research is needed to see if it works for all kinds of patients."

Doctors noticed that many patients starting chemotherapy (a type of cancer treatment) were feeling very stressed and needed more information to help them. To see if giving patients extra education before their treatment would help reduce their stress, they did a study with 192 patients who had different types of cancer.

The patients were divided into two groups: one group got the usual care, and the other group received extra information (called Treatment A) at different times before their treatments. The researchers wanted to see if this extra information would help lower the patients' stress levels.

After looking at the results, they found that the extra education didn’t really help reduce stress compared to the usual care. However, some patients did feel less worried about certain things related to their treatment. But overall, most patients still experienced the same side effects from chemotherapy, like nausea and tiredness, whether they got the extra information or not.

In the end, the study showed that the extra education wasn’t more helpful than the regular care that patients usually get when starting chemotherapy."

Patients and methods:
Men with progressive mCRPC despite androgen deprivation were eligible and randomized 1:1. Patients received docetaxel (75 mg/m2 day 1) and prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily every 21 days with either treatment A or placebo twice daily orally on days 1‐3. The primary end point was overall survival (OS).
Results:
Two hundred and twenty‐one patients were randomly assigned. Median OS for treatment A plus docetaxel‐prednisone (ADP) and placebo‐DP was 18.1 versus 17.8 months [hazard ratio (HR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.72‐1.55, P=0.63].

A phase III study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) to evaluate the effect on response rate and survival of a treatment A.
Patients and methods:
Four hundred fifty‐six patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B in combination with 5‐FU (500 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) i.v., every 21 days for a maximum of six cycles (eight in case of CR).
Results:
Of 456 patients, 390 were evaluable for efficacy. Objective response (CR + PR) was seen in 57% (treatment A) vs. 41% (comparator B) of the evaluable patients (P = 0.003). The CR rate was higher in the treatment A arm (12% vs. 7%, P = 0.07). Treatment A produced significantly higher response rates in patients with visceral localization (50% vs. 34%, P = 0.011) and in patients with more than two metastatic organ sites (64% vs. 37%, P = 0.001). Median time to progression (7.6 vs. 7 months) and overall survival (18 months vs. 17 months) were similar. Myelosuppression was the principal toxic effect, with grade IV neutropenia observed in 57% of the patients treated with treatment A vs. 9% of those on comparator B. Grade IV infection or febrile neutropenia were observed in 8% (treatment A) vs. 0.4% (comparator B), but the incidence of septic death was the same in the two arms (two patients each). Cardiac toxicity was similar in the two treatment groups, with 5% vs. 3% of the patients taken off study due to cardiac events, primarily due to a decline in LVEF. Only three patients (two in treatment A) experienced congestive heart failure.

Here’s a simpler summary of the passage:

**Purpose:** The study wanted to see how well a new medicine (let's call it Treatment A) works for people with a serious type of breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.

**What They Did:** They had 456 patients and split them into two groups. One group got Treatment A, and the other group got a different medicine (we'll call it Treatment B) along with two other medicines. They received these treatments every three weeks for up to six times.

**What They Found:** Out of the 456 patients, they could check the results for 390. They found that 57% of the patients who got Treatment A showed improvement, compared to 41% of those who got Treatment B. Treatment A worked better for patients with cancer that had spread to many places in their body. 

However, both groups lived about the same amount of time overall, with Treatment A patients living for about 18 months and Treatment B patients living for about 17 months.

**Side Effects:** Treatment A caused more serious side effects, especially problems with the blood, like low white blood cell counts. This happened in 57% of the patients on Treatment A, while only 9% on Treatment B had this issue. There were also some heart problems, but they were similar in both groups.

**Conclusion:** The study showed that Treatment A can help fight the cancer better than Treatment B, especially for patients with"
