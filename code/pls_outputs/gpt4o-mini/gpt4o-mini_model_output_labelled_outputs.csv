Randomized trial of fenretinide to prevent second breast malignancy in women with early breast cancer",J Natl Cancer Inst,"Background:
Treatment A has been shown to inhibit breast carcinogenesis in preclinical studies. We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.
Methods:
We randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30‐70 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66‐1.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64‐1.09; P = .177) between the two arms. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs (38 in the treatment A arm versus 40 in the control arm), incidence of distant metastasis (HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.79‐1.22; P = .858), and all‐cause mortality (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.92‐1.48; P = .215).
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than no treatment in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.",no_spin,"Sure! Here’s a simple summary of the study for your fifth grader:

Scientists wanted to see if a medicine called Treatment A could help prevent women who had breast cancer from getting cancer again. They took a group of 2,972 women who had already had surgery for breast cancer and split them into two groups. One group took Treatment A every day for five years, and the other group didn’t take any medicine.

After watching the women for about 8 years, the scientists found that there wasn’t a big difference between the two groups. The women who took Treatment A didn’t have fewer cases of new breast cancer compared to those who didn’t take the medicine. They also looked at other health problems and found no big differences there either.

In the end, the study showed that Treatment A didn’t work better than doing nothing to stop breast cancer from coming back. So, the scientists concluded that this treatment wasn’t helpful for these women. 

Also, sometimes when people talk about studies, they might make it sound better than it really is, especially if the results aren’t very strong. So, it’s important to be careful and think critically about what the study really shows."

The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. Other end points considered post hoc were the same outcomes stratified by menopausal status, incidence of distant metastases, overall mortality, and tumors in other organs. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (P =.642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (P =.177) between the two arms. However, an interaction was detected between treatment A and menopausal status in both outcomes (P for interaction in both outcomes =.045), with a possible beneficial effect in premenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66, and 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.41‐1.07; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 0.65, and 95% CI = 0.46‐0. 92) and an opposite effect in postmenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.32, and 95% CI = 0.82‐2.15; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.19, and 95% CI = 0.75‐1. 89). There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs, incidence of distant metastasis, and all‐cause mortality.

Scientists wanted to see if a medicine called Treatment A could help prevent women who had breast cancer from getting another breast cancer. They studied 2,972 women who had already had surgery for early-stage breast cancer. Half of the women took Treatment A for five years, and the other half did not take any treatment.

After about 8 years, the scientists looked at how many women got another breast cancer. They found that there wasn’t a big difference between the two groups—meaning Treatment A didn’t really help most women. However, they noticed that it might help younger women (those who hadn’t gone through menopause yet) a little bit, but it seemed to have the opposite effect on older women (those who had gone through menopause).

In the end, the scientists said that while there might be some good news for younger women, they need to do more studies to be sure. They also warned that sometimes people can make results sound better than they really are, so we should be careful about how we understand these findings."

**Purpose:** The study wanted to find out if a new treatment (let's call it Treatment A) helps people with a type of cancer called metastatic breast cancer when used with regular chemotherapy (the usual cancer medicine).

**What They Did:** From 1988 to 1992, they looked at 231 patients with this cancer. Some patients got just chemotherapy, while others got both Treatment A and chemotherapy. They wanted to see how long people lived and how long it took before their treatment stopped working.

**What They Found:** 
- People who got just chemotherapy lived about 30 months on average, while those who got Treatment A plus chemotherapy lived about 29 months. This means there wasn’t much difference in how long they lived.
- The time before the treatment stopped working was a bit longer for those who got Treatment A (13.4 months) compared to just chemotherapy (10.3 months), but it wasn’t a big enough difference to be sure it was better.
- The number of people who got better (either completely or a little) was almost the same for both groups.
- Both treatments had similar side effects, but there were some serious problems with Treatment A.

**Conclusion:** Overall, using Treatment A with chemotherapy didn’t help people live longer than just using chemotherapy alone.

Efficacy and safety of treatment A was compared with comparator B in a group of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, without previous systemic therapy for advanced breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
The study was a prospective double‐blind randomized trial. All treated patients presented with positive estrogen receptors. Main end points were response rates, toxicity profile analysis, time to progression and survival. WHO and ECOG criteria were employed for response evaluation while toxicity was assessed according to WHO guidelines. Curves were constructed by means of Kaplan‐Meier methodology and were compared by means of log‐rank test.
Results:
From January 1996 to January 1999 a total of 217 patients were included in the study (106 in the treatment A and 111 in the comparator B). Both groups of patients were homogeneous regarding the main prognostic factors. A response rate of 64% (68/106) was observed in the treatment A group as compared with a 52% (58/111) in the comparator B group. Median times to progression and overall survival were not significantly different. A lower incidence of undesirable effects was appreciated in the treatment A arm.

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy with or without treatment A primarily on disease‐free survival (DFS) and secondarily on overall survival (OS) in patients with high‐risk operable breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
From June 1997 until November 2000, 604 patients with T1‐3N1M0 or T3N0M0 tumors were randomized to three cycles of epirubicin 110 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of treatment A followed by three cycles of 'intensified' CMF (cyclophosphamide 840 mg/m2, methotrexate 47 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 840 mg/m2) (group A), or to four cycles of epirubicin followed by four cycles of CMF, as in group A (group B).

The study wanted to see if a special kind of cancer treatment (called ""treatment A"") helped people with a serious type of breast cancer live longer without the cancer coming back, compared to another treatment that didn’t include ""treatment A.""

**What They Did:**
From 1997 to 2000, they looked at 604 women who had a certain type of breast cancer. They split them into two groups:
- **Group A** got three rounds of one medicine (epirubicin), then three rounds of ""treatment A,"" and then three rounds of another medicine (CMF).
- **Group B** got four rounds of just the first medicine (epirubicin) and then four rounds of CMF.

Both groups got their treatments every two weeks and had some extra help to keep their blood cells healthy.

**What They Found:**
After following the patients for about 5 years, they found that both groups had similar results. About 80% of the women in Group A and 77% in Group B didn’t have their cancer come back after three years. Also, most of the women in both groups were doing well and didn’t have serious side effects from the treatments.

**Conclusion:**
In the end, ""treatment A"" didn’t make a big difference compared to just the other treatment alone for these women with serious breast"

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy with or without treatment A primarily on disease‐free survival (DFS) and secondarily on overall survival (OS) in patients with high‐risk operable breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
From June 1997 until November 2000, 604 patients with T1‐3N1M0 or T3N0M0 tumors were randomized to three cycles of epirubicin 110 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of treatment A followed by three cycles of 'intensified' CMF (cyclophosphamide 840 mg/m2, methotrexate 47 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 840 mg/m2) (group A), or to four cycles of epirubicin followed by four cycles of CMF, as in group A (group B). All cycles were given every 2 weeks with granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor support.
Results:
A total of 595 patients were eligible. Median follow‐up was 61.7 months for group A and 62 months for group B. The 3‐year DFS was 80% in group A and 77% in group B. Survival rates were 93% and 90%, respectively. The effect of treatment on the hazard of death was different according to hormonal receptor status. More specifically, in patients with negative receptor status the hazard of death was significantly higher for group B (hazard ratio 2.42). Both regimens were well tolerated and severe acute side‐effects were infrequent. No cases of severe cardiotoxicity or acute leukemia were recorded.
Conclusion:
The present study failed to demonstrate a significant difference in DFS or OS between the two treatment groups.

**Purpose of the Study:**
The researchers wanted to see if a new way of giving chemotherapy (a type of medicine used to treat cancer) would help people with a serious kind of breast cancer live longer without the cancer coming back.

**What They Did:**
They looked at 604 women who had breast cancer and divided them into two groups. One group got a special treatment called ""treatment A"" along with their chemotherapy, while the other group just got the regular chemotherapy. They gave the treatments every two weeks and helped the patients with medicine to avoid getting sick from the chemotherapy.

**What They Found:**
After following the patients for about 5 years, they found that both groups had similar chances of not having the cancer come back and living longer. The group that got ""treatment A"" had a slightly better chance of not having the cancer come back (80% vs. 77%), but it wasn’t a big enough difference to say one treatment was definitely better than the other. They also found that both treatments were safe, and there were no serious side effects.

**Conclusion:**
In the end, the study didn’t show a big difference between the two treatments, but it did show that ""treatment A"" could be safely used with the chemotherapy.

To determine whether treatment A, improves survival in patients with brain metastases when used as an adjunct to whole‐brain radiation therapy (WBRT).
Patients and methods:
Patients with brain metastases from solid tumors and a Karnofsky performance score of > or = 70 were randomly assigned to receive WBRT with supplemental oxygen and either treatment A (treatment A arm) or no treatment (control arm). The primary end point was survival.
Results:
The study consisted of 515 eligible patients (treatment A arm, n = 265; control arm, n = 250). The median survival time (MST) was 5.4 months for the treatment A arm versus 4.4 months for the control arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87; P = .16). For the subgroup of patients with non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or breast cancer, the MST was 6.0 and 4.4 months, respectively (HR = 0.82; P = .07). Cox multiple regression analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of death for the treatment A arm in both primary populations. Further analysis indicated that the benefit may be restricted to the subgroup of patients with breast cancer. Response rates (radiographic complete response plus partial response) improved by 7% (P = .10) and 13% (P = .01) for all patients and for NSCLC and breast cancer patients in the treatment A arm, respectively. The most common severe adverse event in patients treated with treatment A was hypoxemia, which was reversible and effectively managed with supplemental oxygen in most patients.

**Purpose of the Study:**
The study wanted to find out if a new treatment (let's call it Treatment A) helps people with brain cancer live longer when they also get a type of radiation therapy called whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT).

**How They Did the Study:**
They took a group of patients who had brain cancer from solid tumors and were feeling pretty good (they scored 70 or higher on a performance scale). These patients were split into two groups by chance: one group got WBRT with Treatment A, and the other group just got WBRT without Treatment A. The main thing they were looking at was how long the patients lived.

**What They Found:**
- There were 515 patients in total: 265 got Treatment A, and 250 did not.
- On average, the patients who got Treatment A lived about 5.4 months, while those who didn’t live about 4.4 months.
- For patients with specific types of cancer (like lung cancer or breast cancer), those who got Treatment A lived a bit longer too.
- They also found that Treatment A seemed to help more for patients with breast cancer.
- Some patients had side effects, like low oxygen levels, but doctors could help them with that.

To compare treatment A and comparator B in node‐positive, operable breast cancer patients.
Methods and materials:
This was a randomized, multicenter, phase III trial enrolling 638 eligible women with prior breast surgery and positive axillary dissection. Patients in Arm A received treatment A, with concomitant radiotherapy (50 Gy +/‐ 10‐20‐Gy boost). Patients in Arm B received comparator B, with subsequent radiotherapy.
Results:
Median treatment durations were 64 and 126 days (Arms A and B, respectively), with no significant difference in overall or disease‐free survival. Five‐year locoregional relapse‐free survival favored patients with conservative surgery (two thirds of the population), with less local and / or regional recurrence in Arm A than in Arm B (3% vs. 9%; p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis in this subgroup showed a 2.8‐fold increased risk of locoregional recurrence with comparator B, independent of other prognostic factors (p = 0.027). Febrile neutropenia and Grade 3‐4 leukopenia were significantly more frequent in Arm A. Subclinical left ventricular ejection fraction events at 1 year were more frequent with treatment A (p = 0.02).

**Purpose:** The study wanted to see how well two different treatments work for women with a type of breast cancer that has spread to nearby lymph nodes.

**Methods:** They had a big test with 638 women who had already had surgery for their breast cancer. Some women got Treatment A along with radiation (which helps kill cancer cells), while others got Treatment B and then had radiation later.

**Results:** The women who got Treatment A finished their treatment faster than those who got Treatment B. Both groups had similar chances of staying healthy overall, but women who had Treatment A had fewer problems with cancer coming back in the same area after their surgery. For those who had less invasive surgery, Treatment A worked better, with only 3 out of 100 women having cancer come back, compared to 9 out of 100 for Treatment B. However, some women who got Treatment A had more side effects, like low blood cell counts and heart issues.

**Conclusion:** Treatment A is better at keeping cancer from coming back in the same area after surgery, and it takes less time, but it can cause a few more side effects.

Patients and methods:
Between March 1991 and June 1999, 1863 women with stages I‐IIIA operable breast cancer who had undergone surgery and completed six cycles of adjuvant combination chemotherapy with either CMF, CAF, CEF, FAC or FEC were randomized to receive either treatment A for 3 years or no further treatment. Irrespective of menstrual status and hormone receptor content of the primary tumor, patients were stratified by institute, chemotherapy scheme and age (above 50 years or younger). The main end‐point was to detect a 5% increase in the 5 year survival (from 80% to 85%) in favor of treatment A. Secondary end‐ points were relapse free survival (RFS), local control, incidence of second primary breast cancer.
Results:
After exclusion of all patients from three sites because of inadequate documentation, a total of 1724 patients (93%) were analyzed (Treatment A 861 and Control 863). At a median follow‐up of 6.5 years, 396 deaths (23%) and 602 RFS events (35%) (relapse and/or death) have been observed.

To assess whether the use of intervention A as an adjunct to colposcopy increases the detection of biopsy confirmed CIN 2, 3 (high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia).
Methods:
This is a multicenter two‐arm randomized trial comparing colposcopy alone with colposcopy plus intervention A. Patients were recruited from 13 colposcopy clinics in a variety of practice settings. 2299 women referred for the evaluation of an abnormal cervical cytology were randomized with stratification by cytology; subsequently 113 women were excluded for a variety of reasons. The main study outcomes were differences in true‐positive rates (CIN 2, 3 and cancer identified) and false‐positive rates between the study arms.
Results:
The true‐positive (TP) rates were 14.4% vs. 11.4% (p=0.035, one‐sided) for the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm compared to colposcopy‐only arm, respectively, in women with either an atypical squamous cell (ASC) or low‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) cytology result. TP rates were similar between the two arms among women referred for the evaluation of HSIL (high‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). The 26.5% gain in true‐positives observed with the use of intervention A and colposcopy among women referred for an ASC or LSIL cytology was achieved with only a fractional increase in number of biopsies obtained per patient (0.30) and a modest increase in false‐positive rate
(4%). In the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm among women with ASC or LSIL, the PPV (positive predictive value) of biopsies indicated by ntervention A was 15.0% and the PPV of biopsies indicated by colposcopy was 15.2%. Joint hypothesis testing indicates that intervention A and colposcopy provides benefit compared to colposcopy alone among women with ASC or LSIL.

The researchers wanted to find out if adding a special treatment (called intervention A) to a common medical procedure (called colposcopy) would help doctors find more cases of a serious condition called CIN 2 and CIN 3, which can lead to cancer.

**How They Did It:**
They did a big study with 2,299 women who had some unusual test results that needed checking. Some women had just the colposcopy, while others had colposcopy plus the special treatment. They looked at how many cases of CIN 2 and CIN 3 were found in both groups.

**What They Found:**
- The group that got the special treatment found more cases of CIN 2 and CIN 3 (14.4%) compared to the group that only had colposcopy (11.4%).
- This means that the special treatment helped doctors find more serious problems.
- They also found that the extra treatment didn’t lead to too many more unnecessary tests (only a small increase).
- The results were especially good for women with certain types of test results (ASC or LSIL).

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of treatment A plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) therapy in comparison with CAF alone, in patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
In this randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial, patients were treated with six cycles of CAF therapy: 28 days/cycle, with doxorubicin (25 mg/m2) and fluorouracil (500 mg/m2) administered on days 1 and 8 and cyclophosphamide (100 mg orally [PO]) administered on day 1 through 14. Primary end point was overall response rate (ORR; partial or complete response). In total, 221 patients were assessable.
Results:
ORR was 42.6% for CAF compared with 53.1% for treatment A + CAF, a 24.6% relative improvement and 10.5% absolute increase (P = .077). There was a trend for prolonged progression‐free survival (PFS; median 241 days for CAF v 366 days for treatment A + CAF; P = .145). In retrospectively defined subgroups, significant improvement in PFS in favor of treatment A was observed in patients who were premenopausal, had no prior therapy, and were stage IV at diagnosis with an intact primary tumor. Except for neutropenia and leukopenia, there was no statistically significant excess of grade 3/4 adverse events compared with CAF.

**How They Did It:** They had a group of patients and divided them into two teams. One team got Treatment A with CAF, and the other team just got CAF. They treated the patients for six cycles, which means they got the medicine for 28 days at a time. They wanted to see how many patients got better.

**Results:** They found that 53 out of 100 patients who got Treatment A with CAF showed improvement, while 43 out of 100 patients who only got CAF showed improvement. This means Treatment A seemed to help a bit more. They also looked at how long patients stayed healthy after treatment, and it seemed like those who got Treatment A stayed healthy longer, but the difference wasn’t super clear.

**Conclusion:** The study suggested that Treatment A combined with CAF is safe and might help patients who haven’t had treatment before. However, they also mentioned that some parts of the study weren’t strong enough to be sure about the results, so we should be careful about how we understand them.

**Important Note:** Sometimes, when studies share results, they might highlight things that sound good even if they aren’t super strong. So, we should"

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of treatment A plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) therapy in comparison with CAF + placebo, in patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
In this randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial, patients were treated with six cycles of CAF therapy: 28 days/cycle, with doxorubicin (25 mg/m2) and fluorouracil (500 mg/m2) administered on days 1 and 8 and cyclophosphamide (100 mg orally [PO]) administered on day 1 through 14. Primary end point was overall response rate (ORR; partial or complete response). In total, 221 patients were assessable.
Results:
A total of 227 patients were recruited, the full analysis set consisted of 221 patients. ORR was 42.6% (95% confidence interval (CI), 33.1 to 52.5) for CAF + placebo compared with 53.1% (95% CI, 43.5 to 62.5) for treatment A + CAF (P = .077). The median progression‐free survival (PFS) was 241 days for CAF + placebo v 366 days for treatment A + CAF; P = .145. Any adverse event occurred more frequently with CAF + treatment A, 95.5% vs. 88.4%, p=0.025. Neutropenia occurred for 91.2% with CAF + treatment A vs 77.7% with CAF + placebo, p=0.005.

**Purpose:** The study wanted to see if a new treatment (let's call it Treatment A) combined with a standard cancer treatment (called CAF) works better than just the standard treatment with a fake pill (placebo) for people with advanced breast cancer.

**How They Did It:** They had a group of people with breast cancer and split them into two groups. One group got Treatment A with CAF, and the other group got just CAF with the fake pill. They treated them for six cycles, which means they got the medicine for about six months. They looked to see how many people got better and how long they stayed better.

**Results:** Out of 227 people who started the study, they could really check the results for 221 of them. About 43% of the people who got just CAF got better, while about 53% of the people who got Treatment A with CAF got better. But the difference wasn’t big enough to say Treatment A really worked better. Also, people who got Treatment A had more side effects, like a drop in white blood cells, which can make you sick.

In 1996, we initiated the multicenter phase III randomized trial to compare the effect on disease‐free survival (DFS) of experimental treatment A versus comparator B after breast‐conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer. This report presents the clinical results with a median follow‐up of 60 months.
Patients and methods:
Between February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery.
Results:
There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5‐year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis‐free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76). Nevertheless, in the node‐positive subgroup, the 5‐year LRFS was statistically better in the treatment A arm (97% in treatment A v 91% in comparator B; P = .02), corresponding to a risk of locoregional recurrence decreased by 39% (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.93).

**Purpose:** In 1996, doctors started a big study to see how well two different treatments worked for women with early-stage breast cancer after they had surgery to remove the tumor. They wanted to find out which treatment helped women stay healthy longer without the cancer coming back.

**Patients and Methods:** From 1996 to 2000, 716 women joined this study. They started their treatments within six weeks after their surgery.

**Results:** After five years, both treatments worked about the same for most women. About 80% of women in both groups didn’t have their cancer come back. There were also no big differences in other important areas like how long they lived or if the cancer spread to other parts of their bodies. However, for a smaller group of women who had cancer in their lymph nodes, the first treatment worked better at keeping the cancer from coming back in the same area.

**Conclusion:** The first treatment is still a good option for many women with breast cancer who are at a higher risk of their cancer returning. Doctors think it’s a good idea to keep looking for new treatments that can help even more.

In short, the study showed that both treatments were pretty similar, but one was a little better for some women."

**What the Study Was About:**
Scientists wanted to see if a new medicine (let's call it Treatment A) was better than an older medicine (we'll call it Comparator B) for helping women who have a serious type of breast cancer that has spread. They looked at women who had already gone through menopause (which means they stopped having their monthly periods).

**How They Did the Study:**
They had 382 women take part in the study at 81 different places. The women were split into two groups randomly: one group got Treatment A, and the other group got Comparator B. They kept track of how long the women stayed healthy without their cancer getting worse (this is called progression-free survival or PFS).

**What They Found:**
- The women who took Comparator B had their cancer get worse after about 5.8 months, while those who took Treatment A had their cancer get worse after about 9.9 months. So, it seemed like Treatment A helped them stay healthier for longer.
- However, when they looked at how long the women lived overall, there wasn’t a big difference between the two groups. The women on Comparator B lived about 43.3 months, while those on Treatment A lived about 37.2 months.
- More women on Treatment A had a good response to the medicine (46% compared to 31% for Comparator B).

**Purpose of the Study:**
The study looked at how well a new treatment (called Treatment A) works for women with a serious type of breast cancer that has spread or is hard to treat.

**How They Did the Study:**
They took a group of women with this type of breast cancer and randomly divided them into two groups. One group got Treatment A along with a medicine called paclitaxel, and the other group got paclitaxel with a fake treatment (placebo). They wanted to see how long the women could go without their cancer getting worse and how well the treatments worked overall.

**What They Found:**
- They included 580 women in the study.
- The results showed that there was no big difference in how long the cancer stayed under control or how long the women lived between the two groups.
- However, more women in the Treatment A group had a good response to the treatment compared to those who got the fake treatment.
- Some side effects, like hair loss, rashes, and diarrhea, were more common in the group that got Treatment A.

**Conclusion:**
In the end, Treatment A didn’t help the women live longer compared to just using paclitaxel alone, even though it seemed to help some women feel better for a while.

This phase III study compared the efficacy and safety of treatment A with comparator B in advanced breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
Patients were randomly assigned to treatment A or comparator B. Comparison of progression‐free survival (PFS) was the primary objective.
Results:
Patient characteristics were balanced between arms (N = 305). Median PFS was 8.05 months (95% CI, 6.60 to 8.71) for treatment A and 7.98 (95% CI, 6.93 to 8.77) for comparator B (log‐rank P = .121). Overall response rate (ORR) was 32% in both arms, and overall survival (OS) was not different between arms (P = .983). Time to treatment failure (TTF; defined as discontinuation, progressive disease, death as a result of any cause, or the start of a new anticancer therapy) was superior in the treatment A arm (P = .059). Hematologic toxicity was similar in both arms, except for grades 3 to 4 leukopenia (treatment A, 78%; comparator B, 66%; P = .025) and transfusions (treatment A, 17%; comparator B, 7%; P = .0051). Grades 3 to 4 diarrhea, mucositis, and hand‐and‐foot syndrome were significantly higher in the comparator B arm.

Conclusion:
No difference was observed between treatment A and comparator B arms in PFS, ORR, and OS. TTF was longer in the treatment A arm.

- There were 305 patients in the study, and they were similar in both groups.
- Patients taking Treatment A lived without their cancer getting worse for about 8.05 months, while those on Comparator B lived for about 7.98 months. This difference wasn’t very big.
- Both treatments helped about 32% of patients, meaning the same number of people got better with either treatment.
- The time until patients had to stop treatment for any reason was longer for those on Treatment A.
- Some side effects (like low blood cell counts) were more common with Treatment A, but other side effects (like diarrhea and mouth sores) were worse with Comparator B.
- Fewer people stopped taking Treatment A because of side effects compared to those on Comparator B.

**Purpose of the Study:**
The study wanted to see if a new medicine (let's call it Treatment A) works better than an older medicine (we'll call it Comparator B) for people with a serious type of breast cancer.

**How They Did the Study:**
They took a group of patients and randomly gave some of them Treatment A and others Comparator B. They mainly wanted to find out how long patients could live without their cancer getting worse.

**What They Found:**
- There were 305 patients in the study, and they were similar in both groups.
- Patients taking Treatment A lived without their cancer getting worse for about 8 months, while those on Comparator B lived for about 8 months too. So, they were pretty much the same.
- Both treatments helped about 32% of patients, which is also the same.
- The time until patients had to stop treatment or their cancer got worse was about 4 months for both treatments.
- The average time patients lived overall was about 19 months for Treatment A and about 21 months for Comparator B, which means Comparator B was a little better, but not by much.

**Side Effects:**
Both treatments had some side effects, but Treatment A had more serious problems like low white blood cell counts and some other issues compared to Comparator B. More people had to stop Treatment A because of these side effects.

Results:
There was no main effect of treatment A vs. placebo on abstinence (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.38‐4.81, p =0.64). At week 12, the abstinence rates were 24.2% for placebo and 27.2% for treatment A; at week 27, the abstinence rates were 17.4% for placebo and 18.4% for treatment A.

**What the Study Was About:**
The study looked at cancer patients who still smoke after being diagnosed with cancer. The researchers wanted to see if a new treatment (called Treatment A) could help these patients stop smoking better than a fake treatment (placebo).

**How They Did It:**
They had 246 cancer patients take part in the study. Some got Treatment A, and some got the placebo, but neither the patients nor the doctors knew who got what (this is called double-blind). Everyone also got help with quitting smoking, like patches and advice. They checked how many people stopped smoking after 12 weeks and again after 27 weeks.

**What They Found:**
At the end of the study, about the same number of people in both groups had stopped smoking. Only a little more people stopped smoking with Treatment A (27.2%) compared to the placebo (24.2%) after 12 weeks, and the difference was not big enough to say Treatment A really worked. They also looked at other things like how people felt and how their lives were going, but there were no big differences between the two groups.

Many cancer patients continue to smoke postdiagnosis, yet there have been few smoking cessation trials for this population. Depression, which is prevalent among cancer patients, may be a barrier to cessation.
Methods:
This double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial randomized 246 cancer patients to 9 weeks of placebo or treatment A, stratifying by pre‐treatment depression symptoms. In addition, all patients received transdermal nicotine and behavioral counseling. Primary outcomes were 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence, biochemically confirmed, at the end of treatment (Week 12), and at 6 months post quit day (Week 27).

Results:
There was no main effect of treatment A vs. placebo on abstinence (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.38‐4.81, p = 0.64). Patients with depression symptoms reported significantly lower abstinence rates vs. patients without depression symptoms (OR = .14, 95% CI: 0.02‐0.80, p=0.03). Treatment A increased abstinence rates, vs. placebo, more for participants with depression vs. those without depression symptoms. For patients with depression symptoms, treatment A reduced withdrawal symptoms and improved quality of life vs. placebo.
Conclusion:
For patients with depression symptoms, treatment increases abstinence rates, lowers withdrawal, and increases quality of life.

**Summary:**

This study looked at cancer patients who smoke and whether a new treatment could help them quit smoking. Many cancer patients still smoke even after they find out they have cancer, and some of them feel sad or depressed, which makes it harder for them to stop smoking.

In the study, 246 cancer patients were divided into two groups. One group got the new treatment, and the other group got a fake treatment (placebo) that didn’t do anything. Everyone also got help with nicotine patches and advice on how to quit smoking.

The researchers wanted to see how many people could stop smoking after 12 weeks and again after 6 months. They found that the new treatment didn’t help everyone quit smoking better than the fake treatment. However, patients who felt sad had a harder time quitting than those who didn’t feel sad. But for those who were sad, the new treatment did help them quit a little better and made them feel better overall.

In the end, the study showed that while the new treatment helped some sad patients, many still had a tough time quitting smoking compared to those who weren’t sad. This information can help scientists learn how to better help cancer patients who want to stop smoking in the future. 

Also, when reading studies like this, it’s important to be careful because sometimes the results can be presented in a way that makes them seem better than they really are."

After following the patients for about 3 years, they found that both treatments helped people live for about the same amount of time—around 18 months. So, there wasn’t a big difference in how long people lived with either treatment.

They also noticed that some patients had serious side effects from both treatments, but a few more patients had side effects from treatment A.

Even though treatment A didn’t help people live longer overall, it might still be useful for some patients because it can help them feel better for a while. The scientists think it’s important to find out which patients might benefit from treatment A the most.

Cancer‐related fatigue is a debilitating symptom affecting psychosocial functioning and quality of life in 70% to 100% of cancer patients during and after treatment. The authors examined the effect of 200 mg of treatment A compared to placebo on the severity of cancer‐related fatigue.
Methods:
The authors conducted a multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐ controlled, phase 3, clinical trial to examine the effect of treatment A on patient‐ reported fatigue in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. A sample of 877 cancer patients beginning chemotherapy at 23 geographically separate University of Rochester Cancer Center (URCC) Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) affiliates were assessed for fatigue.

Treatment A may be useful in controlling cancer‐related fatigue in patients who present with severe fatigue but is not useful in patients with mild or moderate fatigue.",spin,"Sure! Here’s a simple summary of the passage for your fifth grader:

This study looked at how a new treatment, called Treatment A, helps people with cancer who feel very tired because of their illness and the medicine they take. Many cancer patients feel really tired, and this can make it hard for them to enjoy life.

The researchers wanted to see if Treatment A could help these tired patients feel better. They had a lot of people in the study—877 cancer patients—and they split them into two groups. One group got Treatment A, and the other group got a fake treatment (like a sugar pill) that wouldn’t help them.

They checked how tired the patients felt during their treatment. They found that Treatment A helped patients who were very tired at the start feel less tired by the end of the study. But it didn’t help those who were only a little tired. Also, Treatment A didn’t seem to help with feelings of sadness.

In the end, the researchers think Treatment A could be good for people who are really, really tired from cancer, but it doesn’t help those who are just a bit tired. 

The passage also warns that sometimes studies can be presented in a way that makes them sound better than they really are, so we should be careful about believing everything we read about them."

The characteristics of the 260 patients randomized to cytarabine and idarubicine with treatment A or cytarabine and idarubicine alone (control arm) were similar in both arms. 62.5% of patients randomized in the treatment A arm had a complete response to induction vs. 64.6% in the control arm; p=0.72. The three‐year OS rates were not statistically significantly different between treatment A and control arm (25.6 +/‐ 5.1% vs. 31.8 +/‐ 5.6%; p=0.38.

Here’s a simple summary for your fifth grader:

This study looked at a new treatment (let's call it Treatment A) to see if it helps people with a type of blood cancer called acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The researchers wanted to find out if Treatment A worked better than the usual medicines, which are called cytarabine and idarubicine.

They had 260 patients in the study. Some got Treatment A along with the usual medicines, and some just got the usual medicines. After looking at the results, they found that about the same number of people got better in both groups. In the group with Treatment A, 62.5% got better, and in the group without it, 64.6% got better. That means Treatment A didn’t really make a big difference.

They also checked how many people were still alive after three years. The results were similar too: 25.6% of people with Treatment A were still alive, compared to 31.8% of those without it. Again, this shows that Treatment A didn’t help more than the usual medicines.

The study also mentions that sometimes people might try to make the results sound better than they really are, especially if the numbers don’t show a clear benefit. So, it’s important to be careful and think critically about what the study is saying.

In short, Treatment A didn’t work better than the usual treatment for this type of cancer."

Here’s a simple summary for your fifth grader:

This passage talks about a study that looked at a new treatment (let's call it Treatment A) for a type of blood cancer called AML. The researchers wanted to see if Treatment A helped people feel better and live longer when they were getting their first treatment for AML.

In the study, they found that Treatment A helped reduce a problem called leukopenia, which means having low white blood cells. However, when they looked at how long people lived after three years, the results were pretty similar for both groups of patients, whether they got Treatment A or not. But they noticed that women did better than men in this study.

The researchers also found some important things that seemed to help people live longer, like using Treatment A, being female, and having just one round of the first treatment. But they need to check more to understand why women did better.

Finally, the passage warns that sometimes studies can be tricky. They might highlight certain results to make them sound better than they really are, so we should be careful and think critically about what the study is saying."

A two‐arm, double‐blind, randomized trial was performed to evaluate the effect of treatment A on acute skin‐related toxicity in patients undergoing breast or chest wall radiotherapy.
Methods and material:
Patients with ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast carcinoma who were undergoing external beam radiotherapy to the breast or chest wall were randomly assigned to apply treatment A or placebo cream daily. The primary study endpoint was the provider assessed maximal grade of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, radiation dermatitis.
Results:
A total of 176 patients were enrolled between September 21, 2007, and December 7, 2007. The provider assessed primary endpoint showed no difference in the mean maximum grade of radiation dermatitis by treatment arm (1.2+/‐0.85 for treatment A vs. 1.3+/‐0.80 for placebo; p = .18). Severe radiation dermatitis concerned 4 (5%) in both arms; p=.97. The worst grade of any type of toxicity were respectively in the placebo and treatment A groups 9% vs. 2% for grade 3 or 4: 24% vs. 30% for grade 2; 61% vs. 40% for grade 1; and 6% vs. 27% for grade 0; p = .04.

**How They Did It:**
They took a group of 176 patients who had breast cancer and randomly divided them into two groups. One group used the special cream, and the other group used a fake cream (placebo) that didn’t have any medicine in it. They checked how bad the skin problems were for both groups.

**What They Found:**
After looking at the results, they found that there wasn’t much difference between the two groups. Both groups had similar levels of skin problems. For example, the average skin problem score was about the same for both groups. They also looked at how the patients felt about their skin and their overall quality of life, and again, there wasn’t much difference.

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment A in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer (OC).
Methods:
Patients with platinum‐refractory or ‐resistant primary or secondary) OC were randomized to receive treatment A and PLD at 50 mg/m2 intravenously or PLD alone at 50 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 every 28 days until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression‐free survival (PFS). Other end points were objective response rate and safety. The study was originally planned for 244 patients. The trial was temporarily placed on hold after 125 patients were randomized while the results of another trial were being reviewed and the sponsor decided not to resume enrollment. The interim analysis became the final analysis.
Results:
The median PFS was 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD (n = 65) versus 3.7 months for PLD (n = 60) (hazards ratio, 0.92; P = 0.7243). A preplanned subgroup analysis showed that 75 patients with platinum‐refractory or primary platinum‐resistant OC had a median PFS of 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD versus 2.9 months for PLD (hazards ratio, 0.55; P = 0.0425). Hematologic adverse events were 66% on the treatment A + PLD arm versus 44% on the PLD arm, manageable with dose reductions. Nonhematologic adverse events were similar for both arms. The incidence of palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis was lower on treatment A + PLD (23%, 31%, respectively) versus (39%, 49%, respectively) on PLD.
Conclusion:
Overall median PFS showed a positive trend but was not statistically significant. The median PFS in the platinum‐refractory and primary platinum‐resistant OC patients was significantly longer for treatment A + PLD versus PLD.

This phase III trial assesses whether treatment A increases the duration of functional independence after surgery or radiosurgery of brain metastases.
Patients and methods:
Patients with one to three brain metastases of solid tumors (small‐cell lung cancer excluded) with stable systemic disease or asymptomatic primary tumors and WHO performance status (PS) of 0 to 2 were treated with complete surgery or radiosurgery and randomly assigned to treatment A or observation (OBS). The primary end point was time to WHO PS deterioration to more than 2.
Results:
Of 359 patients, 199 underwent radiosurgery, and 160 underwent surgery. In the radiosurgery group, 100 patients were allocated to OBS, and 99 were allocated to treatment A. After surgery, 79 patients were allocated to OBS, and 81 were allocated to treatment A. The median time to WHO PS more than 2 was 10.0 months (95% CI, 8.1 to 11.7 months) after OBS and 9.5 months (95% CI, 7.8 to 11.9 months) after treatment A (P = .71). Overall survival was similar in the treatment A and OBS arms (median, 10.9 v 10.7 months, respectively; P = .89).

We examined the value of treatment A in a phase III trial with strict preoperative staging and surgical resection guidelines.
Patients and methods:
Patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagogastric junction (AEG II and III) were randomly assigned to treatment A followed by surgery or to surgery alone. To detect with 80% power an improvement in median survival from 17 months with surgery alone to 24 months with treatment A, 282 events were required.
Results:
This trial was stopped for poor accrual after 144 patients were randomly assigned (72:72); 52.8% patients had tumors located in the proximal third of the stomach, including AEG type II and III. The International Union against Cancer R0 resection rate was 81.9% after treatment A as compared with 66.7% with surgery alone (P = .036). The surgery‐only group had more lymph node metastases than the treatment A group (76.5% v 61.4%; P = .018). Postoperative complications were more frequent in the treatment A arm (27.1% v 16.2%; P = .09). After a median follow‐up of 4.4 years and 67 deaths, a survival benefit could not be shown (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.35; P = .466).
Conclusion:
This trial showed a significantly increased R0 resection rate but failed to demonstrate a survival benefit. Possible explanations are low statistical power, a high rate of proximal gastric cancer including AEG and/or a better outcome than expected after radical surgery alone due to the high quality of surgery with resections of regional lymph nodes outside the perigastic area (celiac trunc, hepatic ligament, lymph node at a. lienalis; D2).",spin,"Sure! Here’s a simple summary of the passage for your fifth grader:

**Purpose of the Study:**
The researchers wanted to see if a new treatment (let's call it Treatment A) could help people with a type of stomach cancer live longer when combined with surgery.

**How They Did the Study:**
They took patients with advanced stomach cancer and randomly split them into two groups. One group got Treatment A before their surgery, and the other group just had surgery without the treatment. They wanted to find out if the people who got Treatment A would live longer than those who only had surgery.

**What They Found:**
Unfortunately, the study had to stop early because not enough people joined. They had 144 patients instead of the 282 they needed. They found that more people in the Treatment A group had their cancer completely removed during surgery compared to the surgery-only group. However, the group that only had surgery had more cancer spread to their lymph nodes.

After following the patients for about 4.4 years, they didn’t find that Treatment A helped people live longer. They thought maybe the results were not strong enough to be sure, or that the surgery alone was better than they expected.

**Conclusion:**
Even though Treatment A helped with surgery, it didn’t show that it made people live longer. The researchers said we should be careful about how we understand these results because sometimes studies can be presented in a way that makes them seem better than they really are.

Treatment A followed by surgery was not more effective than surgery alone on overall survival in patients with locally advanced cancer of the stomach.",no_spin,"Sure! Here’s a simple summary of the passage for your fifth grader:

**Purpose of the Study:**
The researchers wanted to see if a new treatment (let's call it Treatment A) could help people with a type of stomach cancer before they had surgery.

**What They Did:**
They took a group of patients with advanced stomach cancer and split them into two groups. One group got Treatment A before their surgery, and the other group just had surgery without the treatment. They wanted to find out which group lived longer after their treatment.

**What They Found:**
The study had to stop early because not enough people joined. They had 144 patients in total, with about half getting Treatment A and half just having surgery. After following the patients for about 4.4 years, they found that the group that got Treatment A lived about 64.6 months on average, while the surgery-only group lived about 52.5 months. However, this difference wasn't considered strong enough to say Treatment A was better.

They also looked at other things, like how many patients had complications after surgery and how many had cancer spread to their lymph nodes. The group that got Treatment A had fewer cases of cancer spreading to lymph nodes but had more complications after surgery.

**Conclusion:**
In the end, the researchers decided that Treatment A didn’t help people live longer compared to just having surgery alone.

Sometimes, when studies like this are shared, they might highlight certain results"

A total of 227 patients were randomized into this study between March 19, 2004, and March 9, 2007, with 119 being evaluable for the primary end point. The AUC over the 8 weeks for treatment A was 51.4 (SD = 16), while that for placebo was 49.7 (SD = 15), with a P value of 0.6957. A supplemental, exploratory analysis revealed that several fatigue end points, as measured by the BFI and POMS, were significantly better for those taking treatment A over placebo. Participants also reported less trouble with sleep and less drowsiness on treatment A than placebo. There were no significant differences in toxicities as measured by self‐report or the CTCAE except for mild alkaline phosphatase increases, which were slightly more common in the placebo group. This study failed to provide data to support the hypothesis that treatment A, at bedtime could improve sleep as measured by the PSQI.

The study looked at how a new treatment (let's call it ""treatment A"") could help people with cancer sleep better while they were getting treatment. Many cancer survivors have trouble sleeping, and while there are medicines that can help, they often have side effects and can be expensive. 

In this study, some people took treatment A, and others took a fake pill (called a placebo) that didn’t have any medicine in it. They took these pills for 8 weeks before bedtime. The researchers wanted to see if treatment A helped them sleep better and feel less tired.

They asked the participants questions about their sleep and how they felt at the beginning of the study and again after 4 and 8 weeks. They found that treatment A didn’t really help with sleep as much as they hoped, but some people who took it did feel less tired and had better moods compared to those who took the placebo. 

Overall, the study didn’t show that treatment A was great for sleep, but it might help with feeling tired. The researchers think it’s worth looking into this treatment more in the future."

This passage talks about a study that looked at how well a new treatment helps people with cancer sleep better. Many people who have had cancer have trouble sleeping, and doctors want to find safe ways to help them without using strong medicines that can have bad side effects.

In the study, some people got the new treatment, while others got a fake treatment (like a sugar pill) that didn’t do anything. They took these treatments for 8 weeks, and the researchers asked them questions about their sleep and how they felt.

The study included 227 people, but some left before starting the treatment. In the end, the researchers found that the new treatment didn’t help people sleep better than the fake treatment. They also checked for any side effects, and there weren’t any big differences between the two groups.

So, the main point is that the new treatment didn’t work better than the fake one for helping cancer patients sleep."

High levels of distress and need for self‐care information by patients commencing chemotherapy suggest that current prechemotherapy education is suboptimal. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of a prechemotherapy education intervention (treatment A) to assess impact on patient distress, treatment‐related concerns, and the prevalence and severity of and bother caused by six chemotherapy side‐effects.
Patients and methods:
One hundred and ninety‐two breast, gastrointestinal, and haematologic cancer patients were recruited before the trial closing prematurely (original target 352). Treatment A was administered before first treatment (intervention 1), 48 h after first treatment (intervention 2), and immediately before second treatment (intervention 3). Patient outcomes were measured at baseline (T1: pre‐education) and immediately preceding treatment cycles 1 (T2) and 3 (T3).
Results:
Treatment A did not significantly reduce patient distress. However, a significant decrease in sensory/psychological (P=0.027) and procedural (P=0.03) concerns, as well as prevalence and severity of and bother due to vomiting (all P=0.001), were observed at T3. In addition, subgroup analysis of patients with elevated distress at T1 indicated a significant decrease (P=0.035) at T2 but not at T3 (P=0.055) in treatment A patients.

This study looked at how well a special education program helped cancer patients who were about to start chemotherapy, which is a type of medicine that helps fight cancer. The researchers wanted to see if this program could make patients feel less worried and help them deal with side effects like feeling sick.

They started with 192 patients but had to stop the study early because they didn’t get as many people as they wanted. The patients got the education before their first treatment, two days after, and right before their second treatment. The researchers checked how the patients felt before and after these treatments.

In the end, the special education program didn’t really help reduce how worried the patients felt overall. However, it did help some patients feel less concerned about certain things, like feeling sick to their stomach. For patients who were really worried at the beginning, they felt a little better after the first treatment, but not as much after the second.

The researchers think that this program might help with some worries and side effects, but they need to do more studies with different kinds of patients to see if it works for everyone. 

Also, it’s important to be careful when reading about studies like this because sometimes the results can be presented in a way that makes them sound better than they really are."
