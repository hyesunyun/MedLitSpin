Randomized trial of fenretinide to prevent second breast malignancy in women with early breast cancer",J Natl Cancer Inst,"Background:
Treatment A has been shown to inhibit breast carcinogenesis in preclinical studies. We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.
Methods:
We randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30‐70 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66‐1.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64‐1.09; P = .177) between the two arms. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs (38 in the treatment A arm versus 40 in the control arm), incidence of distant metastasis (HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.79‐1.22; P = .858), and all‐cause mortality (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.92‐1.48; P = .215).
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than no treatment in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.",no_spin,"Sure! Here's a simple way to explain it:

Scientists wanted to see if a medicine, called Treatment A, could help stop women who had breast cancer from getting it again. They did a big study with almost 3,000 women who had their breast cancer removed by surgery. Half of the women took Treatment A every day for five years, and the other half didn't take it.

After about eight years, the scientists checked to see if the women who took Treatment A were less likely to get breast cancer again compared to those who didn't take it. They found that there wasn't much difference between the two groups. The women who took Treatment A didn't have fewer new breast cancer cases or other health problems than the women who didn't take it.

So, the scientists concluded that Treatment A didn't really help in stopping breast cancer from coming back."

The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. Other end points considered post hoc were the same outcomes stratified by menopausal status, incidence of distant metastases, overall mortality, and tumors in other organs. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (P =.642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (P =.177) between the two arms. However, an interaction was detected between treatment A and menopausal status in both outcomes (P for interaction in both outcomes =.045), with a possible beneficial effect in premenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66, and 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.41‐1.07; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 0.65, and 95% CI = 0.46‐0. 92) and an opposite effect in postmenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.32, and 95% CI = 0.82‐2.15; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.19, and 95% CI = 0.75‐1. 89). There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs, incidence of distant metastasis, and all‐cause mortality.
Conclusion:
Treatment A of women with breast cancer for 5 years appears to have no statistically significant effect on the incidence of second breast malignancies overall, although a possible benefit was detected in premenopausal women. These studies, particularly the post hoc analyses, are considered exploratory and need to be confirmed.",spin,"Sure! Here's a simple way to explain it:

Scientists wanted to see if a medicine called Treatment A could help stop women who already had breast cancer from getting it again. They did a study with almost 3,000 women who had early-stage breast cancer. Some of the women took Treatment A every day for five years, and some didn't take it at all.

After about eight years, the scientists checked to see if there was a difference in how many women got breast cancer again. They found that, overall, Treatment A didn't make a big difference. But, when they looked closer, they noticed that the medicine might help women who haven't gone through menopause yet (that's when a woman's body stops having periods). For these women, the medicine seemed to lower the chance of getting breast cancer again. However, for women who had already gone through menopause, the medicine didn't seem to help and might even have made things a little worse.

The scientists also checked if the medicine affected other things, like cancer spreading to other parts of the body or how long the women lived, and they didn't find any big differences there either.

In the end, they said that while Treatment A might help some women, they need to do more studies to be sure."

It is uncertain whether treatment A provides additional benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. This trial was initiated to explore this question.
Patients and methods:
Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization. The two end points of interest for this study were time to treatment failure (TTF) and survival time.
Results:
Median survival was 30.0 months for chemotherapy alone and 29.3 months treatment A and chemotherapy, p=0.834. Time to treatment failure (TTF) was 13.4 months for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with 10.3 month for chemotherapy alone patients (P = .087). The response rates (complete response and partial response) was 69.2% of for patients who received chemotherapy alone and 68.9% for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy, P =.99. There was no significant difference in toxicities seen between the two arms of the study. There were four lethal toxicities. Three infectious deaths occurred in patients receiving treatment A with chemotherapy.

It is uncertain whether treatment A provides additional benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. This trial was initiated to explore this question.
Patients and methods:
Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with estrogen receptor (ER)‐positive or ER‐unknown metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization.
Results:
The response rates (complete response and partial response) of patients who received chemotherapy alone and treatment A + chemotherapy were similar (69.2% v 68.9%, respectively; P =.99). Time to treatment failure (TTF) was slightly longer for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone patients (13.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.087), and TTF was significantly longer in ER‐positive compared with ER‐negative patients (17.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.048). However, ER status had no effect on overall survival (30.0 months for chemotherapy alone v 29.3 months for treatment A + chemotherapy).
Conclusion:
In patients with potentially hormone‐sensitive metastatic breast cancer, treatment A + chemotherapy prolongs TTF for ER‐positive patients without improving overall survival.",spin,"Sure! Here's a simpler version of the passage for your fifth grader:

Scientists wanted to find out if adding a new treatment, called Treatment A, to regular cancer medicine (chemotherapy) would help people with a certain type of breast cancer. They studied 231 people with this cancer from 1988 to 1992. Some people got just the regular cancer medicine, and others got both the regular medicine and Treatment A.

They found that both groups had about the same number of people whose cancer got smaller or went away for a while. However, the people who got both treatments stayed better for a little longer before their cancer came back. This was especially true for people whose cancer might be affected by hormones. But, in the end, both groups lived about the same amount of time.

So, adding Treatment A helped people stay better a bit longer, but it didn't help them live longer overall."

Efficacy and safety of treatment A was compared with comparator B in a group of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, without previous systemic therapy for advanced breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
The study was a prospective double‐blind randomized trial. All treated patients presented with positive estrogen receptors. Main end points were response rates, toxicity profile analysis, time to progression and survival. WHO and ECOG criteria were employed for response evaluation while toxicity was assessed according to WHO guidelines. Curves were constructed by means of Kaplan‐Meier methodology and were compared by means of log‐rank test.
Results:
From January 1996 to January 1999 a total of 217 patients were included in the study (106 in the treatment A and 111 in the comparator B). Both groups of patients were homogeneous regarding the main prognostic factors. A response rate of 64% (68/106) was observed in the treatment A group as compared with a 52% (58/111) in the comparator B group. Median times to progression and overall survival were not significantly different. A lower incidence of undesirable effects was appreciated in the treatment A arm.

The present study failed to demonstrate a significant difference in DFS or OS between the two treatment groups. However, our study has shown clearly that treatment A can be safely incorporated to dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy.",spin,"Sure! This passage is about a study that looked at how well two different treatments worked for people with a certain type of breast cancer. The researchers wanted to see if adding a special treatment, called ""treatment A,"" to a series of cancer-fighting drugs would help people live longer without the cancer coming back, and also if it would help them live longer overall.

They tested this on 604 people with breast cancer from 1997 to 2000. They split them into two groups: one group got the special treatment A along with other drugs, and the other group got just the other drugs. They checked on the patients for about 5 years to see how they were doing.

In the end, both groups had similar results. About 80% of the people in the first group and 77% in the second group were cancer-free after 3 years. Also, 93% of the first group and 90% of the second group were still alive. The study found that the special treatment A didn't make a big difference in how long people lived without cancer or overall. But, it was safe to use and didn't cause any serious side effects.

So, the study showed that while treatment A was safe, it didn't really help people live longer or stay cancer-free longer compared to the other treatment."
51,16314619,Phase III study of efaproxiral as an adjunct to whole-brain radiation therapy for brain metastases,J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
To determine whether treatment A, improves survival in patients with brain metastases when used as an adjunct to whole‐brain radiation therapy (WBRT).
Patients and methods:
Patients with brain metastases from solid tumors and a Karnofsky performance score of > or = 70 were randomly assigned to receive WBRT with supplemental oxygen and either treatment A (treatment A arm) or no treatment (control arm). The primary end point was survival.
Results:
The study consisted of 515 eligible patients (treatment A arm, n = 265; control arm, n = 250). The median survival time (MST) was 5.4 months for the treatment A arm versus 4.4 months for the control arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87; P = .16). For the subgroup of patients with non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or breast cancer, the MST was 6.0 and 4.4 months, respectively (HR = 0.82; P = .07). Cox multiple regression analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of death for the treatment A arm in both primary populations. Further analysis indicated that the benefit may be restricted to the subgroup of patients with breast cancer. Response rates (radiographic complete response plus partial response) improved by 7% (P = .10) and 13% (P = .01) for all patients and for NSCLC and breast cancer patients in the treatment A arm, respectively. The most common severe adverse event in patients treated with treatment A was hypoxemia, which was reversible and effectively managed with supplemental oxygen in most patients.
Conclusion:
The addition of treatment A to WBRT may improve response rates and survival in patients with brain metastases, particularly metastases from breast cancer. A confirmatory trial for breast cancer patients has been initiated.",spin,"Sure! Here's a simpler version for your fifth grader:

This passage is about a study that wanted to find out if a new treatment, called treatment A, could help people with brain cancer live longer when used with another treatment called whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT).

Here's what they did:

- They had two groups of people with brain cancer. One group got WBRT with treatment A, and the other group just got WBRT.
- They wanted to see which group lived longer.

Here's what they found:

- They had 515 people in the study. The group with treatment A lived about 5.4 months, while the other group lived about 4.4 months.
- For people with certain types of cancer, like lung or breast cancer, the treatment seemed to help more, especially for breast cancer.
- The treatment also helped shrink the cancer a little more in some people.
- Some people had a side effect called hypoxemia, which means they had trouble getting enough oxygen, but they could fix it with extra oxygen.

In conclusion, adding treatment A might help people with brain cancer, especially those with breast cancer, live a bit longer. They're doing more tests to be sure it works well for breast cancer patients."

This passage is about a study where doctors wanted to see if adding a new treatment, called ""treatment A,"" could help people with brain cancer live longer when they also received a type of radiation treatment called WBRT. They had two groups of patients: one group got the new treatment with the radiation, and the other group just got the radiation.

They found that people who got the new treatment lived about one month longer on average than those who didn't, but this difference wasn't big enough to be sure it was because of the new treatment. Also, both groups had similar results in terms of how well the cancer responded to the treatment and how their quality of life was after six months.

In the end, the new treatment didn't really make a big difference, and some people who got it had trouble with their breathing. So, the doctors concluded that adding the new treatment didn't help more than just using the radiation treatment alone."

To compare treatment A and comparator B in node‐positive, operable breast cancer patients.
Methods and materials:
This was a randomized, multicenter, phase III trial enrolling 638 eligible women with prior breast surgery and positive axillary dissection. Patients in Arm A received treatment A, with concomitant radiotherapy (50 Gy +/‐ 10‐20‐Gy boost). Patients in Arm B received comparator B, with subsequent radiotherapy.
Results:
Median treatment durations were 64 and 126 days (Arms A and B, respectively), with no significant difference in overall or disease‐free survival. Five‐year locoregional relapse‐free survival favored patients with conservative surgery (two thirds of the population), with less local and / or regional recurrence in Arm A than in Arm B (3% vs. 9%; p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis in this subgroup showed a 2.8‐fold increased risk of locoregional recurrence with comparator B, independent of other prognostic factors (p = 0.027). Febrile neutropenia and Grade 3‐4 leukopenia were significantly more frequent in Arm A. Subclinical left ventricular ejection fraction events at 1 year were more frequent with treatment A (p = 0.02).

Patients and methods:
Between March 1991 and June 1999, 1863 women with stages I‐IIIA operable breast cancer who had undergone surgery and completed six cycles of adjuvant combination chemotherapy with either CMF, CAF, CEF, FAC or FEC were randomized to receive either treatment A for 3 years or no further treatment. Irrespective of menstrual status and hormone receptor content of the primary tumor, patients were stratified by institute, chemotherapy scheme and age (above 50 years or younger). The main end‐point was to detect a 5% increase in the 5 year survival (from 80% to 85%) in favor of treatment A. Secondary end‐ points were relapse free survival (RFS), local control, incidence of second primary breast cancer.
Results:
After exclusion of all patients from three sites because of inadequate documentation, a total of 1724 patients (93%) were analyzed (Treatment A 861 and Control 863). At a median follow‐up of 6.5 years, 396 deaths (23%) and 602 RFS events (35%) (relapse and/or death) have been observed.

To assess whether the use of intervention A as an adjunct to colposcopy increases the detection of biopsy confirmed CIN 2, 3 (high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia).
Methods:
This is a multicenter two‐arm randomized trial comparing colposcopy alone with colposcopy plus intervention A. Patients were recruited from 13 colposcopy clinics in a variety of practice settings. 2299 women referred for the evaluation of an abnormal cervical cytology were randomized with stratification by cytology; subsequently 113 women were excluded for a variety of reasons. The main study outcomes were differences in true‐positive rates (CIN 2, 3 and cancer identified) and false‐positive rates between the study arms.
Results:
The true‐positive (TP) rates were 14.4% vs. 11.4% (p=0.035, one‐sided) for the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm compared to colposcopy‐only arm, respectively, in women with either an atypical squamous cell (ASC) or low‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) cytology result. TP rates were similar between the two arms among women referred for the evaluation of HSIL (high‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). The 26.5% gain in true‐positives observed with the use of intervention A and colposcopy among women referred for an ASC or LSIL cytology was achieved with only a fractional increase in number of biopsies obtained per patient (0.30) and a modest increase in false‐positive rate
(4%). In the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm among women with ASC or LSIL, the PPV (positive predictive value) of biopsies indicated by ntervention A was 15.0% and the PPV of biopsies indicated by colposcopy was 15.2%. Joint hypothesis testing indicates that intervention A and colposcopy provides benefit compared to colposcopy alone among women with ASC or LSIL.

Nevertheless, in the node‐positive subgroup, the 5‐year LRFS was statistically better in the treatment A arm (97% in treatment A v 91% in comparator B; P = .02), corresponding to a risk of locoregional recurrence decreased by 39% (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.93).
Conclusion:
This treatment protocol remains an appealing clinical option for many women with operable breast cancer at a high risk of recurrence. Combination treatments with new drugs for breast cancer are warranted.",spin,"Sure! Here's a simpler version of the passage for your fifth grader:

In 1996, doctors started a big study to see which of two treatments worked better for women who had a certain type of breast cancer and had surgery to remove it. They wanted to know if one treatment helped people stay free of cancer longer than the other. They checked on the patients for about five years.

They found that, overall, both treatments worked about the same. About 80 out of 100 people in both groups stayed free of cancer for five years. The chance of the cancer coming back in the same area or spreading to other parts of the body was also similar for both treatments.

However, for a specific group of patients who had cancer in their lymph nodes, one treatment (treatment A) was better at stopping the cancer from coming back in the same area. This means that treatment A might be a good choice for some women who have a higher chance of the cancer coming back.

The doctors think that trying new combinations of treatments could be helpful for treating breast cancer in the future."

In 1996, we initiated the multicenter phase III randomized trial to compare the effect on disease‐free survival (DFS) of experimental treatment A versus comparator B after breast‐conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer. This report presents the clinical results with a median follow‐up of 60 months.
Patients and methods:
Between February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial (358 randomized to comparator B and 358 to treatment A) and respectively 343 and 352 patients were included in the analysis. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery. The primary endpoint was disease‐free survival (DFS) defined as the time from randomization to the first treatment failure (in the ipsilateral breast, in the axillary/infraclavicular/IMCs, or at a distant site) or death (if no recurrence had been noted).
Results:
There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5‐year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis‐free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76).

Treatment A is effective against HER‐2‐positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy of treatment A in HER‐2‐negative and HER‐2‐uncharacterized MBC.
Patients and methods:
Women with MBC were randomly assigned to first‐line therapy with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks plus treatment A or placebo. A preplanned retrospective evaluation of HER‐2 status was performed using fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP); secondary end points were objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), event‐free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS).
Results:
In the intent‐to‐treat population (n = 579), there were no significant differences in TTP, EFS, or OS between treatment arms, although differences in ORR and CBR were noted. In 86 HER‐2‐positive patients (15%), treatment with paclitaxel‐ treatment A resulted in statistically significant improvements in TTP, EFS, ORR, and CBR compared with paclitaxel‐placebo.

Many cancer patients continue to smoke postdiagnosis, yet there have been few smoking cessation trials for this population. Depression, which is prevalent among cancer patients, may be a barrier to cessation.
Methods:
This double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial randomized 246 cancer patients to 9 weeks of placebo or treatment A, stratifying by pre‐treatment depression symptoms. In addition, all patients received transdermal nicotine and behavioral counseling. Primary outcomes were 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence, biochemically confirmed, at the end of treatment (Week 12), and at 6 months post quit day (Week 27).

We aimed to compare overall survival in patients receiving treatment A or comparator B.
Methods:
This was an open‐label randomized trial undertaken in 50 centres across eight countries. 1006 treatment‐naive patients diagnosed with advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma were randomly allocated (1 to 1) by minimization to receive comparator B or treatment A. Treatment was not masked. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Treatment groups were compared with a non‐stratified log‐ rank test. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN XXXX.
Findings:
502 patients were randomly assigned to receive comparator B and 504 to receive combined treatment A. Median follow‐up was 37.2 months (24.8‐52.3). Median overall survival was 18.8 months (17.0‐23.2) for patients receiving comparator B versus 18.6 months (16.5‐20.6) for those receiving treatment A. Overall survival did not differ between the two groups (hazard ratio 1.05 [95% CI 0.90‐1.21], p=0.55; absolute difference 0.3% (‐5.1 to 5.6) at 1 year and 2.7% (‐8.2 to 2.9) at 3 years).

Although treatment A does not improve overall or progression‐free survival compared with comparator B, treatment A might still have a role because it can produce remissions that are of clinically relevant length in some patients. Identification of patients who will benefit from treatment A is crucial.",spin,"Sure!

A preplanned subgroup analysis showed that 75 patients with platinum‐refractory or primary platinum‐resistant OC had a median PFS of 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD versus 2.9 months for PLD (hazards ratio, 0.55; P = 0.0425). Hematologic adverse events were 66% on the treatment A + PLD arm versus 44% on the PLD arm, manageable with dose reductions. Nonhematologic adverse events were similar for both arms. The incidence of palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis was lower on treatment A + PLD (23%, 31%, respectively) versus (39%, 49%, respectively) on PLD.
Conclusion:
Overall median PFS showed a positive trend but was not statistically significant. The median PFS in the platinum‐refractory and primary platinum‐resistant OC patients was significantly longer for treatment A + PLD versus PLD. Treatment A may ameliorate the palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis known to be associated with PLD.

Here's a simpler version of the passage for your fifth grader:

The goal of this study was to see if a new treatment, called Treatment A, works well and is safe when used with another medicine called PLD for people with a type of cancer that doesn't respond well to regular treatments. 

In the study, some people got both Treatment A and PLD, while others just got PLD. They got these medicines every 28 days until their cancer got worse or the side effects were too bad. The main thing the researchers wanted to know was how long the people stayed healthy without the cancer getting worse.

The study was supposed to have 244 people, but it stopped early after 125 people because of another study. So, they used the results they had to make their conclusions.

They found that people who got both treatments stayed healthy a little longer than those who just got PLD, but it wasn't a big enough difference to be sure it wasn't just by chance. However, in a special group of people whose cancer was really hard to treat, the combination of treatments did help them stay healthy longer.

Some people had side effects like blood problems, but these could be managed by giving them less medicine. Other side effects were about the same for both groups, but some skin and mouth problems were less common in the group that got both treatments.

In conclusion, the combination of treatments showed some promise, especially for people with very hard-to-treat cancer, and it might help with some side effects. More research is planned to learn more about how well this treatment works."

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment A in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer (OC).
Methods:
Patients with platinum‐refractory or ‐resistant primary or secondary) OC were randomized to receive treatment A and PLD at 50 mg/m2 intravenously or PLD alone at 50 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 every 28 days until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression‐free survival (PFS). Other end points were objective response rate, and safety. The study was originally planned for 244 patients. The trial was temporarily placed on hold after 125 patients were randomized while the results of another trial were being reviewed and the sponsor decided not to resume enrollment. The interim analysis became the final analysis.
Results:
The median PFS was 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD (n = 65) versus 3.7 months for PLD (n = 60) (hazards ratio, 0.92; P = 0.7243). ORR was 12.3% for treatment A + PLD vs. 8.3% for PLD, p=0.5640. Hematologic adverse events were 66% on the treatment A + PLD arm versus 44% on the PLD arm with neutropenia 40.0% vs. 22.8%; thrombopenia 33.8% vs. 7.0%; febrile neutropenia10.8% vs. 3.5%. Nonhematologic adverse events were similar for both arms. The incidence of palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis was lower on treatment A + PLD (23%, 31%, respectively) versus (39%, 49%, respectively) on PLD. The incidence of nausea and fatigue was higher in treatment A + PLD 60.0% vs. 49.1% and 43.1% vs. 36.8%).Thirteen deaths caused by serious adverse event were reported 7 with treatment A + PLD vs. 6 with PLD.

This phase III trial assesses whether treatment A increases the duration of functional independence after surgery or radiosurgery of brain metastases.
Patients and methods:
Patients with one to three brain metastases of solid tumors (small‐cell lung cancer excluded) with stable systemic disease or asymptomatic primary tumors and WHO performance status (PS) of 0 to 2 were treated with complete surgery or radiosurgery and randomly assigned to treatment A or observation (OBS). The primary end point was time to WHO PS deterioration to more than 2.
Results:
Of 359 patients, 199 underwent radiosurgery, and 160 underwent surgery. In the radiosurgery group, 100 patients were allocated to OBS, and 99 were allocated to treatment A. After surgery, 79 patients were allocated to OBS, and 81 were allocated to treatment A. The median time to WHO PS more than 2 was 10.0 months (95% CI, 8.1 to 11.7 months) after OBS and 9.5 months (95% CI, 7.8 to 11.9 months) after treatment A (P = .71). Overall survival was similar in the treatment A and OBS arms (median, 10.9 v 10.7 months, respectively; P = .89). Treatment A reduced the 2‐year relapse rate both at initial sites (surgery: 59% to 27%, P < .001; radiosurgery: 31% to 19%, P = .040) and at new sites (surgery: 42% to 23%, P = .008; radiosurgery: 48% to 33%, P = .023). Salvage therapies were used more frequently after OBS than after treatment A. Intracranial progression caused death in 78 (44%) of 179 patients in the OBS arm and in 50 (28%) of 180 patients in the treatment A arm.

We examined the value of treatment A in a phase III trial with strict preoperative staging and surgical resection guidelines.
Patients and methods:
Patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagogastric junction (AEG II and III) were randomly assigned to treatment A followed by surgery or to surgery alone. To detect with 80% power an improvement in median survival from 17 months with surgery alone to 24 months with treatment A, 282 events were required.
Results:
This trial was stopped for poor accrual after 144 patients were randomly assigned (72:72); 52.8% patients had tumors located in the proximal third of the stomach, including AEG type II and III. The International Union against Cancer R0 resection rate was 81.9% after treatment A as compared with 66.7% with surgery alone (P = .036). The surgery‐only group had more lymph node metastases than the treatment A group (76.5% v 61.4%; P = .018).

Conclusion:
This trial showed a significantly increased R0 resection rate but failed to demonstrate a survival benefit. Possible explanations are low statistical power, a high rate of proximal gastric cancer including AEG and/or a better outcome than expected after radical surgery alone due to the high quality of surgery with resections of regional lymph nodes outside the perigastic area (celiac trunc, hepatic ligament, lymph node at a. lienalis; D2).",spin,"Sure!

They found that both groups of men lived about the same amount of time. The men who got Treatment A lived about 18 months, and the men who didn't get it lived about 17.8 months. So, Treatment A didn't really help them live longer overall.

However, in a small group of men who were very sick, Treatment A seemed to help them live a little longer. But, Treatment A also caused some more serious side effects, like heart problems and blood issues.

In the end, Treatment A didn't make a big difference for most men, but it might help those who are very sick."

Treatment A, has activity alone and in combination with docetaxel (Taxotere) and prednisone (DP) in metastatic castration‐resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). A randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled phase II trial compared DP combined with either treatment A (A) or placebo in chemonaive mCRPC.
Patients and methods:
Men with progressive mCRPC despite androgen deprivation were eligible and randomized 1:1. Patients received docetaxel (75 mg/m2 day 1) and prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily every 21 days with either treatment A or placebo twice daily orally on days 1‐3. The primary end point was overall survival (OS).
Results:
Two hundred and twenty‐one patients were randomly assigned. Median OS for treatment A plus docetaxel‐prednisone (ADP) and placebo‐DP was 18.1 versus 17.8 months [hazard ratio (HR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.72‐1.55, P=0.63]. Secondary end points were also not statistically different. Grade 3/4 toxic effects for ADP versus placebo‐DP were cardiac events (5% versus 2%), lymphopenia (23% versus 16%), neutropenia (47% versus 40%), ileus (2% versus 0%) and pulmonary embolism (6% versus 2%). In a subgroup of high‐risk mCRPC (n=34), outcomes appeared to favor ADP (median OS 19 versus 14 months).
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than placebo in metastatic castration‐ resistant prostate cancer patients.",no_spin,"Sure! Here's a simpler version for your fifth grader:

Scientists wanted to see if a new treatment, called Treatment A, could help men with a type of prostate cancer that doesn't respond to regular treatments. They gave some men Treatment A along with two other medicines, and other men got the same two medicines but with a fake pill instead of Treatment A. They wanted to see if the men who got Treatment A lived longer.

They found that the men who got Treatment A lived about the same amount of time as the men who got the fake pill. Also, both groups had some side effects, like heart problems and low blood cells, but they were mostly similar.

In the end, Treatment A didn't work better than the fake pill for these patients."

A phase III study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) to evaluate the effect on response rate and survival of a treatment A.
Patients and methods:
Four hundred fifty‐six patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B in combination with 5‐FU (500 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) i.v., every 21 days for a maximum of six cycles (eight in case of CR).
Results:
Of 456 patients, 390 were evaluable for efficacy. Objective response (CR + PR) was seen in 57% (treatment A) vs. 41% (comparator B) of the evaluable patients (P = 0.003). The CR rate was higher in the treatment A arm (12% vs. 7%, P = 0.07). Treatment A produced significantly higher response rates in patients with visceral localization (50% vs. 34%, P = 0.011) and in patients with more than two metastatic organ sites (64% vs. 37%, P = 0.001). Median time to progression (7.6 vs. 7 months) and overall survival (18 months vs. 17 months) were similar. Myelosuppression was the principal toxic effect, with grade IV neutropenia observed in 57% of the patients treated with treatment A vs. 9% of those on comparator B. Grade IV infection or febrile neutropenia were observed in 8% (treatment A) vs. 0.4% (comparator B), but the incidence of septic death was the same in the two arms (two patients each). Cardiac toxicity was similar in the two treatment groups, with 5% vs. 3% of the patients taken off study due to cardiac events, primarily due to a decline in LVEF. Only three patients (two in treatment A) experienced congestive heart failure.
Conclusion:
This trial shows that treatment A can be administered for repeated cycles without bone marrow support with increased, though acceptable, toxicity and with a significant increase of antitumor effect (especially in visceral and/or high‐burden disease), but no increased survival.",spin,"Sure!

The purpose of this study was to see how well a new treatment, called treatment A, works for people with a type of advanced breast cancer. They wanted to know if it helped people live longer and if it made the cancer shrink more than another treatment, called comparator B.

Here's what they did: They had 456 people with this cancer, and they split them into two groups. One group got treatment A, and the other group got comparator B. Both groups also got two other medicines. They got these treatments every three weeks, up to six times.

Here's what they found: Out of the people they could measure, 57% of those who got treatment A had their cancer shrink, compared to 41% of those who got comparator B. This means treatment A worked better at shrinking the cancer. It worked especially well for people whose cancer had spread to certain parts of their body or to many places.

However, both treatments didn't really help people live longer. People on treatment A had more side effects, like their blood cells getting really low, which can make them sick. But, the number of people who got very sick or had heart problems was about the same for both treatments.

In conclusion, treatment A helped shrink the cancer more, but it didn't help people live longer. It also had more side effects, but they were manageable."

Results:
Of 456 patients randomized to treatment A (214) or comparator B (242), 390 were evaluable for efficacy (treatment A 182, comparator B 208). There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups for the primary outcome with a median survival of 18 and 17 months, respectively for treatment A and comparator B (P = 0.54). Objective response (CR + PR) was seen in 57% (treatment A) vs. 41% (comparator B) of the evaluable patients (P = 0.003). The median duration of response was 9.1 months on treatment A and 9.3 on comparator B, the median Time to Treatment Failure (TTF) was, respectively, 5.8 vs. 5.3 months (P = 0.7).

They gave these treatments to 456 people and checked how long they lived and how well the treatments worked. They found that both groups lived about the same amount of time, around 18 months for Treatment A and 17 months for Comparator B. So, neither treatment helped people live longer than the other.

However, more people responded positively to Treatment A (57%) compared to Comparator B (41%). But, the time the treatment worked before the cancer got worse was about the same for both groups.

Treatment A had more serious side effects, like making it harder for the body to fight infections. Some people got very sick because of this. Both treatments had similar effects on the heart, but a few people had heart problems.

In the end, Treatment A wasn't better than Comparator B for helping people with this type of cancer."
