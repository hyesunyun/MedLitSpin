Randomized trial of fenretinide to prevent second breast malignancy in women with early breast cancer",J Natl Cancer Inst,"Background:
Treatment A has been shown to inhibit breast carcinogenesis in preclinical studies. We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.
Methods:
We randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30‐70 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66‐1.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64‐1.09; P = .177) between the two arms. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs (38 in the treatment A arm versus 40 in the control arm), incidence of distant metastasis (HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.79‐1.22; P = .858), and all‐cause mortality (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.92‐1.48; P = .215).

Treatment A was not more effective than no treatment in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.",no_spin," Sure, I'd be happy to help you summarize the abstract for your fifth grader!

The study was about a medicine called Treatment A that doctors wanted to see if it could help prevent breast cancer from coming back in women who already had breast cancer. They gave some women Treatment A and some women didn't get it, and they wanted to see if there was a difference in how many women got breast cancer again.

They found that there wasn't a big difference between the two groups. A little less than 100 women in each group got breast cancer again, and it didn't matter if they took Treatment A or not. The medicine didn't seem to help prevent breast cancer from coming back.

The doctors also looked at other things, like if the cancer spread to other parts of the body or if the women died from cancer. They found that there wasn't a big difference between the two groups for these things either.

So, the study showed that Treatment A didn't work very well in preventing breast cancer from coming back in women who already had breast cancer."

The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization.

The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (P =.642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (P =.177) between the two arms. However, an interaction was detected between treatment A and menopausal status in both outcomes (P for interaction in both outcomes =.045), with a possible beneficial effect in premenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66, and 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.41‐1.07; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 0.65, and 95% CI = 0.46‐0. 92) and an opposite effect in postmenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.32, and 95% CI = 0.82‐2.15; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.19, and 95% CI = 0.75‐1. 89). There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs, incidence of distant metastasis, and all‐cause mortality.
Conclusion:
Treatment A of women with breast cancer for 5 years appears to have no statistically significant effect on the incidence of second breast malignancies overall, although a possible benefit was detected in premenopausal women.

The study was about a treatment called Treatment A that was given to women who had breast cancer. The researchers wanted to see if Treatment A could help prevent the cancer from coming back. They gave Treatment A to some women and not to others, and then they watched both groups for 5 years to see if there were any differences in the number of women who got cancer again.

The results showed that Treatment A didn't really help prevent cancer from coming back. There were about the same number of women who got cancer again in both groups. But, the researchers did notice that Treatment A seemed to work a little better for women who had not yet gone through menopause.

The researchers also looked at other things, like whether Treatment A affected the chance of getting cancer in other parts of the body or whether it affected the chance of dying from cancer. They didn't find any big differences between the two groups.

So, overall, the study found that Treatment A didn't really help prevent cancer from coming back, but it might be a little helpful for some women who haven't gone through menopause yet.

It's important to note that the study was published in a scientific journal, which means it was reviewed"

It is uncertain whether treatment A provides additional benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. This trial was initiated to explore this question.
Patients and methods:
Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization. The two end points of interest for this study were time to treatment failure (TTF) and survival time.
Results:
Median survival was 30.0 months for chemotherapy alone and 29.3 months treatment A and chemotherapy, p=0.834. Time to treatment failure (TTF) was 13.4 months for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with 10.3 month for chemotherapy alone patients (P = .087). The response rates (complete response and partial response) was 69.2% of for patients who received chemotherapy alone and 68.9% for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy, P =.99.

The study was done to see if a new treatment called ""treatment A"" would help people with a type of cancer called metastatic breast cancer. The researchers wanted to see if treatment A would work better than the usual treatment, which is chemotherapy.

They had a group of 231 patients who had metastatic breast cancer, and they randomly gave some of them treatment A and chemotherapy, and some of them just chemotherapy. They looked at how well the treatments worked and how long it took for the cancer to come back.

The results showed that treatment A didn't work any better than chemotherapy alone. The patients who got treatment A and chemotherapy lived for about 29.3 months, and the patients who got just chemotherapy lived for about 30.0 months. The response rates (meaning how many patients had their cancer shrink or go away) were almost the same for both groups.

The researchers also looked at how safe the treatments were, and they found that there were some serious side effects in patients who got treatment A and chemotherapy, including four deaths from infection.

Patients and methods:
Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with estrogen receptor (ER)‐positive or ER‐unknown metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization.
Results:
The response rates (complete response and partial response) of patients who received chemotherapy alone and treatment A + chemotherapy were similar (69.2% v 68.9%, respectively; P =.99). Time to treatment failure (TTF) was slightly longer for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone patients (13.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.087), and TTF was significantly longer in ER‐positive compared with ER‐negative patients (17.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.048). However, ER status had no effect on overall survival (30.0 months for chemotherapy alone v 29.3 months for treatment A + chemotherapy).

The study was done to see if a new treatment called ""treatment A"" would help people with a type of cancer called metastatic breast cancer. The researchers wanted to see if treatment A would work better than the usual treatment, which is chemotherapy. They tested both treatments on a group of patients and looked at how well they worked.

The results showed that treatment A didn't work much better than chemotherapy. In fact, the two treatments had pretty similar results. But the researchers did find that treatment A worked a little better for patients who had a certain type of cancer called ER-positive. This means that for those patients, treatment A helped them live a bit longer without their cancer getting worse.

However, it's important to note that the study didn't show that treatment A helped people live longer overall. It only helped some patients live a bit longer without their cancer getting worse. So, the study didn't really show that treatment A is a better treatment than chemotherapy.

It's also important to know that the study had some problems. The researchers were trying to make the study sound more positive than it really was. They did this by focusing on the small benefit that treatment A had for some patients, instead of looking at the bigger"

Efficacy and safety of treatment A was compared with comparator B in a group of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, without previous systemic therapy for advanced breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
The study was a prospective double‐blind randomized trial. All treated patients presented with positive estrogen receptors. Main end points were response rates, toxicity profile analysis, time to progression and survival. WHO and ECOG criteria were employed for response evaluation while toxicity was assessed according to WHO guidelines. Curves were constructed by means of Kaplan‐Meier methodology and were compared by means of log‐rank test.
Results:
From January 1996 to January 1999 a total of 217 patients were included in the study (106 in the treatment A and 111 in the comparator B). Both groups of patients were homogeneous regarding the main prognostic factors. A response rate of 64% (68/106) was observed in the treatment A group as compared with a 52% (58/111) in the comparator B group. Median times to progression and overall survival were not significantly different. A lower incidence of undesirable effects was appreciated in the treatment A arm.
Conclusion:
Our data suggest that treatment A is an efficient and well‐tolerated agent for the therapy of postmenopausal women with hormonal positive receptors advanced breast cancer, and must be considered an alternative to comparator B as first line therapy for ER+ advanced breast cancer patients and as well as an adjuvant treatment.",spin," Sure, I'd be happy to help you summarize the abstract in a way that a fifth grader can understand!

The study was about a new treatment for breast cancer in women who have not had treatment before. The researchers wanted to see if the new treatment was better than an older treatment that is already being used. They looked at how well the treatments worked and how safe they were for the patients.

The study found that the new treatment worked a little better than the older treatment, but not by a lot. The researchers also found that the new treatment had fewer side effects than the older treatment.

However, the study also had some problems. The researchers only looked at a small group of patients, and they only looked at certain things that might not be important to everyone. They also tried to make the new treatment sound better than it really was by focusing on some small benefits that might not be that important.

So, the study suggests that the new treatment might be a good option for some women with breast cancer, but we need to be careful when looking at the results because the study had some limitations and the researchers might have been a little biased in their reporting."

The study was about a new treatment for breast cancer that had spread to other parts of the body. The researchers wanted to see if this new treatment was better than an older treatment that is already being used. They tested both treatments on a group of women who had breast cancer that had gotten worse despite taking the older treatment.

The researchers looked at how long it took for the cancer to grow or spread again after starting the new treatment or the older treatment. They found that the new treatment was not better than the older treatment at stopping the cancer from growing or spreading.

They also looked at how well the treatments worked in terms of how long the women lived, how well the cancer responded to the treatment, and how long the response lasted. They found that the new treatment was a little better than the older treatment when it came to how long the response lasted, but there was no big difference between the two treatments overall.

So, in summary, the study found that the new treatment was not significantly better than the older treatment for advanced breast cancer that had spread to other parts of the body."

The study was done to compare two treatments for advanced breast cancer in patients who had tried other treatments before and their cancer had gotten worse. The researchers wanted to see which treatment worked better and was easier to tolerate.

They found that one treatment, called ""treatment A,"" worked about the same as the other treatment, called ""comparator B."" Both treatments had similar results in terms of how long it took for the cancer to grow again. However, treatment A seemed to work a little better for some patients, and it also had a longer duration of response (meaning the cancer didn't grow back as quickly) for patients who responded to the treatment.

The researchers also looked at how well the treatments were tolerated, and they found that both treatments were well tolerated, meaning they didn't cause too many side effects.

So, in summary, the study found that treatment A and comparator B were both effective in treating advanced breast cancer, but treatment A seemed to work a little better for some patients and had fewer side effects.

It's important to note that the study was well-designed and well-conducted, but it did have some limitations. For example, the study was done on a small group of patients, so"

The study was about a new treatment for breast cancer. The researchers wanted to see if adding a new drug to a common chemotherapy treatment would help shrink tumors more effectively. They tested this new treatment on over 200 patients and looked at how well it worked compared to the standard chemotherapy treatment.

The results showed that the new treatment didn't actually shrink tumors any better than the standard treatment. But, the researchers found something interesting. They looked at a certain type of breast cancer called ""ER-"" and found that the new treatment worked better for those patients. They also found that patients who had high levels of a certain protein called Ki67 in their tumors before treatment had a better chance of having a complete response to the treatment.

So, even though the new treatment didn't work better overall, it did seem to help some patients with a specific type of breast cancer. But, it's important to remember that this study was small, and more research is needed to confirm these findings.

A total of 595 patients were eligible. Median follow‐up was 61.7 months for group A and 62 months for group B. The 3‐year DFS was 80% in group A and 77% in group B. Survival rates were 93% and 90%, respectively. The effect of treatment on the hazard of death was different according to hormonal receptor status. More specifically, in patients with negative receptor status the hazard of death was significantly higher for group B (hazard ratio 2.42). Both regimens were well tolerated and severe acute side‐effects were infrequent. No cases of severe cardiotoxicity or acute leukemia were recorded.
Conclusion:
The present study failed to demonstrate a significant difference in DFS or OS between the two treatment groups. However, our study has shown clearly that treatment A can be safely incorporated to dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy.",spin," Sure, I'd be happy to help you summarize the abstract in a way that a fifth grader can understand!

The study was done to see if a certain treatment for breast cancer worked well. The researchers wanted to see if the treatment could help people live longer without their cancer coming back. They compared two different ways of giving the treatment to see which one worked better.

The study found that the treatment didn't really help people live longer, and the cancer came back about the same amount for both groups. But, the researchers did find that the treatment was safe and didn't cause too many bad side effects.

So, even though the treatment didn't work as well as they had hoped, the researchers still think it's important to keep studying it to see if it might be helpful for some people. But, they need to be careful not to make it sound like the treatment is better than it really is. That's why they're being honest about the results and saying that the study didn't show a big difference between the two groups.

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
51,16314619,Phase III study of efaproxiral as an adjunct to whole-brain radiation therapy for brain metastases,J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
To determine whether treatment A, improves survival in patients with brain metastases when used as an adjunct to whole‐brain radiation therapy (WBRT).
Patients and methods:
Patients with brain metastases from solid tumors and a Karnofsky performance score of > or = 70 were randomly assigned to receive WBRT with supplemental oxygen and either treatment A (treatment A arm) or no treatment (control arm). The primary end point was survival.
Results:
The study consisted of 515 eligible patients (treatment A arm, n = 265; control arm, n = 250). The median survival time (MST) was 5.4 months for the treatment A arm versus 4.4 months for the control arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87; P = .16). For the subgroup of patients with non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or breast cancer, the MST was 6.0 and 4.4 months, respectively (HR = 0.82; P = .07). Cox multiple regression analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of death for the treatment A arm in both primary populations. Further analysis indicated that the benefit may be restricted to the subgroup of patients with breast cancer. Response rates (radiographic complete response plus partial response) improved by 7% (P = .10) and 13% (P = .01) for all patients and for NSCLC and breast cancer patients in the treatment A arm, respectively. The most common severe adverse event in patients treated with treatment A was hypoxemia, which was reversible and effectively managed with supplemental oxygen in most patients.
Conclusion:
The addition of treatment A to WBRT may improve response rates and survival in patients with brain metastases, particularly metastases from breast cancer.

The study was done to see if a new treatment called ""treatment A"" could help people with cancer in their brain. The researchers wanted to see if treatment A could help people live longer when used together with a type of radiation therapy called whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT).

The study included 515 patients who were randomly put into two groups: one group got treatment A and the other group didn't get treatment A. The researchers looked at how long people lived in both groups and found that people who got treatment A lived a little bit longer than people who didn't get it.

But here's the thing: when they looked closer, they found that the treatment A only seemed to really help people with a certain type of cancer called breast cancer. For people with other types of cancer, treatment A didn't seem to make a difference.

The researchers also found that some people who got treatment A had a side effect called hypoxemia, which means their blood didn't have enough oxygen. But they were able to fix this problem by giving them more oxygen.

The study was about a new treatment for people who have cancer in their brain. The treatment was called ""treatment A"" and it was tested to see if it could help people live longer. The researchers took a group of patients with brain cancer and gave some of them treatment A, while the others did not get it. They then compared how long the patients lived and looked at how well the treatment worked.

The results showed that treatment A did not help people live longer than those who did not get the treatment. In fact, the patients who got treatment A had almost the same survival time as those who did not get it. The researchers also looked at how well the treatment worked in terms of shrinking the cancer or making the patients feel better, but they found that it did not work much better than the standard treatment.

The study found that treatment A was not more effective than the standard treatment for brain cancer, so the researchers concluded that it was not a useful treatment. It's important to note that the study was done to help doctors and patients make informed decisions about cancer treatment, and it's always good to have reliable information to base those decisions on."

To compare treatment A and comparator B in node‐positive, operable breast cancer patients.
Methods and materials:
This was a randomized, multicenter, phase III trial enrolling 638 eligible women with prior breast surgery and positive axillary dissection. Patients in Arm A received treatment A, with concomitant radiotherapy (50 Gy +/‐ 10‐20‐Gy boost). Patients in Arm B received comparator B, with subsequent radiotherapy.
Results:
Median treatment durations were 64 and 126 days (Arms A and B, respectively), with no significant difference in overall or disease‐free survival. Five‐year locoregional relapse‐free survival favored patients with conservative surgery (two thirds of the population), with less local and / or regional recurrence in Arm A than in Arm B (3% vs. 9%; p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis in this subgroup showed a 2.8‐fold increased risk of locoregional recurrence with comparator B, independent of other prognostic factors (p = 0.027). Febrile neutropenia and Grade 3‐4 leukopenia were significantly more frequent in Arm A. Subclinical left ventricular ejection fraction events at 1 year were more frequent with treatment A (p = 0.02).

The study was done to compare two different treatments for breast cancer. The researchers wanted to see which treatment worked better and had fewer side effects. They looked at two groups of patients: those who had surgery to remove the cancer and those who didn't have surgery.

The results showed that one of the treatments (called ""treatment A"") worked better for patients who had surgery. It also had fewer side effects than the other treatment (called ""comparator B""). However, the researchers found that treatment A had more side effects for patients who didn't have surgery.

The researchers also looked at how well the treatments worked for patients who had a certain type of breast cancer called ""node-positive"" breast cancer. They found that treatment A worked better for these patients than comparator B.

So, in summary, the study found that treatment A worked better for patients who had surgery and node-positive breast cancer, but it had more side effects for patients who didn't have surgery.

The study was about a new treatment for breast cancer. The researchers wanted to see if this treatment was better than the usual treatment. They tested it on a group of women who had breast cancer that had spread to their lymph nodes and were able to have surgery.

The researchers divided the women into two groups. One group got the new treatment, and the other group got the usual treatment. They looked at how well the treatments worked after five years.

The results showed that the new treatment was not better than the usual treatment. In fact, the usual treatment worked a little bit better in some ways. For example, fewer women who got the usual treatment had cancer come back in their breasts.

The researchers also looked at some other things, like how long the treatments took and how many women had side effects. They found that the new treatment had more side effects, like low white blood cell counts and heart problems.

So, in summary, the study found that the new treatment was not better than the usual treatment for breast cancer, and it had more side effects."

The study was done to see if a certain treatment (called ""treatment A"") helps people with breast cancer live longer or prevents the cancer from coming back. The researchers looked at a group of 1863 women who had breast cancer and had already finished six months of chemotherapy. They were split into two groups: one group got treatment A for three years, and the other group didn't get any further treatment.

The researchers found that treatment A didn't really help people live longer overall. But, it did help some people who had a certain type of breast cancer (called ""node-positive"" cancer) or who had cancer cells that had certain proteins (called ""ER and PR positive"" cancer).

The researchers also found that treatment A didn't prevent the cancer from coming back in most people. But, it did help some people who had node-positive cancer or ER and PR positive cancer.

So, the study found that treatment A doesn't work very well for everyone with breast cancer, but it might help some people with certain types of cancer.

It's important to note that the study had some problems, so the results might not be totally accurate. Also, the researchers might have tried to make the results sound better than they"

To assess whether the use of intervention A as an adjunct to colposcopy increases the detection of biopsy confirmed CIN 2, 3 (high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia).
Methods:
This is a multicenter two‐arm randomized trial comparing colposcopy alone with colposcopy plus intervention A. Patients were recruited from 13 colposcopy clinics in a variety of practice settings. 2299 women referred for the evaluation of an abnormal cervical cytology were randomized with stratification by cytology; subsequently 113 women were excluded for a variety of reasons. The main study outcomes were differences in true‐positive rates (CIN 2, 3 and cancer identified) and false‐positive rates between the study arms.
Results:
The true‐positive (TP) rates were 14.4% vs. 11.4% (p=0.035, one‐sided) for the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm compared to colposcopy‐only arm, respectively, in women with either an atypical squamous cell (ASC) or low‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) cytology result. TP rates were similar between the two arms among women referred for the evaluation of HSIL (high‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). The 26.5% gain in true‐positives observed with the use of intervention A and colposcopy among women referred for an ASC or LSIL cytology was achieved with only a fractional increase in number of biopsies obtained per patient (0.30) and a modest increase in false‐positive rate
(4%). In the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm among women with ASC or LSIL, the PPV (positive predictive value) of biopsies indicated by ntervention A was 15.0% and the PPV of biopsies indicated by colposcopy was 15.2%. Joint hypothesis testing indicates that intervention A and colposcopy provides benefit compared to colposcopy alone among women with ASC or LSIL.

There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5‐year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis‐free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76). Nevertheless, in the node‐positive subgroup, the 5‐year LRFS was statistically better in the treatment A arm (97% in treatment A v 91% in comparator B; P = .02), corresponding to a risk of locoregional recurrence decreased by 39% (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.93).
Conclusion:
This treatment protocol remains an appealing clinical option for many women with operable breast cancer at a high risk of recurrence. Combination treatments with new drugs for breast cancer are warranted.",spin," Sure, I'd be happy to help you summarize the abstract in a way that a fifth grader can understand!

The study was done to compare two different treatments for breast cancer. The researchers wanted to see which treatment was better at keeping the cancer from coming back. They looked at two groups of patients: one group got the new treatment, and the other group got the standard treatment.

The researchers found that the new treatment was not better than the standard treatment at keeping the cancer from coming back. In fact, the two treatments were almost the same in terms of how well they worked.

But, the researchers did find something interesting. They looked at a smaller group of patients who had cancer that had spread to their lymph nodes. In this group, the new treatment was better at keeping the cancer from coming back than the standard treatment.

So, the study found that the new treatment was not better overall, but it might be helpful for some patients with cancer that has spread to their lymph nodes.

It's important to note that the study had a spin. This means that the researchers tried to make the new treatment sound better than it actually was. They did this by focusing on the positive results they found in the smaller group of patients, even though the overall results were not that different.

It's always important to look carefully at the results of a study and not just"
54,17264336,Phase III trial of concurrent or sequential adjuvant chemoradiotherapy after conservative surgery for early-stage breast cancer: final results of the ARCOSEIN trial,J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
In 1996, we initiated the multicenter phase III randomized trial to compare the effect on disease‐free survival (DFS) of experimental treatment A versus comparator B after breast‐conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer. This report presents the clinical results with a median follow‐up of 60 months.
Patients and methods:
Between February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial (358 randomized to comparator B and 358 to treatment A) and respectively 343 and 352 patients were included in the analysis. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery. The primary endpoint was disease‐free survival (DFS) defined as the time from randomization to the first treatment failure (in the ipsilateral breast, in the axillary/infraclavicular/IMCs, or at a distant site) or death (if no recurrence had been noted).
Results:
There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5‐year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis‐free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76).

The study found that the new treatment didn't work better than the usual treatment. Both groups had similar results when it came to how long they lived without their cancer coming back. The researchers also looked at other things, like how well the treatment worked in specific areas of the body, and they found that the new treatment wasn't better than the usual treatment in any of those areas either.

The study was about a treatment for breast cancer. The researchers wanted to see if the treatment was effective in the long term, so they followed a group of patients for 12 years. They found that the treatment helped some patients, but not all of them.

The researchers divided the patients into two groups: those with fast-growing tumors and those with slower-growing tumors. They found that the treatment was most effective for patients with intermediate-growing tumors. In fact, it reduced the chance of the cancer coming back or the patient dying from cancer by 70-80%!

However, the researchers also found that the treatment didn't work as well for patients with fast-growing tumors. They also noticed that some patients didn't receive the full dose of the treatment, and those patients didn't benefit as much from it.

So, the study found that the treatment was effective for some patients with breast cancer, but not for all of them. It's important to remember that this study was done a long time ago, and cancer treatments have probably improved a lot since then.

The study was about a new treatment for a type of cancer called metastatic breast cancer. The researchers wanted to see if this new treatment was better than an existing treatment. They tested the two treatments on a group of patients and looked at how well they worked and how safe they were.

The new treatment was better than the existing treatment in some ways. For example, it helped shrink the tumors more and made the patients feel better. But, it didn't help the patients live longer. The researchers also found that the new treatment had some side effects, but they weren't too bad.

So, the study found that the new treatment is a good option for some patients, but it's not perfect. It's important to remember that this study only looked at a small group of patients, so more research is needed to confirm the results.

Treatment A is effective against HER‐2‐positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy of treatment A in HER‐2‐negative and HER‐2‐uncharacterized MBC.
Patients and methods:
Women with MBC were randomly assigned to first‐line therapy with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks plus treatment A or placebo. A preplanned retrospective evaluation of HER‐2 status was performed using fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP); secondary end points were objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), event‐free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS).
Results:
In the intent‐to‐treat population (n = 579), there were no significant differences in TTP, EFS, or OS between treatment arms, although differences in ORR and CBR were noted. In 86 HER‐2‐positive patients (15%), treatment with paclitaxel‐ treatment A resulted in statistically significant improvements in TTP, EFS, ORR, and CBR compared with paclitaxel‐placebo. No differences between treatment groups were observed for any end point in HER‐2‐negative patients. The most common adverse events were alopecia, rash, and diarrhea. The incidence of diarrhea and rash was significantly higher in the paclitaxel‐treatment A arm. The rate of cardiac events was low, and no difference was observed between treatment arms.

The treatment was a pill that they took for 9 weeks, and it was supposed to help them stop smoking. The researchers also gave all the patients some nicotine patches and counseling to help them quit smoking. They checked to see how many patients had stopped smoking after 12 weeks and again after 27 weeks.

Unfortunately, the treatment didn't work very well. The number of patients who stopped smoking was almost the same for both the treatment and placebo groups.

Many cancer patients continue to smoke postdiagnosis, yet there have been few smoking cessation trials for this population. Depression, which is prevalent among cancer patients, may be a barrier to cessation.
Methods:
This double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial randomized 246 cancer patients to 9 weeks of placebo or treatment A, stratifying by pre‐treatment depression symptoms. In addition, all patients received transdermal nicotine and behavioral counseling. Primary outcomes were 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence, biochemically confirmed, at the end of treatment (Week 12), and at 6 months post quit day (Week 27).

Results:
There was no main effect of treatment A vs. placebo on abstinence (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.38‐4.81, p = 0.64). Patients with depression symptoms reported significantly lower abstinence rates vs. patients without depression symptoms (OR = .14, 95% CI: 0.02‐0.80, p=0.03). Treatment A increased abstinence rates, vs. placebo, more for participants with depression vs. those without depression symptoms.

For patients with depression symptoms, treatment increases abstinence rates, lowers withdrawal, and increases quality of life. However, abstinence rates among patients with depression symptoms were low vs. patients without depression symptoms, who exhibited similar abstinence rates when treated with treatment A or transdermal nicotine and counseling alone. These results can guide future smoking cessation intervention studies with cancer patients.",spin," Sure, I'd be happy to help you summarize the abstract in a way that your fifth grader can understand!

The study was about a new treatment to help cancer patients quit smoking. The researchers wanted to see if the treatment worked, so they tested it on a group of cancer patients who smoked. They compared the treatment to a fake treatment (called a ""placebo"") to see if the real treatment was better.

The researchers found that the treatment didn't work very well for all the patients. But, they noticed that it did work a little better for patients who were also feeling sad or depressed. For these patients, the treatment helped them quit smoking a bit more, and it also made them feel better and have fewer withdrawal symptoms.

The researchers thought this was interesting, so they wrote a report about their findings. But, they also tried to make the treatment sound better than it really was by focusing on the positive things they found. This is called ""spin"" and it's not a very honest way to report the results of a study.

So, in summary, the study found that the treatment didn't work very well for all cancer patients who smoked, but it did work a little better for patients who were also feeling sad or depressed.

The researchers found that the new treatment did not help patients live longer than the current treatment. In fact, the two treatments had very similar results. However, the researchers did find that some patients who received the new treatment had their cancer go away for a little while, which could be helpful.

They looked at how long the patients lived and how well the treatment worked.

The researchers found that the new treatment didn't work better than the usual treatment.

An assessment was performed at baseline, weekly during radiotherapy, and for 2 weeks after radiotherapy.
Results:
A total of 176 patients were enrolled between September 21, 2007, and December 7, 2007. The provider assessed primary endpoint showed no difference in the mean maximum grade of radiation dermatitis by treatment arm (1.2 for treatment A vs. 1.3 for placebo; p = .18). Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events toxicity was greater in the placebo group (p = .04), primarily from pruritus. For the patient‐reported outcome measures, the maximum Skindex‐16 score for the treatment A group showed less itching (p = .008), less irritation (p = .01), less symptom persistence or recurrence (p = .02), and less annoyance with skin problems (p = .04). The group’s maximal Skin Toxicity Assessment Tool score showed less burning sensation (p = .02) and less itching (p = .002).
Conclusion:
Patients receiving daily treatment A during radiotherapy might experience reduced acute skin toxicity compared with patients receiving placebo.",spin," Sure, I'd be happy to help you summarize the abstract in a way that a fifth grader can understand!

The study was done to see if a special cream called ""treatment A"" could help people who are getting radiation therapy for breast cancer. The researchers wanted to see if the cream could reduce the side effects that people often get from radiation, like redness, itching, and burning.

They had a bunch of people participate in the study, and they randomly gave some people the cream and others a fake cream that didn't have any active ingredients. Then, they watched to see how many people in each group got side effects from the radiation.

The results showed that the people who got the fake cream had a little more side effects than the people who got the real cream. But, the difference wasn't very big, so the researchers couldn't say for sure that the cream really helped.

The researchers also looked at some other things, like how much itching and burning people had, and they found that the people who got the real cream had less of those side effects. But, they didn't find a big difference in the number of people who got side effects overall.

So, the study didn't really show that the cream works very well to reduce side effects from radiation therapy. But,"

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment A in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer (OC).
Methods:
Patients with platinum‐refractory or ‐resistant primary or secondary) OC were randomized to receive treatment A and PLD at 50 mg/m2 intravenously or PLD alone at 50 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 every 28 days until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression‐free survival (PFS). Other end points were objective response rate and safety. The study was originally planned for 244 patients. The trial was temporarily placed on hold after 125 patients were randomized while the results of another trial were being reviewed and the sponsor decided not to resume enrollment. The interim analysis became the final analysis.
Results:
The median PFS was 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD (n = 65) versus 3.7 months for PLD (n = 60) (hazards ratio, 0.92; P = 0.7243). A preplanned subgroup analysis showed that 75 patients with platinum‐refractory or primary platinum‐resistant OC had a median PFS of 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD versus 2.9 months for PLD (hazards ratio, 0.55; P = 0.0425). Hematologic adverse events were 66% on the treatment A + PLD arm versus 44% on the PLD arm, manageable with dose reductions. Nonhematologic adverse events were similar for both arms. The incidence of palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis was lower on treatment A + PLD (23%, 31%, respectively) versus (39%, 49%, respectively) on PLD.
Conclusion:
Overall median PFS showed a positive trend but was not statistically significant. The median PFS in the platinum‐refractory and primary platinum‐resistant OC patients was significantly longer for treatment A + PLD versus PLD. Treatment A may ameliorate the palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis known to be associated with PLD.

The study was about a new treatment for a type of cancer called ovarian cancer. The researchers wanted to see if the new treatment was safe and effective in combination with another drug called pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD). They tested the treatment on two groups of patients: those who had tried other treatments before and they didn't work (called ""platinum-resistant"" patients), and those who had never tried other treatments (called ""platinum-naive"" patients).

The researchers found that the new treatment plus PLD worked a little better than just PLD alone for patients who had tried other treatments before. However, the difference was not big enough to be considered statistically significant, which means that it could have happened by chance.

The researchers also looked at a smaller group of patients who had a specific type of ovarian cancer called ""platinum-refractory"" or ""primary platinum-resistant"" cancer. For these patients, the new treatment plus PLD worked significantly better than just PLD alone.

The study also found that the new treatment reduced some side effects that are commonly associated with PLD, such as painful sores on the hands and feet.

The study was about a new treatment for a type of cancer called ovarian cancer. The researchers wanted to see if the new treatment was better than the usual treatment. They gave some patients the new treatment and some patients the usual treatment. They looked at how well the treatments worked and how safe they were.

The new treatment didn't work better than the usual treatment. In fact, the usual treatment worked a little bit better. But the new treatment had some good effects too. It made some patients feel better and it didn't make them as sick as the usual treatment did.

So, the researchers decided that the new treatment wasn't better than the usual treatment. But they still learned some important things from the study that can help them make better treatments in the future.

That's it in a nutshell! I hope that helps your fifth grader understand the study."

This phase III trial assesses whether treatment A increases the duration of functional independence after surgery or radiosurgery of brain metastases.
Patients and methods:
Patients with one to three brain metastases of solid tumors (small‐cell lung cancer excluded) with stable systemic disease or asymptomatic primary tumors and WHO performance status (PS) of 0 to 2 were treated with complete surgery or radiosurgery and randomly assigned to treatment A or observation (OBS). The primary end point was time to WHO PS deterioration to more than 2.
Results:
Of 359 patients, 199 underwent radiosurgery, and 160 underwent surgery. In the radiosurgery group, 100 patients were allocated to OBS, and 99 were allocated to treatment A. After surgery, 79 patients were allocated to OBS, and 81 were allocated to treatment A. The median time to WHO PS more than 2 was 10.0 months (95% CI, 8.1 to 11.7 months) after OBS and 9.5 months (95% CI, 7.8 to 11.9 months) after treatment A (P = .71). Overall survival was similar in the treatment A and OBS arms (median, 10.9 v 10.7 months, respectively; P = .89).

The study was done to see if a certain treatment called ""treatment A"" could help people with cancer that had spread to their brain. The researchers wanted to see if treatment A could make people live longer without their cancer getting worse.

They looked at two groups of people: one group got treatment A, and the other group didn't get treatment A (this group was called ""observation""). They found that treatment A didn't really help people live longer overall.

But, they did find that treatment A helped reduce the chance of the cancer coming back in the brain. And, it also helped reduce the chance of people dying from their cancer.

So, the study found that treatment A might be helpful in some ways, but it's not a magic bullet. It's important to remember that this study was done on a specific group of people, and it might not apply to everyone.

Now, the abstract also uses some technical terms and statistics, but the main point is that treatment A didn't really help people live longer, but it did help reduce the chance of cancer coming back in the brain and dying from it."

Patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagogastric junction (AEG II and III) were randomly assigned to treatment A followed by surgery or to surgery alone. To detect with 80% power an improvement in median survival from 17 months with surgery alone to 24 months with treatment A, 282 events were required.
Results:
This trial was stopped for poor accrual after 144 patients were randomly assigned (72:72); 52.8% patients had tumors located in the proximal third of the stomach, including AEG type II and III. The International Union against Cancer R0 resection rate was 81.9% after treatment A as compared with 66.7% with surgery alone (P = .036). The surgery‐only group had more lymph node metastases than the treatment A group (76.5% v 61.4%; P = .018).

The study was about a new treatment for a type of cancer called adenocarcinoma that affects the stomach or the area where the esophagus meets the stomach. The researchers wanted to see if this new treatment would help people live longer than the usual treatment, which is surgery.

They had a group of patients who got the new treatment and a group who just had surgery. They looked at how many patients had their cancer completely removed by surgery and how many had cancer that had spread to their lymph nodes. They also looked at how many patients had complications after surgery.

The researchers found that more patients had their cancer completely removed by surgery if they had the new treatment. But they didn't find that the new treatment helped people live longer overall. They thought this might be because not enough patients were in the study, or because the cancer was more advanced than they thought, or because the surgery was really good at removing the cancer.

So, the study didn't show that the new treatment was better than surgery, but it did show that it might be helpful in some ways. It's important to remember that this study had some limitations, so we need to be careful when interpreting the results."

Patients and methods:
One hundred and ninety‐two breast, gastrointestinal, and haematologic cancer patients were recruited before the trial closing prematurely (original target 352). Treatment A was administered before first treatment (intervention 1), 48 h after first treatment (intervention 2), and immediately before second treatment (intervention 3).

They tested it on a group of people who had cancer and were about to start chemotherapy.

The results showed that the new way didn't really help people feel less stressed, but it did help them feel less worried about some things related to their treatment. It also helped some people feel better about their treatment, but only for a little while.

The researchers thought that the new way might be helpful for some people, but they need to do more research to make sure it really works. They also said that it's important to be careful when reading about studies like this, because sometimes people can make it sound like the study found something important when it really didn't.

At T2 and T3 treatment A did not significantly reduce patients distress with mean (SD) HADS scores respectively for routine care vs. treatment A at T2 10.9 (6.8) vs. 9.9 (5.8); p=0.33; and T3 10.4 (7.0) vs. 9.0 (5.8), p=0.15. There was a statistically significant decrease in sensory/psychological (P=0.027) and procedural (P=0.03) concerns, but there was no statistically significant difference between groups for the prevalence, severity and bother of most chemotherapy side‐effects (nausea, infection, hair loss, mouth and throat problem and fatigue) except vomiting at T3.
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than usual care in patients commencing chemotherapy.",no_spin," Sure, I'd be happy to help you summarize the abstract for your fifth grader!

The study was about a group of people who were going to start chemotherapy treatment for cancer. The researchers wanted to see if a special education program could help reduce the patients' stress and anxiety during treatment. They tested the program on a group of patients and compared the results to a group that didn't receive the program.

The results showed that the education program didn't really help reduce stress and anxiety for the patients. The patients who received the program had similar levels of stress and anxiety as the patients who didn't receive the program. The researchers also looked at other aspects of the treatment, such as side effects like nausea and hair loss, and found that the education program didn't make a significant difference in these areas either.

So, the study found that the education program wasn't effective in reducing stress and anxiety for patients undergoing chemotherapy. It's important to note that this study didn't find a positive result, but it's still useful information because it helps us understand what doesn't work, which can help us find better solutions in the future."

Treatment A, has activity alone and in combination with docetaxel (Taxotere) and prednisone (DP) in metastatic castration‐resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). A randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled phase II trial compared DP combined with either treatment A (A) or placebo in chemonaive mCRPC.
Patients and methods:
Men with progressive mCRPC despite androgen deprivation were eligible and randomized 1:1. Patients received docetaxel (75 mg/m2 day 1) and prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily every 21 days with either treatment A or placebo twice daily orally on days 1‐3. The primary end point was overall survival (OS).
Results:
Two hundred and twenty‐one patients were randomly assigned. Median OS for treatment A plus docetaxel‐prednisone (ADP) and placebo‐DP was 18.1 versus 17.8 months [hazard ratio (HR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.72‐1.55, P=0.63]. Secondary end points were also not statistically different. Grade 3/4 toxic effects for ADP versus placebo‐DP were cardiac events (5% versus 2%), lymphopenia (23% versus 16%), neutropenia (47% versus 40%), ileus (2% versus 0%) and pulmonary embolism (6% versus 2%). In a subgroup of high‐risk mCRPC (n=34), outcomes appeared to favor ADP (median OS 19 versus 14 months).
Conclusion:
Treatment A was tolerable but did not extend OS when combined with DP in mCRPC; a potential benefit was observed in high‐risk patients.",spin," Sure, I'd be happy to help you summarize the abstract in a way that a fifth grader can understand!

The study was about a new treatment for a type of cancer called prostate cancer. The researchers wanted to see if the new treatment, called ""treatment A,"" would help people with prostate cancer live longer. They gave some people treatment A and some people a fake treatment (called a ""placebo"") and compared how well they did.

The study found that treatment A didn't really help people with prostate cancer live longer than the fake treatment. In fact, the two groups had pretty similar results. But, the researchers did notice that a small group of people with a more aggressive form of prostate cancer seemed to do a little better with treatment A.

It's important to note that the study didn't find any strong evidence that treatment A works better than the fake treatment. The researchers were trying to make the study sound more positive than it actually was, which is called ""spin."" So, we need to be a little careful when looking at the results of this study.

In summary, the study was trying to see if treatment A would help people with prostate cancer live longer, but it didn't really work. A small group of people with a more aggressive form of cancer might have done a little better with treatment A, but we need to be"

The study was about a new treatment for a type of cancer called metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The treatment was tested in a group of 221 patients who were randomly assigned to receive either the new treatment or a placebo (a fake treatment that doesn't actually do anything). The patients received the treatment or placebo along with two other medications that are commonly used to treat this type of cancer.

The researchers looked at how well the treatment worked by measuring how long the patients lived. They found that the patients who received the new treatment lived for about 18 months on average, while the patients who received the placebo lived for about 17.8 months on average. This means that the new treatment didn't really make a big difference in how long the patients lived.

The researchers also looked at some other measures of how well the treatment worked, like how many patients had side effects and how severe those side effects were. They found that some patients who received the new treatment had more side effects than patients who received the placebo, but overall, the side effects weren't too severe.

So, in summary, the study found that the new treatment didn't really work any better than the placebo in treating metastatic castration-resistant"

A phase III study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) to evaluate the effect on response rate and survival of a treatment A.
Patients and methods:
Four hundred fifty‐six patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B in combination with 5‐FU (500 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) i.v., every 21 days for a maximum of six cycles (eight in case of CR).
Results:
Of 456 patients, 390 were evaluable for efficacy. Objective response (CR + PR) was seen in 57% (treatment A) vs. 41% (comparator B) of the evaluable patients (P = 0.003). The CR rate was higher in the treatment A arm (12% vs. 7%, P = 0.07). Treatment A produced significantly higher response rates in patients with visceral localization (50% vs. 34%, P = 0.011) and in patients with more than two metastatic organ sites (64% vs. 37%, P = 0.001). Median time to progression (7.6 vs. 7 months) and overall survival (18 months vs. 17 months) were similar. Myelosuppression was the principal toxic effect, with grade IV neutropenia observed in 57% of the patients treated with treatment A vs. 9% of those on comparator B. Grade IV infection or febrile neutropenia were observed in 8% (treatment A) vs. 0.4% (comparator B), but the incidence of septic death was the same in the two arms (two patients each). Cardiac toxicity was similar in the two treatment groups, with 5% vs. 3% of the patients taken off study due to cardiac events, primarily due to a decline in LVEF. Only three patients (two in treatment A) experienced congestive heart failure.
Conclusion:
This trial shows that treatment A can be administered for repeated cycles without bone marrow support with increased, though acceptable, toxicity and with a significant increase of antitumor effect (especially in visceral and/or high‐burden disease), but no increased survival.",spin," Sure, I'd be happy to help you summarize the abstract in a way that a fifth grader can understand!

The study was done to see if a new treatment for breast cancer worked well. The researchers tested the treatment on 456 patients who had breast cancer that had spread to other parts of their body. They wanted to see if the treatment could shrink the cancer or make it go away.

The treatment was given to some patients along with two other medicines, and the researchers looked at how well it worked compared to a different treatment. They found that the new treatment worked a little better than the other treatment, but it also had more side effects.

The researchers looked at how well the treatment worked in different groups of patients, like those who had cancer in their organs or those who had a lot of cancer in their body. They found that the treatment worked better for those patients.

But, the researchers also found that the treatment didn't help people live longer. They also found that some patients had serious side effects, like low white blood cell count, infection, or heart problems.

So, the study shows that the new treatment can work for some patients, but it's not perfect and has some risks. It's important for doctors to carefully look at the results of this study and others before deciding which treatment to give to their patients."

The study was done to see if a new treatment for breast cancer worked better than an older treatment. The researchers tested the new treatment on 456 patients and compared it to the older treatment. They looked at how many patients had their cancer shrink or go away and how long they lived.

The results showed that the new treatment didn't work better than the older treatment. The cancer shrunk or went away in 57% of the patients who got the new treatment, but it also shrunk or went away in 41% of the patients who got the older treatment. The patients who got the new treatment lived for a median of 18 months, while the patients who got the older treatment lived for a median of 17 months.

The researchers also looked at the side effects of the treatments. They found that the new treatment caused more severe side effects, like low white blood cell count and infection, than the older treatment.

So, in summary, the study found that the new treatment didn't work better than the older treatment and had more side effects."
