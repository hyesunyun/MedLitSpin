We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.\nMethods:\nWe randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30\u201070 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two\u2010sided.\nResults:\n2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66\u20101.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64\u20101.09; P = .177) between the two arms. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs (38 in the treatment A arm versus 40 in the control arm), incidence of distant metastasis (HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.79\u20101.22; P = .858), and all\u2010cause mortality (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.92\u20101.48; P = .215).\nConclusion:\nTreatment A was not more effective than no treatment in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.",

They tested this medicine on 2972 women, and half of them took the medicine and half of them didn't take it. They followed these women for 7 years and looked at how many of them got breast cancer again.\n\nThe results were a little surprising. The researchers found that the medicine didn't do a very good job of preventing breast cancer from coming back in these women. In fact, there were almost the same number of women in both groups who got breast cancer again. So, the researchers concluded that treatment A isn't very effective at preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.\n\nIt's important to remember that this study only looked at one type of medicine, and there are many other things that can help prevent breast cancer from coming back. These things might include things like eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and getting regular check-ups with your doctor.\n\nI hope that helps!

This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy of treatment A in HER\u20102\u2010negative and HER\u20102\u2010uncharacterized MBC.\nPatients and methods:\nWomen with MBC were randomly assigned to first\u2010line therapy with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks plus treatment A or placebo. A preplanned retrospective evaluation of HER\u20102 status was performed using fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry.

In 86 HER\u20102\u2010positive patients (15%), treatment with paclitaxel\u2010 treatment A resulted in statistically significant improvements in TTP, EFS, ORR, and CBR compared with paclitaxel\u2010placebo. No differences between treatment groups were observed for any end point in HER\u20102\u2010negative patients. The most common adverse events were alopecia, rash, and diarrhea.

        "abstract": "In this double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled study, 363 patients with untreated multiple myeloma were randomized to receive either melphalan\u2010prednisone and treatment A or melphalan\u2010prednisone and placebo. The dose of melphalan was 0.25 mg/kg and prednisone was 100 mg given daily for 4 days every 6 weeks until plateau phase. The primary outcome was overall survival. A total of 357 patients were analyzed. The median survival was 29 months (95% [CI], 25\u201038 months) in the treatment A arm and 32 months (95% [CI], 27\u201038 months) in the placebo arm; p=0.35. There was no statistically significant difference in progression free survival between the 2 arms with medians of 15 months 95% CI [12\u201019] for the treatment A arm and 14 months 95% CI [11\u201018] for the placebo arm. Partial response was 34% and 33%, and very good partial response or better was 23% and 7% in the treatment A and placebo arms, respectively (P < .001). Constipation, neuropathy, non\u2010neuropathy neurologic toxicity, and skin reactions were significantly more frequent in the treatment A arm. The number of thromboembolic events was 8% in both arms. In conclusion, treatment A was not more effective than placebo on overall survival in patients with multiple myeloma.",

Here's a summary of the passage in a way that a fifth grader can understand:\n\nDoctors did a special test to see which treatment works better for people with a sickness called multiple myeloma. They gave some patients a medicine called melphalan-prednisone and some patients a pretend medicine (called a placebo). They followed the patients for a long time and looked at how long they lived. They found that the patients who got the real medicine lived a little longer than the patients who got the pretend medicine. But they didn't find any big difference in how long they lived between the two groups. They also looked at how well the treatments worked in terms of making the patients feel better and reducing the sickness. They found that one group had more side effects than the other, but the difference wasn't big enough to matter. In the end, the doctors concluded that the real medicine didn't work any better than the pretend medicine for these patients with multiple myeloma.\n\nI hope this helps!

PLD is like a special medicine that doctors use to try to kill the cancer cells.\n\nThe study found that the treatment A and PLD worked a little bit better than just PLD. The cancer didn't grow as fast in the people who got treatment A and PLD. But it wasn't a big difference, so it's not like the treatment was a magic cure or anything.\n\nThe study also found that some people who got treatment A and PLD had fewer side effects than the people who just got PLD. Side effects are when the treatment makes you feel sick or uncomfortable. Some people got a rash on their hands and feet, and some people got sore mouths and throats. But the people who got treatment A and PLD had fewer of these side effects.\n"

The primary end point was progression\u2010free survival (PFS). Other end points were objective response rate, and safety. The study was originally planned for 244 patients. The trial was temporarily placed on hold after 125 patients were randomized while the results of another trial were being reviewed and the sponsor decided not to resume enrollment.

ORR was 12.3% for treatment A + PLD vs. 8.3% for PLD, p=0.5640.

There was a statistically significant decrease in sensory/psychological (P=0.027) and procedural (P=0.03) concerns, but there was no statistically significant difference between groups for the prevalence, severity and bother of most chemotherapy side\u2010effects (nausea, infection, hair loss, mouth and throat problem and fatigue) except vomiting at T3.\nConclusion:\nTreatment A was not more effective than usual care in patients commencing chemotherapy.",

It's a special medicine that doctors give to people who have cancer to help kill the bad cells in their body. But sometimes, the medicine can make people feel sick or uncomfortable.\n\nA long time ago, some doctors thought that if they taught people about chemotherapy before they started taking it, it might help them feel less scared or worried about it. So they did a big study to see if that was true.\n\nThey found out that the special teaching didn't really help much. Even though the doctors taught people about chemotherapy, they still felt just as scared and worried as they did before.\n\nThe doctors were a little disappointed, but they learned something important. They learned that it's important to teach people about chemotherapy, but they also need to find other ways to help them feel better and less scared.\n\nSo, even though the special teaching didn't work as well as they hoped, it's still important to learn about chemotherapy and how it can help people with cancer feel better."
