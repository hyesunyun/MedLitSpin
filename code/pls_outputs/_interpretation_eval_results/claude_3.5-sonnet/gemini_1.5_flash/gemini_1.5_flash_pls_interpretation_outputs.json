We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.\nMethods:\nWe randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30\u201070 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two\u2010sided.\nResults:\n2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66\u20101.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64\u20101.09; P = .177) between the two arms. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs (38 in the treatment A arm versus 40 in the control arm), incidence of distant metastasis (HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.79\u20101.22; P = .858), and all\u2010cause mortality (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.92\u20101.48; P = .215).\nConclusion:\nTreatment A was not more effective than no treatment in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.",

They already knew it worked in lab tests on animals.\n\nThey found almost 3000 women who had already had breast cancer.  They randomly split them into two groups: one group got Treatment A every day for 5 years, and the other group didn't get any treatment.  It was like flipping a coin to decide which group each woman went into.\n\nThe scientists carefully watched both groups for 7 years to see if anyone got breast cancer again (in the other breast or the same breast). They also checked for cancer in other parts of the body and if anyone died.\n\nAfter 7 years, they looked at the results.  They found that there wasn't a big difference between the two groups.  About the same number of women in both groups got breast cancer again, or got cancer somewhere else, or died.  The medicine didn't seem to help prevent a second breast cancer.\n\nSo, the scientists concluded that Treatment A didn't work better than doing nothing to prevent a second breast cancer in these women.\n",

In responding patients, median DOR (from randomization to progression) was 19.0 months for treatment A and 10.8 months for comparator B. Using all patients, DOR was significantly greater for treatment A compared with comparator B; the ratio of average response durations was 1.35 (95% CI, 1.10 to 1.67; P < 0.01). Both treatments were well tolerated.\nConclusion:\nTreatment A was at least as effective as comparator B, with efficacy end points slightly favoring treatment A. Treatment A represents an additional treatment option for postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer whose disease progresses on tamoxifen therapy.",

ORR was 42.6% (95% confidence interval (CI), 33.1 to 52.5) for CAF + placebo compared with 53.1% (95% CI, 43.5 to 62.5) for treatment A + CAF (P = .077). The median progression\u2010free survival (PFS) was 241 days for CAF + placebo v 366 days for treatment A + CAF; P = .145. Any adverse event occurred more frequently with CAF + treatment A, 95.5% vs. 88.4%, p=0.025. Neutropenia occurred for 91.2% with CAF + treatment A vs 77.7% with CAF + placebo, p=0.005. Treatment with treatment A did not affect the plasma concentration of doxorubicin.\nConclusion:\nTreatment A + CAF was not more effective than CAF + placebo in patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer.",

This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy of treatment A in HER\u20102\u2010negative and HER\u20102\u2010uncharacterized MBC.\nPatients and methods:\nWomen with MBC were randomly assigned to first\u2010line therapy with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks plus treatment A or placebo. A preplanned retrospective evaluation of HER\u20102 status was performed using fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry.

In 86 HER\u20102\u2010positive patients (15%), treatment with paclitaxel\u2010 treatment A resulted in statistically significant improvements in TTP, EFS, ORR, and CBR compared with paclitaxel\u2010placebo.

        "abstract": "Background:\nWe aimed to compare overall survival in patients receiving treatment A or comparator B.\nMethods:\nThis was an open\u2010label randomized trial undertaken in 50 centres across eight countries. 1006 treatment\u2010naive patients diagnosed with advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma were randomly allocated (1 to 1) by minimization to receive comparator B or treatment A. Treatment was not masked. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Treatment groups were compared with a non\u2010stratified log\u2010 rank test. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN XXXX.\nFindings:\n502 patients were randomly assigned to receive comparator B and 504 to receive combined treatment A. Median follow\u2010up was 37.2 months (24.8\u201052.3). Median overall survival was 18.8 months (17.0\u201023.2) for patients receiving comparator B versus 18.6 months (16.5\u201020.6) for those receiving treatment A. Overall survival did not differ between the two groups (hazard ratio 1.05 [95% CI 0.90\u20101.21], p=0.55; absolute difference 0.3% (\u20105.1 to 5.6) at 1 year and 2.7% (\u20108.2 to 2.9) at 3 years). Serious adverse events were reported in 113 (23%) patients receiving comparator B and 131 (26%) of those receiving combined treatment A.\nInterpretation:\nAlthough treatment A does not improve overall or progression\u2010free survival compared with comparator B, treatment A might still have a role because it can produce remissions that are of clinically relevant length in some patients. Identification of patients who will benefit from treatment A is crucial.",

Overall survival was similar in the treatment A and OBS arms (median, 10.9 v 10.7 months, respectively; P = .89). Treatment A reduced the 2\u2010year relapse rate both at initial sites (surgery: 59% to 27%, P < .001; radiosurgery: 31% to 19%, P = .040) and at new sites (surgery: 42% to 23%, P = .008; radiosurgery: 48% to 33%, P = .023). Salvage therapies were used more frequently after OBS than after treatment A. Intracranial progression caused death in 78 (44%) of 179 patients in the OBS arm and in 50 (28%) of 180 patients in the treatment A arm.\nConclusion:\nAfter radiosurgery or surgery of a limited number of brain metastases, treatment A reduces intracranial relapses and neurologic deaths but fails to improve the duration of functional independence and overall survival.",

Treatment A produced significantly higher response rates in patients with visceral localization (50% vs. 34%, P = 0.011) and in patients with more than two metastatic organ sites (64% vs. 37%, P = 0.001). Median time to progression (7.6 vs. 7 months) and overall survival (18 months vs. 17 months) were similar.

Grade IV infection or febrile neutropenia were observed in 8% (treatment A) vs. 0.4% (comparator B), but the incidence of septic death was the same in the two arms (two patients each). Cardiac toxicity was similar in the two treatment groups, with 5% vs. 3% of the patients taken off study due to cardiac events, primarily due to a decline in LVEF.
