        "abstract": "Background:\nTreatment A has been shown to inhibit breast carcinogenesis in preclinical studies. We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.\nMethods:\nWe randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30\u201070 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two\u2010sided.\nResults:\n2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66\u20101.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64\u20101.09; P = .177) between the two arms. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs (38 in the treatment A arm versus 40 in the control arm), incidence of distant metastasis (HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.79\u20101.22; P = .858), and all\u2010cause mortality (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.92\u20101.48; P = .215).\nConclusion:\nTreatment A was not more effective than no treatment in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.",

The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization.

The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.

Between January 1997 and January 2002, 211 consecutive patients with T2\u20104, N0\u20101, M0 breast cancer were randomized to receive either epirubicin alone (EPI) or epirubicin plus treatment A. Ki67 expression was evaluated immunohistochemically in tumor specimens obtained before chemotherapy by incision biopsy and at definitive surgery. Tumor shrinkage of >50% was obtained in 76% of patients randomized in the EPI arm and 81.9% of patients randomized in the EPI+treatment A arm (not significant). The corresponding rates of clinical and pathological complete response were 20.2 and 21.9% (not significant), and 4.8 and 6.7% (not significant), respectively. Pathologically complete response was more frequently observed in estrogen receptor (ER)\u2010negative (ER\u2010) tumors (P=0.04) and correlated with elevated baseline Ki67 expression (P<0.01). Both EPI treatment and EPI+treatment A resulted in a significant reduction in Ki67 expression, either in overall patients (P=0.000) or in patients with ER+ breast cancer (P=0.000). The reduction in Ki67 immunostaining in the EPI+treatment A arm was greater than in the EPI arm, leading to a lower Ki67 expression at post\u2010operative residual histology (P=0.0041). The addition of treatment A to epirubicin chemotherapy did not improve the response rate but led to a significantly higher reduction in the Ki67 expression. Baseline elevated Ki67 expression and the ER\u2010 statuses were both associated with a greater chance of obtaining a pathological complete response at residual histology.",

This report presents the clinical results with a median follow\u2010up of 60 months.\nPatients and methods:\nBetween February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery.\nResults:\nThere was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5\u2010year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence\u2010free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis\u2010free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76). Nevertheless, in the node\u2010positive subgroup, the 5\u2010year LRFS was statistically better in the treatment A arm (97% in treatment A v 91% in comparator B; P = .02), corresponding to a risk of locoregional recurrence decreased by 39% (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.93).\nConclusion:\nThis treatment protocol remains an appealing clinical option for many women with operable breast cancer at a high risk of recurrence. Combination treatments with new drugs for breast cancer are warranted.",

        "plain_language_summary": "This study compared two different treatments for breast cancer to see which one worked better. The treatments were given after surgery to remove the cancer. The study looked at how long the patients stayed cancer-free, how often the cancer came back in the same area, how often it spread to other parts of the body, and how long the patients lived overall.\n\nThe results showed that both treatments were about the same in most areas. However, in a group of patients who had cancer in their lymph nodes, treatment A was slightly better at preventing the cancer from coming back in the same area.\n\nOverall, this treatment is still a good option for many women with breast cancer who are at high risk of the cancer coming back. It also shows that trying new drugs in combination with this treatment could be helpful.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:\nThis phase III study compared the efficacy and safety of treatment A with comparator B in advanced breast cancer.\nPatients and methods:\nPatients were randomly assigned to treatment A or comparator B. Comparison of progression\u2010free survival (PFS) was the primary objective.\nResults:\nPatient characteristics were balanced between arms (N = 305). Median PFS was 8.05 months (95% CI, 6.60 to 8.71) for treatment A and 7.98 (95% CI, 6.93 to 8.77) for comparator B (log\u2010rank P = .121). Overall response rate (ORR) was 32% in both arms, and overall survival (OS) was not different between arms (P = .983). Time to treatment failure (TTF; defined as discontinuation, progressive disease, death as a result of any cause, or the start of a new anticancer therapy) was superior in the treatment A arm (P = .059). Hematologic toxicity was similar in both arms, except for grades 3 to 4 leukopenia (treatment A, 78%; comparator B, 66%; P = .025) and transfusions (treatment A, 17%; comparator B, 7%; P = .0051). Grades 3 to 4 diarrhea, mucositis, and hand\u2010and\u2010foot syndrome were significantly higher in the comparator B arm. Fewer patients in the treatment A arm discontinued because of drug\u2010related adverse events (13% v 27% in CD; P = .002).\nConclusion:\nNo difference was observed between treatment A and comparator B arms in PFS, ORR, and OS. TTF was longer in the treatment A arm. These findings, combined with a nonhematologic toxicity profile that favors treatment A over approved doses of comparator B, suggest that treatment A may be a better option than comparator B in this clinical setting.",

The researchers looked at how long patients went without their cancer getting worse (called progression-free survival), and they found that there was no significant difference between the two treatments. They also looked at the overall response rate (how many patients had a positive response to the treatment) and overall survival (how long patients lived), and again, there was no significant difference.\n\nHowever, they did find that patients on treatment A had a longer time before they had to stop the treatment due to problems or side effects. Treatment A also had fewer severe side effects like diarrhea, mouth sores, and hand and foot problems compared to treatment B. Additionally, fewer patients on treatment A had to stop the treatment because of these side effects.\n\nSo, based on this study, it seems that treatment A might be a better option than treatment B for advanced breast cancer because it has fewer side effects and allows patients to continue treatment for a longer time.",

Depression, which is prevalent among cancer patients, may be a barrier to cessation.\nMethods:\nThis double\u2010blind placebo\u2010controlled trial randomized 246 cancer patients to 9 weeks of placebo or treatment A, stratifying by pre\u2010treatment depression symptoms. In addition, all patients received transdermal nicotine and behavioral counseling.

        "abstract": "Objective:\nTo evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment A in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in platinum\u2010resistant ovarian cancer (OC).\nMethods:\nPatients with platinum\u2010refractory or \u2010resistant primary or secondary) OC were randomized to receive treatment A and PLD at 50 mg/m2 intravenously or PLD alone at 50 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 every 28 days until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression\u2010free survival (PFS). Other end points were objective response rate and safety. The study was originally planned for 244 patients. The trial was temporarily placed on hold after 125 patients were randomized while the results of another trial were being reviewed and the sponsor decided not to resume enrollment. The interim analysis became the final analysis.\nResults:\nThe median PFS was 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD (n = 65) versus 3.7 months for PLD (n = 60) (hazards ratio, 0.92; P = 0.7243). A preplanned subgroup analysis showed that 75 patients with platinum\u2010refractory or primary platinum\u2010resistant OC had a median PFS of 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD versus 2.9 months for PLD (hazards ratio, 0.55; P = 0.0425). Hematologic adverse events were 66% on the treatment A + PLD arm versus 44% on the PLD arm, manageable with dose reductions. Nonhematologic adverse events were similar for both arms. The incidence of palmar\u2010plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis was lower on treatment A + PLD (23%, 31%, respectively) versus (39%, 49%, respectively) on PLD.\nConclusion:\nOverall median PFS showed a positive trend but was not statistically significant. The median PFS in the platinum\u2010refractory and primary platinum\u2010resistant OC patients was significantly longer for treatment A + PLD versus PLD. Treatment A may ameliorate the palmar\u2010plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis known to be associated with PLD. Further study of this active well\u2010tolerated regimen in platinum\u2010refractory and primary platinum\u2010resistant OC is planned. This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov",

The study included patients who had already tried other treatments that didn't work.\n\nThe patients were divided into two groups: one group received treatment A and PLD, and the other group received only PLD. They were given these treatments once a month until their tumors started growing again or they experienced too many side effects.\n\nThe main thing the researchers looked at was how long it took for the tumors to start growing again. They found that the group of patients who received treatment A and PLD had a slightly longer time without tumor growth compared to the group that only received PLD. However, this difference was not big enough to be considered statistically significant.\n\nBut there was some good news! When they looked at a smaller group of patients who had a specific type of ovarian cancer, they found that the combination of treatment A and PLD did make a significant difference. These patients had a longer time without tumor growth compared to those who only received PLD.\n\nThe researchers also found that the combination of treatment A and PLD caused fewer side effects like hand and foot pain and mouth sores compared to PLD alone.\n\nOverall, this study suggests that treatment A might be helpful when used with PLD for certain types of ovarian cancer.

        "journal": "J Support Oncol",
        "abstract": "Sleep disorders are a substantial problem for cancer survivors, with prevalence estimates ranging from 23% to 61%. Although numerous prescription hypnotics are available, few are approved for long\u2010term use or have demonstrated benefit in this circumstance. Hypnotics may have unwanted side effects and are costly, and cancer survivors often wish to avoid prescription drugs. New options with limited side effects are needed. The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of treatment A for sleep in people with cancer who were undergoing cancer treatment. Participants were randomized to receive treatment A or placebo orally 1 hour before bedtime for 8 weeks. The primary end point was area under the curve (AUC) of the overall Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Secondary outcomes included the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Toxicity was evaluated with both self\u2010reported numeric analogue scale questions and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0. Questionnaires were completed at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks. A total of 227 patients were randomized into this study between March 19, 2004, and March 9, 2007, with 119 being evaluable for the primary end point. The AUC over the 8 weeks for treatment A was 51.4 (SD = 16), while that for placebo was 49.7 (SD = 15), with a P value of 0.6957. A supplemental, exploratory analysis revealed that several fatigue end points, as measured by the BFI and POMS, were significantly better for those taking treatment A over placebo. Participants also reported less trouble with sleep and less drowsiness on treatment A than placebo. There were no significant differences in toxicities as measured by self\u2010report or the CTCAE except for mild alkaline phosphatase increases, which were slightly more common in the placebo group. This study failed to provide data to support the hypothesis that treatment A, at bedtime could improve sleep as measured by the PSQI. However, exploratory analyses revealed improvement in some secondary outcomes, such as fatigue. Further research with treatment A exploring physiologic effects in oncology symptom management may be warranted.",

        "journal": "J Support Oncol",
        "abstract": "Sleep disorders are a substantial problem for cancer survivors, with prevalence estimates ranging from 23% to 61%. Although numerous prescription hypnotics are available, few are approved for long\u2010term use or have demonstrated benefit in this circumstance. Hypnotics may have unwanted side effects and are costly, and cancer survivors often wish to avoid prescription drugs. New options with limited side effects are needed. The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of a treatment A for sleep in people with cancer who were undergoing cancer treatment. Participants were randomized to receive treatment A or placebo orally 1 hour before bedtime for 8 weeks. The primary end point was area under the curve (AUC) of the overall Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Secondary outcomes included the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Toxicity was evaluated with both self\u2010reported numeric analogue scale questions and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0. Questionnaires were completed at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks. A total of 227 patients were randomized into this study between March 19, 2004, and March 9, 2007. Twenty\u2010three patients withdrew before starting the study treatment. Primary end\u2010point data were available on 119 patients (62 receiving treatment A and 57 receiving placebo). Baseline characteristics and baseline patient reported outcomes were well balanced between arms. The AUC over the 8 weeks for treatment A was 51.4 (SD = 16 and for placebo was 49.7 (SD = 15), with a P value of 0.7. The FOSQ was not statistically significantly different between groups. There was no statistically significant difference between groups for the POMS week 8 treatment A 6.9 vs. placebo 6.0; p=0.90. For the BFI at week 8 the treatment A and placebo arm scored respectively for fatigue now 22.1 vs. 10.5; p<0.01; for usual fatigue 19.4 vs. 10.0; p=0.05; for worst fatigue 14.8 vs. 12.4; p=0.65; and for activity inference 12.3 vs. 10.8; p=0.75.There were no significant differences in toxicities as measured by self\u2010report or the CTCAE. Treatment A was not more effective than placebo on sleep quality in patients who were undergoing cancer treatment.",

        "plain_language_summary": "This study looked at whether a certain treatment could help improve sleep in people who have cancer and are going through treatment. They gave some patients the treatment and others a fake pill called a placebo. They then asked the patients questions about their sleep and how they were feeling. The results showed that the treatment did not work better than the placebo in helping with sleep. However, it was found that the treatment did have some positive effects on reducing fatigue, which means feeling less tired. Overall, the study concluded that the treatment was not effective in improving sleep quality in cancer patients.",
