Randomized trial of fenretinide to prevent second breast malignancy in women with early breast cancer",J Natl Cancer Inst,"Background:
Treatment A has been shown to inhibit breast carcinogenesis in preclinical studies. We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.
Methods:
We randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30‐70 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66‐1.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64‐1.09; P = .177) between the two arms. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs (38 in the treatment A arm versus 40 in the control arm), incidence of distant metastasis (HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.79‐1.22; P = .858), and all‐cause mortality (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.92‐1.48; P = .215).

Methods:
We randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30‐70 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) or no treatment. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. Other end points considered post hoc were the same outcomes stratified by menopausal status, incidence of distant metastases, overall mortality, and tumors in other organs.

At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (P =.642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (P =.177) between the two arms. However, an interaction was detected between treatment A and menopausal status in both outcomes (P for interaction in both outcomes =.045), with a possible beneficial effect in premenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66, and 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.41‐1.07; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 0.65, and 95% CI = 0.46‐0. 92) and an opposite effect in postmenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.32, and 95% CI = 0.82‐2.15; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.19, and 95% CI = 0.75‐1. 89). There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs, incidence of distant metastasis, and all‐cause mortality.

Patients and methods:
Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with estrogen receptor (ER)‐positive or ER‐unknown metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization.
Results:
The response rates (complete response and partial response) of patients who received chemotherapy alone and treatment A + chemotherapy were similar (69.2% v 68.9%, respectively; P =.99).

Efficacy and safety of treatment A was compared with comparator B in a group of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, without previous systemic therapy for advanced breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
The study was a prospective double‐blind randomized trial. All treated patients presented with positive estrogen receptors. Main end points were response rates, toxicity profile analysis, time to progression and survival. WHO and ECOG criteria were employed for response evaluation while toxicity was assessed according to WHO guidelines. Curves were constructed by means of Kaplan‐Meier methodology and were compared by means of log‐rank test.
Results:

From June 1997 until November 2000, 604 patients with T1‐3N1M0 or T3N0M0 tumors were randomized to three cycles of epirubicin 110 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of treatment A followed by three cycles of 'intensified' CMF (cyclophosphamide 840 mg/m2, methotrexate 47 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 840 mg/m2) (group A), or to four cycles of epirubicin followed by four cycles of CMF, as in group A (group B). All cycles were given every 2 weeks with granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor support.
Results:
A total of 595 patients were eligible. Median follow‐up was 61.7 months for group A and 62 months for group B. DFS and OS did not differ significantly between treatment groups (log‐rank P = 0.55 and P = 0.38, respectively). The 3‐year DFS was 80% in group A and 77% in group B. Survival rates were 93% and 90%, respectively. Comparison of quality of life outcomes between the two groups showed no statistically significant differences. Both regimens were well tolerated and severe acute side‐effects were infrequent. No cases of severe cardiotoxicity or acute leukemia were recorded.
Conclusion:
Treatment A with a dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy was not more effective than a dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy alone in patients with high‐risk operable breast cancer.",no_spin,"Doctors wanted to see if a new medicine (let's call it Treatment A) would help people with a serious type of breast cancer live longer and stay healthy longer.

They looked at two groups of people with this cancer.  One group got the standard treatment (let's call it the regular treatment) plus Treatment A. The other group got only the regular treatment.  Both groups got medicine in cycles, meaning they took medicine for a while, then had a break, then took it again.  They all got medicine to help their bodies fight the cancer and to help them feel better.

The doctors watched both groups for a long time (about 5 years).  They checked how long the people in each group lived without the cancer coming back (disease-free survival) and how long they lived overall (overall survival).  They also looked at how the treatments affected the people's quality of life.

The results showed that Treatment A didn't make a big difference.  Both groups did about the same in terms of how long they lived and how healthy they felt.  So, the new treatment wasn't better than the regular treatment.

To determine whether treatment A, improves survival in patients with brain metastases when used as an adjunct to whole‐brain radiation therapy (WBRT).
Patients and methods:
Patients with brain metastases from solid tumors and a Karnofsky performance score of > or = 70 were randomly assigned to receive WBRT with supplemental oxygen and either treatment A (treatment A arm) or no treatment (control arm). The primary end point was survival.
Results:
The study consisted of 515 eligible patients (treatment A arm, n = 265; control arm, n = 250). The median survival time (MST) was 5.4 months for the treatment A arm versus 4.4 months for the control arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87; P = .16). For the subgroup of patients with non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or breast cancer, the MST was 6.0 and 4.4 months, respectively (HR = 0.82; P = .07). Cox multiple regression analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of death for the treatment A arm in both primary populations. Further analysis indicated that the benefit may be restricted to the subgroup of patients with breast cancer. Response rates (radiographic complete response plus partial response) improved by 7% (P = .10) and 13% (P = .01) for all patients and for NSCLC and breast cancer patients in the treatment A arm, respectively. The most common severe adverse event in patients treated with treatment A was hypoxemia, which was reversible and effectively managed with supplemental oxygen in most patients.
Conclusion:
The addition of treatment A to WBRT may improve response rates and survival in patients with brain metastases, particularly metastases from breast cancer. A confirmatory trial for breast cancer patients has been initiated.",spin,"Doctors wanted to see if a new treatment (let's call it Treatment A) helps people with brain tumors live longer.  They looked at people who had brain tumors from other cancers (like lung or breast cancer) and gave half of them Treatment A along with radiation therapy (a treatment that uses beams of energy to kill cancer cells). The other half got only the radiation therapy.

The doctors tracked how long each person lived.  The people who got Treatment A lived a little longer, about 5.4 months on average, compared to 4.4 months for those who didn't get Treatment A.  This difference wasn't huge, but it was a little better for some groups, like people with breast cancer, who lived even longer with Treatment A.

The treatment seemed to help some people get better, too.  More people who got Treatment A had their tumors shrink or disappear completely.  The most common side effect of Treatment A was low oxygen in the blood, but it was usually fixed with extra oxygen.

Overall, Treatment A might help people with brain tumors live longer, especially those with breast cancer.  The doctors are now doing another study just for people with breast cancer to be sure.

To compare treatment A and comparator B in node‐positive, operable breast cancer patients.
Methods and materials:
This was a randomized, multicenter, phase III trial enrolling 638 eligible women with prior breast surgery and positive axillary dissection.

Results:
Median treatment durations were 64 and 126 days (Arms A and B, respectively), with no significant difference in overall or disease‐free survival. Five‐year locoregional relapse‐free survival favored patients with conservative surgery (two thirds of the population), with less local and / or regional recurrence in Arm A than in Arm B (3% vs. 9%; p = 0.01).

Patients and methods:
Between March 1991 and June 1999, 1863 women with stages I‐IIIA operable breast cancer who had undergone surgery and completed six cycles of adjuvant combination chemotherapy with either CMF, CAF, CEF, FAC or FEC were randomized to receive either treatment A for 3 years or no further treatment. Irrespective of menstrual status and hormone receptor content of the primary tumor, patients were stratified by institute, chemotherapy scheme and age (above 50 years or younger). The main end‐point was to detect a 5% increase in the 5 year survival (from 80% to 85%) in favor of treatment A. Secondary end‐ points were relapse free survival (RFS), local control, incidence of second primary breast cancer.
Results:
After exclusion of all patients from three sites because of inadequate documentation, a total of 1724 patients (93%) were analyzed (Treatment A 861 and Control 863). At a median follow‐up of 6.5 years, 396 deaths (23%) and 602 RFS events (35%) (relapse and/or death) have been observed.

Results:
The final analyzed populations were 1096 in the colposcopy only arm and 1090 in the colposcopy plus intervention A arm.

54,17264336,Phase III trial of concurrent or sequential adjuvant chemoradiotherapy after conservative surgery for early-stage breast cancer: final results of the ARCOSEIN trial,J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
In 1996, we initiated the multicenter phase III randomized trial to compare the effect on disease‐free survival (DFS) of experimental treatment A versus comparator B after breast‐conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer. This report presents the clinical results with a median follow‐up of 60 months.
Patients and methods:
Between February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial (358 randomized to comparator B and 358 to treatment A) and respectively 343 and 352 patients were included in the analysis. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery. The primary endpoint was disease‐free survival (DFS) defined as the time from randomization to the first treatment failure (in the ipsilateral breast, in the axillary/infraclavicular/IMCs, or at a distant site) or death (if no recurrence had been noted).
Results:
There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5‐year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis‐free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76).

They followed 716 women who had early-stage breast cancer and got breast-conserving surgery.  They gave half of them treatment A and half treatment B.  They watched them for 5 years to see if the cancer came back.

The results?  There was no difference between the two treatments.  Both treatments were equally good at keeping the cancer from coming back in the breast, nearby lymph nodes, or other parts of the body, and both treatments were equally good at keeping the women alive.  So, the new treatment wasn't better than the standard treatment.

After 5 years, there wasn't a big difference between the new treatment and the standard treatment for most women.  However, for women whose cancer had spread to nearby lymph nodes, the new treatment seemed to be slightly better at preventing cancer from coming back in the same area.  It was about 39% better.

So, the new treatment is a good option for some women, especially those at high risk of the cancer coming back.  More research is needed to see if combining the new treatment with other drugs might be even better.

Many cancer patients continue to smoke postdiagnosis, yet there have been few smoking cessation trials for this population. Depression, which is prevalent among cancer patients, may be a barrier to cessation.
Methods:
This double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial randomized 246 cancer patients to 9 weeks of placebo or treatment A, stratifying by pre‐treatment depression symptoms. In addition, all patients received transdermal nicotine and behavioral counseling. Primary outcomes were 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence, biochemically confirmed, at the end of treatment (Week 12), and at 6 months post quit day (Week 27).

The doctors checked if the patients stopped smoking for 7 days, and then again 6 months later.  They also looked at how the patients felt, their quality of life, and any side effects.

The results showed that Treatment A wasn't any better than the fake medicine at helping patients quit smoking.  Both groups quit smoking at about the same rate.  The patients who took Treatment A didn't have better or worse side effects, or changes in how they felt, compared to the patients who took the placebo.

A two‐arm, double‐blind, randomized trial was performed to evaluate the effect of treatment A on acute skin‐related toxicity in patients undergoing breast or chest wall radiotherapy.
Methods and materials:
Patients with ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast carcinoma who were undergoing external beam radiotherapy to the breast or chest wall were randomly assigned to apply treatment A or placebo cream daily. The primary study endpoint was the provider assessed maximal grade of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, radiation dermatitis. The secondary endpoints included provider‐assessed Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Grade 3 or greater radiation dermatitis and adverse event monitoring.

The doctors looked at how much skin irritation (like redness, pain, or itching) each group had.  They also asked the patients how their skin felt.  The results showed that the special cream didn't really help prevent skin problems any better than the regular cream.  Both groups had similar amounts of skin problems.

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment A in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer (OC).
Methods:
Patients with platinum‐refractory or ‐resistant primary or secondary) OC were randomized to receive treatment A and PLD at 50 mg/m2 intravenously or PLD alone at 50 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 every 28 days until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression‐free survival (PFS). Other end points were objective response rate and safety. The study was originally planned for 244 patients. The trial was temporarily placed on hold after 125 patients were randomized while the results of another trial were being reviewed and the sponsor decided not to resume enrollment. The interim analysis became the final analysis.
Results:
The median PFS was 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD (n = 65) versus 3.7 months for PLD (n = 60) (hazards ratio, 0.92; P = 0.7243). A preplanned subgroup analysis showed that 75 patients with platinum‐refractory or primary platinum‐resistant OC had a median PFS of 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD versus 2.9 months for PLD (hazards ratio, 0.55; P = 0.0425). Hematologic adverse events were 66% on the treatment A + PLD arm versus 44% on the PLD arm, manageable with dose reductions. Nonhematologic adverse events were similar for both arms. The incidence of palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis was lower on treatment A + PLD (23%, 31%, respectively) versus (39%, 49%, respectively) on PLD.
Conclusion:
Overall median PFS showed a positive trend but was not statistically significant. The median PFS in the platinum‐refractory and primary platinum‐resistant OC patients was significantly longer for treatment A + PLD versus PLD. Treatment A may ameliorate the palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis known to be associated with PLD.

At T2 and T3 treatment A did not significantly reduce patients distress with mean (SD) HADS scores respectively for routine care vs. treatment A at T2 10.9 (6.8) vs. 9.9 (5.8); p=0.33; and T3 10.4 (7.0) vs. 9.0 (5.8), p=0.15. There was a statistically significant decrease in sensory/psychological (P=0.027) and procedural (P=0.03) concerns, but there was no statistically significant difference between groups for the prevalence, severity and bother of most chemotherapy side‐effects (nausea, infection, hair loss, mouth and throat problem and fatigue) except vomiting at T3.
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than usual care in patients commencing chemotherapy.",no_spin,"Imagine you're getting ready for a big, scary game.  Doctors want to help you feel less worried and scared before the game starts.

Some kids (patients) were given extra help (Treatment A) to learn about what to expect before, during, and after the game (chemotherapy).  Other kids got regular help.

The doctors checked how worried and scared everyone felt before the game, right after the first part of the game, and right after the second part.

The extra help didn't really make the kids feel less worried overall.  But it *did* help with some worries, like the worries about how the game would feel on their bodies and the worries about the steps of the game.

The extra help didn't really help with other worries, like feeling sick from the game, losing their hair, or feeling tired.  It did help a little with one worry: feeling sick to their stomach.

So, the extra help wasn't better than the regular help in making the kids feel less worried overall.

Treatment A, has activity alone and in combination with docetaxel (Taxotere) and prednisone (DP) in metastatic castration‐resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). A randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled phase II trial compared DP combined with either treatment A (A) or placebo in chemonaive mCRPC.
Patients and methods:
Men with progressive mCRPC despite androgen deprivation were eligible and randomized 1:1. Patients received docetaxel (75 mg/m2 day 1) and prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily every 21 days with either treatment A or placebo twice daily orally on days 1‐3. The primary end point was overall survival (OS).
Results:
Two hundred and twenty‐one patients were randomly assigned. Median OS for treatment A plus docetaxel‐prednisone (ADP) and placebo‐DP was 18.1 versus 17.8 months [hazard ratio (HR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.72‐1.55, P=0.63]. Secondary end points were also not statistically different. Grade 3/4 toxic effects for ADP versus placebo‐DP were cardiac events (5% versus 2%), lymphopenia (23% versus 16%), neutropenia (47% versus 40%), ileus (2% versus 0%) and pulmonary embolism (6% versus 2%).

Doctors tried one treatment (let's call it ""Treatment A"") to see if it would help, along with other medicines (docetaxel and prednisone).

They gave this treatment to some people and a fake treatment (placebo) to others.  They wanted to see if Treatment A made a difference in how long the people lived.

They followed 221 people for a while.  The people who got Treatment A lived about the same amount of time as the people who got the fake treatment (18.1 months vs 17.8 months).  So, Treatment A didn't seem to help them live longer.

The doctors also looked at how sick the people got from the treatments.  Treatment A seemed to cause more heart problems, low blood cell counts, and other side effects, but not by a huge amount.

In a smaller group of people who were very sick, Treatment A might have helped a little bit, but it wasn't enough to say for sure.

Overall, the study showed that Treatment A wasn't better than the fake treatment for this type of cancer.

A phase III study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) to evaluate the effect on response rate and survival of a treatment A.
Patients and methods:
Four hundred fifty‐six patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B in combination with 5‐FU (500 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) i.v., every 21 days for a maximum of six cycles (eight in case of CR).
Results:
Of 456 patients, 390 were evaluable for efficacy. Objective response (CR + PR) was seen in 57% (treatment A) vs. 41% (comparator B) of the evaluable patients (P = 0.003). The CR rate was higher in the treatment A arm (12% vs. 7%, P = 0.07). Treatment A produced significantly higher response rates in patients with visceral localization (50% vs. 34%, P = 0.011) and in patients with more than two metastatic organ sites (64% vs. 37%, P = 0.001). Median time to progression (7.6 vs. 7 months) and overall survival (18 months vs. 17 months) were similar. Myelosuppression was the principal toxic effect, with grade IV neutropenia observed in 57% of the patients treated with treatment A vs. 9% of those on comparator B. Grade IV infection or febrile neutropenia were observed in 8% (treatment A) vs. 0.4% (comparator B), but the incidence of septic death was the same in the two arms (two patients each). Cardiac toxicity was similar in the two treatment groups, with 5% vs. 3% of the patients taken off study due to cardiac events, primarily due to a decline in LVEF. Only three patients (two in treatment A) experienced congestive heart failure.
Conclusion:
This trial shows that treatment A can be administered for repeated cycles without bone marrow support with increased, though acceptable, toxicity and with a significant increase of antitumor effect (especially in visceral and/or high‐burden disease), but no increased survival.",spin,"Imagine doctors are testing a new medicine (Treatment A) for breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.  They compared it to a standard treatment (Comparator B).

They gave the medicine to 456 people with the cancer, dividing them into two groups.  Both groups also got other medicines (5-FU and cyclophosphamide) along with Treatment A or Comparator B.

The results showed that Treatment A worked better at shrinking the tumors in the patients.  More people treated with Treatment A had their tumors shrink (57% vs. 41%).  This was especially true for people whose cancer had spread to their organs inside the body (like the stomach or intestines) or to many different parts of their body.

The new medicine also seemed to slow the cancer's growth a bit, but it didn't make people live longer overall.

The side effects were different between the two groups.  Treatment A caused more serious side effects like low blood cell counts (which can lead to infections) in a higher percentage of patients.  However, the number of deaths from infections was similar in both groups.  Both treatments had similar heart problems.

So, the new medicine (Treatment A) is better at shrinking the cancer, but it has more serious side effects, and it doesn't help people live longer.  Doctors need to carefully consider the risks and benefits when deciding if this medicine is right for someone.
