We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.\nMethods:\nWe randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30\u201070 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two\u2010sided.\nResults:\n2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66\u20101.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64\u20101.09; P = .177) between the two arms. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs (38 in the treatment A arm versus 40 in the control arm), incidence of distant metastasis (HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.79\u20101.22; P = .858), and all\u2010cause mortality (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.92\u20101.48; P = .215).\nConclusion:\nTreatment A was not more effective than no treatment in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.",

One group got chemotherapy alone, and the other group got chemotherapy plus Treatment A.  They tracked how long the people lived and how long their cancer stayed under control.\n\nThe results?  There wasn't much difference.  People who got chemotherapy plus Treatment A lived about the same amount of time (around 29 months) as people who got chemotherapy alone (around 30 months).  The time it took for the cancer to come back was also similar.  Even the success rate of shrinking the cancer (complete or partial response) was almost the same.  The only thing that was different was that there were more deaths from infections in the group that got Treatment A.\n\nSo, the study showed that Treatment A didn't really help more than just chemotherapy alone.  It wasn't better, and it might have even been slightly worse in terms of infections.\n",

In responding patients, median DOR (from randomization to progression) was 19.0 months for treatment A and 10.8 months for comparator B. Using all patients, DOR was significantly greater for treatment A compared with comparator B; the ratio of average response durations was 1.35 (95% CI, 1.10 to 1.67; P < 0.01). Both treatments were well tolerated.\nConclusion:\nTreatment A was at least as effective as comparator B, with efficacy end points slightly favoring treatment A. Treatment A represents an additional treatment option for postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer whose disease progresses on tamoxifen therapy.",

Patients in Arm A received treatment A, with concomitant radiotherapy (50 Gy +/\u2010 10\u201020\u2010Gy boost). Patients in Arm B received comparator B, with subsequent radiotherapy. The primary outcome was disease free survival.\nResults:\n650 women were enrolled in this trial, and a total of 638 patients were treated. Median treatment durations were 64 and 126 days (Arms A and B, respectively). Five\u2010year DFS in Arm A was 83% and in Arm B 79%, p = 0.22. Disease\u2010specific survival at 5 years was not statistically significantly different between Arm A and Arm B. Sixty\u2010eight patients died 34 in each group. There was no statistically significant difference at 5 years for regional or metastatic relapses. Local recurrences at 5 years was 3% in Arm A and 7% in Arm B, p=0.047). Febrile neutropenia (n=10 in arm A vs. n=1 in arm B) and Grade 3\u20104 leukopenia (n=43 vs n=4) were statistically significantly more frequent in Arm A. Subclinical left ventricular ejection fraction events at 1 year were more frequent with treatment A (p=0.02).\nConclusion:\nTreatment A was not more effective than comparator B in node\u2010positive, operable breast cancer patients.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:\nTreatment A is effective against HER\u20102\u2010positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy of treatment A in HER\u20102\u2010negative and HER\u20102\u2010uncharacterized MBC.\nPatients and methods:\nWomen with MBC were randomly assigned to first\u2010line therapy with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks plus treatment A or placebo. A preplanned retrospective evaluation of HER\u20102 status was performed using fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP); secondary end points were objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), event\u2010free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS).\nResults:\nIn the intent\u2010to\u2010treat population (n = 579), there were no significant differences in TTP, EFS, or OS between treatment arms, although differences in ORR and CBR were noted. In 86 HER\u20102\u2010positive patients (15%), treatment with paclitaxel\u2010 treatment A resulted in statistically significant improvements in TTP, EFS, ORR, and CBR compared with paclitaxel\u2010placebo. No differences between treatment groups were observed for any end point in HER\u20102\u2010negative patients. The most common adverse events were alopecia, rash, and diarrhea. The incidence of diarrhea and rash was significantly higher in the paclitaxel\u2010treatment A arm. The rate of cardiac events was low, and no difference was observed between treatment arms.\nConclusion:\nPatients with HER\u20102\u2010negative or HER\u20102\u2010untested MBC did not benefit from the addition of treatment A to paclitaxel. However, first\u2010line therapy with paclitaxel\u2010 treatment A significantly improved clinical outcomes in HER\u20102\u2010positive patients. Prospective evaluation of the efficacy and safety of this combination is ongoing in early and metastatic HER\u20102\u2010positive breast cancer patients.",

NCTXXXXX). Patients' characteristics were similar in both arms. Treatment A improved severity and duration of leukopenia. Three\u2010 year OS were similar (25.6 +/\u2010 5.1% vs. 31.8 +/\u2010 5.6%) in both arms except for patients with myeloblastic features. Significant factors for better survival were the use of treatment A (p = 0.049), female sex (p = 0.05) and single induction cycle (p < 0.001) in multivariate analysis. Female patients performed better than male patients. Better survival obtained among female AML patients needs to be validated within the context of cytogenetic analysis.",

They looked at a bunch of kids getting the standard treatment, and another group getting the standard treatment *plus* Treatment A.  The kids in both groups were pretty much the same.\n\nThe study found that Treatment A helped the kids' blood counts get better and stay better longer.  But, overall, the medicine didn't really change how long the kids lived.  The survival rate was about the same for both groups (25% to 32% after 3 years).\n\nHowever, there was one important difference:  Girls who got Treatment A did better than boys.  Also, kids who only needed one round of the standard treatment did better.  The study also found that using Treatment A itself was a good thing for survival.\n\nThe doctors need to do more studies to see if the girls did better because of their sex, or if there's something else going on with their blood cancer.  They need to look at the cancer's chromosomes to see if that plays a role.\n",

        "abstract": "Purpose:\nWe examined the value of treatment A in a phase III trial with strict preoperative staging and surgical resection guidelines.\nPatients and methods:\nPatients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagogastric junction (AEG II and III) were randomly assigned to treatment A followed by surgery or to surgery alone. To detect with 80% power an improvement in median survival from 17 months with surgery alone to 24 months with treatment A, 282 events were required.\nResults:\nThis trial was stopped for poor accrual after 144 patients were randomly assigned (72:72); 52.8% patients had tumors located in the proximal third of the stomach, including AEG type II and III. The International Union against Cancer R0 resection rate was 81.9% after treatment A as compared with 66.7% with surgery alone (P = .036). The surgery\u2010only group had more lymph node metastases than the treatment A group (76.5% v 61.4%; P = .018). Postoperative complications were more frequent in the treatment A arm (27.1% v 16.2%; P = .09). After a median follow\u2010up of 4.4 years and 67 deaths, a survival benefit could not be shown (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.35; P = .466).\nConclusion:\nThis trial showed a significantly increased R0 resection rate but failed to demonstrate a survival benefit. Possible explanations are low statistical power, a high rate of proximal gastric cancer including AEG and/or a better outcome than expected after radical surgery alone due to the high quality of surgery with resections of regional lymph nodes outside the perigastic area (celiac trunc, hepatic ligament, lymph node at a. lienalis; D2).",

A supplemental, exploratory analysis revealed that several fatigue end points, as measured by the BFI and POMS, were significantly better for those taking treatment A over placebo. Participants also reported less trouble with sleep and less drowsiness on treatment A than placebo. There were no significant differences in toxicities as measured by self\u2010report or the CTCAE except for mild alkaline phosphatase increases, which were slightly more common in the placebo group. This study failed to provide data to support the hypothesis that treatment A, at bedtime could improve sleep as measured by the PSQI.

        "abstract": "Background:\nTreatment A, has activity alone and in combination with docetaxel (Taxotere) and prednisone (DP) in metastatic castration\u2010resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). A randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled phase II trial compared DP combined with either treatment A (A) or placebo in chemonaive mCRPC.\nPatients and methods:\nMen with progressive mCRPC despite androgen deprivation were eligible and randomized 1:1. Patients received docetaxel (75 mg/m2 day 1) and prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily every 21 days with either treatment A or placebo twice daily orally on days 1\u20103. The primary end point was overall survival (OS).\nResults:\nTwo hundred and twenty\u2010one patients were randomly assigned. Median OS for treatment A plus docetaxel\u2010prednisone (ADP) and placebo\u2010DP was 18.1 versus 17.8 months [hazard ratio (HR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.72\u20101.55, P=0.63]. Secondary end points were also not statistically different. Grade 3/4 toxic effects for ADP versus placebo\u2010DP were cardiac events (5% versus 2%), lymphopenia (23% versus 16%), neutropenia (47% versus 40%), ileus (2% versus 0%) and pulmonary embolism (6% versus 2%). In a subgroup of high\u2010risk mCRPC (n=34), outcomes appeared to favor ADP (median OS 19 versus 14 months).\nConclusion:\nTreatment A was tolerable but did not extend OS when combined with DP in mCRPC; a potential benefit was observed in high\u2010risk patients.",

This cancer is already bad and not responding to other treatments.\n\nThey gave some men the new medicine (Treatment A) with other medicines (docetaxel and prednisone) and some men got a fake medicine (placebo) with the same other medicines.  They tracked how long each group of men lived.\n\nThe results?  The new medicine didn't seem to help the men live longer overall.  The men who got the new medicine and the other medicines lived about the same amount of time as the men who got the fake medicine and the other medicines (18.1 months vs 17.8 months).\n\nHowever, the new medicine *might* help men with the *worst* kind of cancer (the high-risk group).  It seemed like they lived a little longer.\n\nThe new medicine was safe to take, but some men had side effects like heart problems, low blood cell counts, or bowel problems, more often with the new medicine.\n",

        "abstract": "Purpose:\nA phase III study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) to evaluate the effect on response rate and survival of a treatment A.\nPatients and methods:\nFour hundred fifty\u2010six patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B in combination with 5\u2010FU (500 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) i.v., every 21 days for a maximum of six cycles (eight in case of CR).\nResults:\nOf 456 patients, 390 were evaluable for efficacy. Objective response (CR + PR) was seen in 57% (treatment A) vs. 41% (comparator B) of the evaluable patients (P = 0.003). The CR rate was higher in the treatment A arm (12% vs. 7%, P = 0.07). Treatment A produced significantly higher response rates in patients with visceral localization (50% vs. 34%, P = 0.011) and in patients with more than two metastatic organ sites (64% vs. 37%, P = 0.001). Median time to progression (7.6 vs. 7 months) and overall survival (18 months vs. 17 months) were similar. Myelosuppression was the principal toxic effect, with grade IV neutropenia observed in 57% of the patients treated with treatment A vs. 9% of those on comparator B. Grade IV infection or febrile neutropenia were observed in 8% (treatment A) vs. 0.4% (comparator B), but the incidence of septic death was the same in the two arms (two patients each). Cardiac toxicity was similar in the two treatment groups, with 5% vs. 3% of the patients taken off study due to cardiac events, primarily due to a decline in LVEF. Only three patients (two in treatment A) experienced congestive heart failure.\nConclusion:\nThis trial shows that treatment A can be administered for repeated cycles without bone marrow support with increased, though acceptable, toxicity and with a significant increase of antitumor effect (especially in visceral and/or high\u2010burden disease), but no increased survival.",

They compared it to a standard treatment (Comparator B).\n\nThey gave the medicine to 456 people with the cancer, dividing them into two groups.  Both groups also got other medicines (5-FU and cyclophosphamide) along with Treatment A or Comparator B.\n\nThe results showed that Treatment A worked better at shrinking the tumors in the patients.  More people treated with Treatment A had their tumors shrink (57% vs. 41%).  This was especially true for people whose cancer had spread to their organs inside the body (like the stomach or intestines) or to many different parts of their body.\n\nThe new medicine also seemed to slow the cancer's growth a bit, but it didn't make people live longer overall.\n\nThe side effects were different between the two groups.  Treatment A caused more serious side effects like low blood cell counts (which can lead to infections) in a higher percentage of patients.  However, the number of deaths from infections was similar in both groups.  Both treatments had similar heart problems.\n\nSo, the new medicine (Treatment A) is better at shrinking the cancer, but it has more serious side effects, and it doesn't help people live longer.  Doctors need to carefully consider the risks and benefits when deciding if this medicine is right for someone.\n",
