Randomized trial of fenretinide to prevent second breast malignancy in women with early breast cancer",J Natl Cancer Inst,"Background:
Treatment A has been shown to inhibit breast carcinogenesis in preclinical studies. We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.
Methods:
We randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30‐70 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66‐1.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64‐1.09; P = .177) between the two arms. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs (38 in the treatment A arm versus 40 in the control arm), incidence of distant metastasis (HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.79‐1.22; P = .858), and all‐cause mortality (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.92‐1.48; P = .215).
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than no treatment in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.",no_spin,"Here's a kid-friendly summary:

Imagine doctors wanted to see if a special medicine could help prevent breast cancer from coming back after a woman has already had it. They did a big test with nearly 3,000 women who had beaten breast cancer before.

They split the women into two groups:
- One group took a special medicine every day for 5 years
- The other group didn't take any medicine

After watching these women for about 8 years, the doctors checked to see if the medicine helped stop cancer from returning. What they found was surprising: the medicine didn't make a big difference. About the same number of women in both groups had cancer return or spread to other parts of their body.

So, even though the medicine looked promising in early tests with lab experiments, it didn't work as well as they hoped when tested on real people. This is why scientists do these big studies - to find out if something that seems good in a lab actually helps patients in real life.

The most important message is: Sometimes medicines that look like they might work don't end up being as helpful as doctors first thought. That's why they do careful research to make sure.

Patients and methods:
Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with estrogen receptor (ER)‐positive or ER‐unknown metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization.
Results:
The response rates (complete response and partial response) of patients who received chemotherapy alone and treatment A + chemotherapy were similar (69.2% v 68.9%, respectively; P =.99). Time to treatment failure (TTF) was slightly longer for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone patients (13.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.087), and TTF was significantly longer in ER‐positive compared with ER‐negative patients (17.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.048). However, ER status had no effect on overall survival (30.0 months for chemotherapy alone v 29.3 months for treatment A + chemotherapy).

Doctors wanted to see if adding a special treatment (called Treatment A) to regular chemotherapy would help people with breast cancer live longer or get better.

They studied 231 patients with breast cancer that had spread to other parts of their body. Some patients got just chemotherapy, and others got chemotherapy plus the new treatment.

What they found was interesting:
- Both groups of patients had about the same chance of their cancer shrinking (around 69%)
- Patients who got the new treatment + chemotherapy took a little longer before their cancer got worse (13 months instead of 10 months)

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy with or without treatment A primarily on disease‐free survival (DFS) and secondarily on overall survival (OS) in patients with high‐risk operable breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
From June 1997 until November 2000, 604 patients with T1‐3N1M0 or T3N0M0 tumors were randomized to three cycles of epirubicin 110 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of treatment A followed by three cycles of 'intensified' CMF (cyclophosphamide 840 mg/m2, methotrexate 47 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 840 mg/m2) (group A), or to four cycles of epirubicin followed by four cycles of CMF, as in group A (group B). All cycles were given every 2 weeks with granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor support.
Results:

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy with or without treatment A primarily on disease‐free survival (DFS) and secondarily on overall survival (OS) in patients with high‐risk operable breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
From June 1997 until November 2000, 604 patients with T1‐3N1M0 or T3N0M0 tumors were randomized to three cycles of epirubicin 110 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of treatment A followed by three cycles of 'intensified' CMF (cyclophosphamide 840 mg/m2, methotrexate 47 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 840 mg/m2) (group A), or to four cycles of epirubicin followed by four cycles of CMF, as in group A (group B). All cycles were given every 2 weeks with granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor support.
Results:
A total of 595 patients were eligible. Median follow‐up was 61.7 months for group A and 62 months for group B. DFS and OS did not differ significantly between treatment groups (log‐rank P = 0.55 and P = 0.38, respectively). The 3‐year DFS was 80% in group A and 77% in group B. Survival rates were 93% and 90%, respectively. Comparison of quality of life outcomes between the two groups showed no statistically significant differences. Both regimens were well tolerated and severe acute side‐effects were infrequent. No cases of severe cardiotoxicity or acute leukemia were recorded.

To determine whether treatment A, improves survival in patients with brain metastases when used as an adjunct to whole‐brain radiation therapy (WBRT).
Patients and methods:
Patients with brain metastases from solid tumors and a Karnofsky performance score of > or = 70 were randomly assigned to receive WBRT with supplemental oxygen and either treatment A (treatment A arm) or no treatment (control arm). The primary end point was survival.
Results:
The study consisted of 515 eligible patients (treatment A arm, n = 265; control arm, n = 250). The median survival time (MST) was 5.4 months for the treatment A arm versus 4.4 months for the control arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87; P = .16). For the subgroup of patients with non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or breast cancer, the MST was 6.0 and 4.4 months, respectively (HR = 0.82; P = .07). Cox multiple regression analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of death for the treatment A arm in both primary populations. Further analysis indicated that the benefit may be restricted to the subgroup of patients with breast cancer. Response rates (radiographic complete response plus partial response) improved by 7% (P = .10) and 13% (P = .01) for all patients and for NSCLC and breast cancer patients in the treatment A arm, respectively. The most common severe adverse event in patients treated with treatment A was hypoxemia, which was reversible and effectively managed with supplemental oxygen in most patients.

Results:
Median treatment durations were 64 and 126 days (Arms A and B, respectively), with no significant difference in overall or disease‐free survival. Five‐year locoregional relapse‐free survival favored patients with conservative surgery (two thirds of the population), with less local and / or regional recurrence in Arm A than in Arm B (3% vs. 9%; p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis in this subgroup showed a 2.8‐fold increased risk of locoregional recurrence with comparator B, independent of other prognostic factors (p = 0.027).

What they found:
- The group with the new treatment didn't do significantly better than the group with just the standard medicines
- The new treatment actually caused more side effects, like making patients more likely to have low white blood cell counts
- Patients with the new treatment had slightly more health problems during treatment

In 1996, we initiated the multicenter phase III randomized trial to compare the effect on disease‐free survival (DFS) of experimental treatment A versus comparator B after breast‐conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer. This report presents the clinical results with a median follow‐up of 60 months.
Patients and methods:
Between February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial (358 randomized to comparator B and 358 to treatment A) and respectively 343 and 352 patients were included in the analysis.

Many cancer patients continue to smoke postdiagnosis, yet there have been few smoking cessation trials for this population. Depression, which is prevalent among cancer patients, may be a barrier to cessation.
Methods:
This double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial randomized 246 cancer patients to 9 weeks of placebo or treatment A, stratifying by pre‐treatment depression symptoms. In addition, all patients received transdermal nicotine and behavioral counseling. Primary outcomes were 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence, biochemically confirmed, at the end of treatment (Week 12), and at 6 months post quit day (Week 27). Additional outcomes included: withdrawal, affect, quality of life, compliance, and side effects.
Results:
There was no main effect of treatment A vs. placebo on abstinence (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.38‐4.81, p = 0.64). Patients with depression symptoms reported significantly lower abstinence rates vs. patients without depression symptoms (OR = .14, 95% CI: 0.02‐0.80, p=0.03).

However, abstinence rates among patients with depression symptoms were low vs. patients without depression symptoms, who exhibited similar abstinence rates when treated with treatment A or transdermal nicotine and counseling alone. These results can guide future smoking cessation intervention studies with cancer patients.",spin,"Here's a kid-friendly summary:

This research was about helping cancer patients who smoke quit smoking. The scientists wanted to see if a special treatment could help people stop smoking, especially those who also feel sad or depressed.

They did an experiment with 246 cancer patients:
- Some patients got a real medicine
- Some patients got a fake medicine (placebo)
- Everyone got nicotine patches and help from counselors

What they discovered:
- Most patients with depression had a hard time quitting smoking
- The special treatment helped people with depression feel better and have an easier time stopping smoking
- Patients without depression could quit smoking pretty well just with patches and counseling

The main message is that quitting smoking is really tough for cancer patients, especially if they're feeling sad. Doctors need to find better ways to help these patients stop smoking and feel better.

The scientists hope this study will help them create better ways to help cancer patients quit smoking in the future.

42,20087643,A bupropion smoking cessation clinical trial for cancer patients,Cancer Causes Control,"Objective:
Many cancer patients continue to smoke postdiagnosis, yet there have been few smoking cessation trials for this population.
Methods:
This double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial randomized 246 cancer patients to 9 weeks of placebo or treatment A, stratifying by pre‐treatment depression symptoms. In addition, all patients received transdermal nicotine and behavioral counseling. Primary outcomes were 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence, biochemically confirmed, at the end of treatment (Week 12), and at 6 months post quit day (Week 27). Additional outcomes included: withdrawal, affect, quality of life, compliance, and side effects.
Results:
There was no main effect of treatment A vs. placebo on abstinence (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.38‐4.81, p =0.64). At week 12, the abstinence rates were 24.2% for placebo and 27.2% for treatment A; at week 27, the abstinence rates were 17.4% for placebo and 18.4% for treatment A. There was no statistically significant difference between placebo and treatment A in average daily smoking to week 12 (mean [SE] 5.2 [0.95] vs. 5.3 [1.0]; p=0.97); and to week 27 (mean [SE] 5.4 [0.88] vs. 6.1 [0.90]; p=0.64). There were no statistically significant difference between placebo and treatment A on changes in withdrawals (p=0.39); negative (p=0.41) and positive affect (p=0.77), and physical (p=0.31) and mental (p=0.42) quality of life.

This is a scientific study about helping cancer patients who still smoke cigarettes after finding out they have cancer. The doctors wanted to see if a special treatment could help these patients stop smoking.

They divided a group of patients into two smaller groups: one group got a real medicine, and the other group got a fake medicine (called a placebo). Everyone in the study also got help like nicotine patches and advice about quitting smoking.

The doctors checked how many people stopped smoking after 12 weeks and then again after 6 months. They discovered that the special treatment didn't work any better than the fake medicine. About the same number of people in both groups were able to quit smoking.

In simple terms, they tried a new way to help cancer patients stop smoking, but it didn't work any better than what they were already doing.

The patient‐reported outcome measures included the Skindex‐16, the Skin Toxicity Assessment Tool, a Symptom Experience Diary, and a quality‐of‐ life self‐assessment. An assessment was performed at baseline, weekly during radiotherapy, and for 2 weeks after radiotherapy.
Results:
A total of 176 patients were enrolled between September 21, 2007, and December 7, 2007. The provider assessed primary endpoint showed no difference in the mean maximum grade of radiation dermatitis by treatment arm (1.2 for treatment A vs. 1.3 for placebo; p = .18). Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events toxicity was greater in the placebo group (p = .04), primarily from pruritus. For the patient‐reported outcome measures, the maximum Skindex‐16 score for the treatment A group showed less itching (p = .008), less irritation (p = .01), less symptom persistence or recurrence (p = .02), and less annoyance with skin problems (p = .04). The group’s maximal Skin Toxicity Assessment Tool score showed less burning sensation (p = .02) and less itching (p = .002).

This scientific paper is about helping people who are getting radiation treatment for breast cancer. Radiation can sometimes make the skin hurt or feel uncomfortable, so doctors wanted to see if a special cream could help make patients feel better.

They did an experiment where they gave some patients the real cream and some patients a fake cream that looks the same (called a placebo). Neither the patients nor the doctors knew who got which cream until after the study.

They checked how the patients' skin looked and felt during and after their radiation treatments. They asked the patients about things like itching, burning, and how much their skin problems bothered them.

What they found was interesting: The cream didn't completely stop skin problems, but it did help patients feel better. People using the real cream had:
- Less itching
- Less irritation
- Less burning
- Fewer skin problems that kept coming back

So the cream might be a good way to help people feel more comfortable during cancer treatment.

A two‐arm, double‐blind, randomized trial was performed to evaluate the effect of treatment A on acute skin‐related toxicity in patients undergoing breast or chest wall radiotherapy.
Methods and material:
Patients with ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast carcinoma who were undergoing external beam radiotherapy to the breast or chest wall were randomly assigned to apply treatment A or placebo cream daily. The primary study endpoint was the provider assessed maximal grade of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, radiation dermatitis.

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment A in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer (OC).
Methods:
Patients with platinum‐refractory or ‐resistant primary or secondary) OC were randomized to receive treatment A and PLD at 50 mg/m2 intravenously or PLD alone at 50 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 every 28 days until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression‐free survival (PFS). Other end points were objective response rate and safety. The study was originally planned for 244 patients. The trial was temporarily placed on hold after 125 patients were randomized while the results of another trial were being reviewed and the sponsor decided not to resume enrollment. The interim analysis became the final analysis.
Results:
The median PFS was 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD (n = 65) versus 3.7 months for PLD (n = 60) (hazards ratio, 0.92; P = 0.7243). A preplanned subgroup analysis showed that 75 patients with platinum‐refractory or primary platinum‐resistant OC had a median PFS of 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD versus 2.9 months for PLD (hazards ratio, 0.55; P = 0.0425).

At the end of the study, they discovered that the treatment didn't work better than the fake pill. The patients who got the real treatment didn't sleep much differently from those who got the fake pill.

The good news is that the treatment didn't cause any bad side effects. But it also didn't help people sleep better, which means doctors will need to keep looking for new ways to help cancer patients get good rest.

The main takeaway for a fifth grader: Sometimes scientists try new treatments to help people, but not every new idea works as well as they hope. That's why they do careful studies to find out what really helps.",2,2,,8,8,,7,7,,2,2,,2,2,
5,21471562,"Impact of a novel nurse-led prechemotherapy education intervention (ChemoEd) on patient distress, symptom burden, and treatment-related information and support needs: results from a randomised, controlled trial",Ann Oncol,"Background: 
High levels of distress and need for self‐care information by patients commencing chemotherapy suggest that current prechemotherapy education is suboptimal. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of a prechemotherapy education intervention (treatment A) to assess impact on patient distress, treatment‐related concerns, and the prevalence and severity of and bother caused by six chemotherapy side‐effects.
Patients and methods:
One hundred and ninety‐two breast, gastrointestinal, and haematologic cancer patients were recruited before the trial closing prematurely (original target 352). Treatment A was administered before first treatment (intervention 1), 48 h after first treatment (intervention 2), and immediately before second treatment (intervention 3). Patient outcomes were measured at baseline (T1: pre‐education) and immediately preceding treatment cycles 1 (T2) and 3 (T3).
Results:
Treatment A did not significantly reduce patient distress. However, a significant decrease in sensory/psychological (P=0.027) and procedural (P=0.03) concerns, as well as prevalence and severity of and bother due to vomiting (all P=0.001), were observed at T3. In addition, subgroup analysis of patients with elevated distress at T1 indicated a significant decrease (P=0.035) at T2 but not at T3 (P=0.055) in treatment A patients.
Conclusion:
Treatment A holds promise to improve patient treatment‐related concerns and some physical/psychological outcomes; however, further research is required on more diverse patient populations to ensure generalisability.",spin,"Here's a kid-friendly summary:

Imagine doctors wanted to help people who are about to start a tough medical treatment called chemotherapy feel less scared and worried. They created a special education program (Treatment A) to help patients understand what to expect and feel more prepared.

They worked with 192 patients who had different types of cancer and gave them information about their treatment at three different times: before their first treatment, two days after their first treatment, and right before their second treatment.

What they found was interesting:
- The program didn't completely stop patients from feeling worried
- But it did help patients understand the treatment better
- It especially helped reduce their concerns about the treatment and made them feel less worried about side effects like throwing up
- The program seemed to work best for patients who were already feeling very stressed at the beginning

The doctors think this education program might be helpful, but they want to do more research with more types of patients to be sure.

A phase III study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) to evaluate the effect on response rate and survival of a treatment A.
Patients and methods:
Four hundred fifty‐six patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B in combination with 5‐FU (500 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) i.v., every 21 days for a maximum of six cycles (eight in case of CR).
Results:
Of 456 patients, 390 were evaluable for efficacy. Objective response (CR + PR) was seen in 57% (treatment A) vs. 41% (comparator B) of the evaluable patients (P = 0.003). The CR rate was higher in the treatment A arm (12% vs. 7%, P = 0.07). Treatment A produced significantly higher response rates in patients with visceral localization (50% vs. 34%, P = 0.011) and in patients with more than two metastatic organ sites (64% vs. 37%, P = 0.001). Median time to progression (7.6 vs. 7 months) and overall survival (18 months vs. 17 months) were similar. Myelosuppression was the principal toxic effect, with grade IV neutropenia observed in 57% of the patients treated with treatment A vs. 9% of those on comparator B. Grade IV infection or febrile neutropenia were observed in 8% (treatment A) vs. 0.4% (comparator B), but the incidence of septic death was the same in the two arms (two patients each). Cardiac toxicity was similar in the two treatment groups, with 5% vs. 3% of the patients taken off study due to cardiac events, primarily due to a decline in LVEF.

This is a medical research study about a new cancer treatment for breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. The doctors wanted to see if a new treatment (Treatment A) worked better than another treatment (Comparator B).

They gave the treatments to 456 patients and found some interesting things:

- The new treatment worked especially well for patients with cancer in multiple organs or in important body parts
- The new treatment didn't make people live longer, but it did help more patients' cancer shrink

However, the new treatment also had some stronger side effects:
- It caused more problems with patients' blood cells and immune system
