        "abstract": "Background:\nTreatment A has been shown to inhibit breast carcinogenesis in preclinical studies. We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.\nMethods:\nWe randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30\u201070 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two\u2010sided.\nResults:\n2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66\u20101.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64\u20101.09; P = .177) between the two arms. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs (38 in the treatment A arm versus 40 in the control arm), incidence of distant metastasis (HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.79\u20101.22; P = .858), and all\u2010cause mortality (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.92\u20101.48; P = .215).\nConclusion:\nTreatment A was not more effective than no treatment in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.",

        "plain_language_summary": "Here's a kid-friendly summary:\n\nImagine doctors wanted to see if a special medicine could help prevent breast cancer from coming back after a woman has already had it. They did a big test with nearly 3,000 women who had beaten breast cancer before.\n\nThey split the women into two groups:\n- One group took a special medicine every day for 5 years\n- The other group didn't take any medicine\n\nAfter watching these women for about 8 years, the doctors checked to see if the medicine helped stop cancer from returning. What they found was surprising: the medicine didn't make a big difference. About the same number of women in both groups had cancer return or spread to other parts of their body.\n\nSo, even though the medicine looked promising in early tests with lab experiments, it didn't work as well as they hoped when tested on real people. This is why scientists do these big studies - to find out if something that seems good in a lab actually helps patients in real life.\n\nThe most important message is: Sometimes medicines that look like they might work don't end up being as helpful as doctors first thought. That's why they do careful research to make sure.\n\nWould you like me to explain any part of this in a different way?",

Secondary end points included objective response (OR) rate, duration of response (DOR), and tolerability.\nResults:\nPatients (n = 400) were followed for a median period of 16.8 months. Treatment A was as effective as comparator B in terms of TTP (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 1.14; P =.43); median TTP was 5.4 months with treatment A and 3.4 months with comparator B. OR rates were 17.5% with both treatments. Clinical benefit rates (complete response + partial response + stable disease > or = 24 weeks) were 42.2% for treatment A and 36.1% for comparator B (95% CI, \u20104.00% to 16.41%; P =.26). In responding patients, median DOR (from randomization to progression) was 19.0 months for treatment A and 10.8 months for comparator B. Using all patients, DOR was significantly greater for treatment A compared with comparator B; the ratio of average response durations was 1.35 (95% CI, 1.10 to 1.67; P < 0.01). Both treatments were well tolerated.\nConclusion:\nTreatment A was at least as effective as comparator B, with efficacy end points slightly favoring treatment A. Treatment A represents an additional treatment option for postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer whose disease progresses on tamoxifen therapy.",

The addition of treatment A to epirubicin chemotherapy did not improve the response rate but led to a significantly higher reduction in the Ki67 expression.

        "abstract": "Purpose:\nTo evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of treatment A plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) therapy in comparison with CAF + placebo, in patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer.\nMethods and materials:\nIn this randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled trial, patients were treated with six cycles of CAF therapy: 28 days/cycle, with doxorubicin (25 mg/m2) and fluorouracil (500 mg/m2) administered on days 1 and 8 and cyclophosphamide (100 mg orally [PO]) administered on day 1 through 14. Primary end point was overall response rate (ORR; partial or complete response). In total, 221 patients were assessable.\nResults:\nA total of 227 patients were recruited, the full analysis set consisted of 221 patients. ORR was 42.6% (95% confidence interval (CI), 33.1 to 52.5) for CAF + placebo compared with 53.1% (95% CI, 43.5 to 62.5) for treatment A + CAF (P = .077).

Treatment was not masked. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Treatment groups were compared with a non\u2010stratified log\u2010 rank test. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN XXXX.\nFindings:\n502 patients were randomly assigned to receive comparator B and 504 to receive combined treatment A.

        "journal": "Lancet",
        "abstract": "Background:\nWe aimed to compare overall survival in patients receiving treatment A or comparator B.\nMethods:\nThis was an open\u2010label randomized trial undertaken in 50 centres across eight countries. 1006 treatment\u2010naive patients diagnosed with advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma were randomly allocated (1 to 1) by minimization to receive comparator B or treatment A. Treatment was not masked. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Treatment groups were compared with a non\u2010stratified log\u2010 rank test. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN XXXX.\nFindings:\n502 patients were randomly assigned to receive comparator B and 504 to receive combined treatment A. Median follow\u2010up was 37.2 months (24.8\u201052.3). Median overall survival was 18.8 months (17.0\u201023.2) for patients receiving comparator B versus 18.6 months (16.5\u201020.6) for those receiving treatment A. Overall survival did not differ between the two groups (hazard ratio 1.05 [95% CI 0.90\u20101.21], p=0.55; absolute difference 0.3% (\u20105.1 to 5.6) at 1 year and 2.7% (\u20108.2 to 2.9) at 3 years). Serious adverse events were reported in 113 (23%) patients receiving comparator B and 131 (26%) of those receiving combined treatment A.\nInterpretation:\nAlthough treatment A does not improve overall or progression\u2010free survival compared with comparator B, treatment A might still have a role because it can produce remissions that are of clinically relevant length in some patients. Identification of patients who will benefit from treatment A is crucial.",

What they found was interesting:\n- Patients in both groups lived almost the same amount of time (around 18-19 months)\n- The new treatment (A) wasn't better or worse than the old treatment (B)\n- A few more people in the treatment A group had serious side effects\n\nThe doctors concluded that while treatment A didn't help people live longer, it might still be helpful for some patients. They think it's important to figure out which specific patients might benefit from this new treatment.\n\nIt's like trying two different strategies in a video game - sometimes one isn't clearly better, but it might work really well for certain players.\n\nWould you like me to explain any part of this in more detail?",

        "journal": "J Clin Oncol",
        "abstract": "Purpose:\nThis phase III trial assesses whether treatment A increases the duration of functional independence after surgery or radiosurgery of brain metastases.\nPatients and methods:\nPatients with one to three brain metastases of solid tumors (small\u2010cell lung cancer excluded) with stable systemic disease or asymptomatic primary tumors and WHO performance status (PS) of 0 to 2 were treated with complete surgery or radiosurgery and randomly assigned to treatment A or observation (OBS). The primary end point was time to WHO PS deterioration to more than 2.\nResults:\nOf 359 patients, 199 underwent radiosurgery, and 160 underwent surgery. In the radiosurgery group, 100 patients were allocated to OBS, and 99 were allocated to treatment A. After surgery, 79 patients were allocated to OBS, and 81 were allocated to treatment A. The median time to WHO PS more than 2 was 10.0 months (95% CI, 8.1 to 11.7 months) after OBS and 9.5 months (95% CI, 7.8 to 11.9 months) after treatment A (P = .71). Overall survival was similar in the treatment A and OBS arms (median, 10.9 v 10.7 months, respectively; P = .89). Treatment A reduced the 2\u2010year relapse rate both at initial sites (surgery: 59% to 27%, P < .001; radiosurgery: 31% to 19%, P = .040) and at new sites (surgery: 42% to 23%, P = .008; radiosurgery: 48% to 33%, P = .023). Salvage therapies were used more frequently after OBS than after treatment A. Intracranial progression caused death in 78 (44%) of 179 patients in the OBS arm and in 50 (28%) of 180 patients in the treatment A arm.\nConclusion:\nAfter radiosurgery or surgery of a limited number of brain metastases, treatment A reduces intracranial relapses and neurologic deaths but fails to improve the duration of functional independence and overall survival.",

They wanted to see if a special treatment (Treatment A) could help patients stay healthy and independent longer after surgery to remove brain tumors.\n\nThey studied 359 patients with 1-3 brain tumors and split them into two groups: one group got the new treatment, and the other group just got regular care (observation). They tracked how long patients could take care of themselves and stay active.\n\nWhat they found was interesting:\n- The new treatment didn't help patients stay independent longer\n- Patients lived about the same amount of time whether they got the new treatment or not\n- BUT the new treatment was good at two things:\n  1. It stopped the cancer from coming back in the same spot\n  2. It reduced the number of patients who died from brain cancer spreading\n\nSo basically, the treatment didn't make people live longer, but it did help slow down the cancer's growth and stop it from spreading as quickly.\n\nThe doctors concluded that while the treatment wasn't a miracle cure, it could still be helpful in managing brain cancer.\n\nWould you like me to simplify this even more?",

Possible explanations are low statistical power, a high rate of proximal gastric cancer including AEG and/or a better outcome than expected after radical surgery alone due to the high quality of surgery with resections of regional lymph nodes outside the perigastic area (celiac trunc, hepatic ligament, lymph node at a. lienalis; D2).",

But they keep trying to make things better for patients.",
