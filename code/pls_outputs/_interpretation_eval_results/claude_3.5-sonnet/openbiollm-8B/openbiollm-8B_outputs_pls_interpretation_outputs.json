        "abstract": "Background:\nTreatment A has been shown to inhibit breast carcinogenesis in preclinical studies. We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.\nMethods:\nWe randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30\u201070 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two\u2010sided.\nResults:\n2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66\u20101.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64\u20101.09; P = .177) between the two arms. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs (38 in the treatment A arm versus 40 in the control arm), incidence of distant metastasis (HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.79\u20101.22; P = .858), and all\u2010cause mortality (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.92\u20101.48; P = .215).\nConclusion:\nTreatment A was not more effective than no treatment in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.",

Between January 1997 and January 2002, 211 consecutive patients with T2\u20104, N0\u20101, M0 breast cancer were randomized to receive either epirubicin alone (EPI) or epirubicin plus treatment A. Ki67 expression was evaluated immunohistochemically in tumor specimens obtained before chemotherapy by incision biopsy and at definitive surgery. Tumor shrinkage of >50% was obtained in 76% of patients randomized in the EPI arm and 81.9% of patients randomized in the EPI+treatment A arm (not significant). The corresponding rates of clinical and pathological complete response were 20.2 and 21.9% (not significant), and 4.8 and 6.7% (not significant), respectively. Pathologically complete response was more frequently observed in estrogen receptor (ER)\u2010negative (ER\u2010) tumors (P=0.04) and correlated with elevated baseline Ki67 expression (P<0.01). Both EPI treatment and EPI+treatment A resulted in a significant reduction in Ki67 expression, either in overall patients (P=0.000) or in patients with ER+ breast cancer (P=0.000). The reduction in Ki67 immunostaining in the EPI+treatment A arm was greater than in the EPI arm, leading to a lower Ki67 expression at post\u2010operative residual histology (P=0.0041). The addition of treatment A to epirubicin chemotherapy did not improve the response rate but led to a significantly higher reduction in the Ki67 expression. Baseline elevated Ki67 expression and the ER\u2010 statuses were both associated with a greater chance of obtaining a pathological complete response at residual histology.",

They looked at the tumors before and after treatment to see how they responded. They found that adding treatment A didn't make the chemotherapy more effective at shrinking the tumors or in getting the cancer to completely go away. However, it did help reduce a marker called Ki67, which shows how fast the cancer cells are growing. This reduction was more noticeable in tumors that were estrogen receptor negative and in patients who had higher levels of Ki67 before treatment. Overall, adding treatment A to chemotherapy didn't improve the response to treatment, but it did lead to a greater decrease in the Ki67 levels, which could be important for understanding how the cancer is growing.",

Disease\u2010specific survival at 5 years was not statistically significantly different between Arm A and Arm B. Sixty\u2010eight patients died 34 in each group. There was no statistically significant difference at 5 years for regional or metastatic relapses. Local recurrences at 5 years was 3% in Arm A and 7% in Arm B, p=0.047). Febrile neutropenia (n=10 in arm A vs. n=1 in arm B) and Grade 3\u20104 leukopenia (n=43 vs n=4) were statistically significantly more frequent in Arm A. Subclinical left ventricular ejection fraction events at 1 year were more frequent with treatment A (p=0.02).\nConclusion:\nTreatment A was not more effective than comparator B in node\u2010positive, operable breast cancer patients.",

The treatments were given to 638 women who had surgery for their breast cancer and had positive lymph nodes. The study found that treatment A did not work better than treatment B in improving disease-free survival or preventing death from the disease. However, treatment A did lead to more frequent side effects like febrile neutropenia and Grade 3-4 leukopenia compared to treatment B. Additionally, there were more cases of subclinical left ventricular ejection fraction events with treatment A. Overall, the study concluded that treatment B was just as good as treatment A for treating node-positive, operable breast cancer.",

This report presents the clinical results with a median follow\u2010up of 60 months.\nPatients and methods:\nBetween February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery.\nResults:\nThere was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5\u2010year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence\u2010free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis\u2010free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76). Nevertheless, in the node\u2010positive subgroup, the 5\u2010year LRFS was statistically better in the treatment A arm (97% in treatment A v 91% in comparator B; P = .02), corresponding to a risk of locoregional recurrence decreased by 39% (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.93).\nConclusion:\nThis treatment protocol remains an appealing clinical option for many women with operable breast cancer at a high risk of recurrence. Combination treatments with new drugs for breast cancer are warranted.",

The main goal was to see which treatment delayed the growth or spread of the cancer the most. The results showed that both treatments had similar effectiveness in delaying cancer progression, with treatment A having a median delay of 8.05 months and treatment B having a median delay of 7.98 months. The difference between the two treatments was not statistically significant, which means it could have been due to chance.  Both treatments also had similar overall response rates, meaning they both had about a 32% chance of causing the cancer to shrink. However, there were some differences in side effects. Treatment A had more cases of low white blood cell count, needing blood transfusions, and diarrhea compared to treatment B. Treatment B had more cases of mouth sores and hand-and-foot syndrome. About 13% of patients on treatment A and 27% of patients on treatment B stopped the treatment because of side effects. Overall, the study concluded that treatment A was not better than treatment B for patients with advanced breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:\nThis phase III study compared the efficacy and safety of treatment A with comparator B in advanced breast cancer.\nPatients and methods:\nPatients were randomly assigned to treatment A or comparator B. Comparison of progression\u2010free survival (PFS) was the primary objective.\nResults:\nPatient characteristics were balanced between arms (N = 305). Median PFS was 8.05 months (95% CI, 6.60 to 8.71) for treatment A and 7.98 (95% CI, 6.93 to 8.77) for comparator B (log\u2010rank P = .121). Overall response rate (ORR) was 32% in both arms, and overall survival (OS) was not different between arms (P = .983). Time to treatment failure (TTF; defined as discontinuation, progressive disease, death as a result of any cause, or the start of a new anticancer therapy) was superior in the treatment A arm (P = .059). Hematologic toxicity was similar in both arms, except for grades 3 to 4 leukopenia (treatment A, 78%; comparator B, 66%; P = .025) and transfusions (treatment A, 17%; comparator B, 7%; P = .0051). Grades 3 to 4 diarrhea, mucositis, and hand\u2010and\u2010foot syndrome were significantly higher in the comparator B arm. Fewer patients in the treatment A arm discontinued because of drug\u2010related adverse events (13% v 27% in CD; P = .002).\nConclusion:\nNo difference was observed between treatment A and comparator B arms in PFS, ORR, and OS. TTF was longer in the treatment A arm. These findings, combined with a nonhematologic toxicity profile that favors treatment A over approved doses of comparator B, suggest that treatment A may be a better option than comparator B in this clinical setting.",

        "plain_language_summary": "The study compared two treatments, A and B, for advanced breast cancer. Patients were randomly assigned to either treatment and the primary objective was to compare the time until the cancer progressed. The results showed that the time until progression was similar for both treatments, with an average of about 8 months for both. The overall response rate, which measures how many patients had a positive response to the treatment, was also similar at 32% for both treatments. The survival rate was also similar, with no significant difference between the two treatments. However, the time until treatment failure, which includes discontinuation of treatment due to any reason or progression of the cancer, was slightly better with treatment A. Both treatments had similar hematologic toxicities, which are side effects affecting the blood, but treatment A had more cases of leukopenia, a decrease in white blood cells, and the need for more blood transfusions. Treatment A also had fewer patients who stopped the treatment due to side effects compared to treatment B. In conclusion, the study found no significant difference in the effectiveness of treatment A and B in terms of preventing cancer progression or improving overall survival. However, treatment A may be a better option for some patients as it has a slightly longer time until treatment failure and fewer side effects.",

        "abstract": "Objective:\nTo evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment A in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in platinum\u2010resistant ovarian cancer (OC).\nMethods:\nPatients with platinum\u2010refractory or \u2010resistant primary or secondary) OC were randomized to receive treatment A and PLD at 50 mg/m2 intravenously or PLD alone at 50 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 every 28 days until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression\u2010free survival (PFS). Other end points were objective response rate and safety. The study was originally planned for 244 patients. The trial was temporarily placed on hold after 125 patients were randomized while the results of another trial were being reviewed and the sponsor decided not to resume enrollment. The interim analysis became the final analysis.\nResults:\nThe median PFS was 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD (n = 65) versus 3.7 months for PLD (n = 60) (hazards ratio, 0.92; P = 0.7243). A preplanned subgroup analysis showed that 75 patients with platinum\u2010refractory or primary platinum\u2010resistant OC had a median PFS of 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD versus 2.9 months for PLD (hazards ratio, 0.55; P = 0.0425). Hematologic adverse events were 66% on the treatment A + PLD arm versus 44% on the PLD arm, manageable with dose reductions. Nonhematologic adverse events were similar for both arms. The incidence of palmar\u2010plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis was lower on treatment A + PLD (23%, 31%, respectively) versus (39%, 49%, respectively) on PLD.\nConclusion:\nOverall median PFS showed a positive trend but was not statistically significant. The median PFS in the platinum\u2010refractory and primary platinum\u2010resistant OC patients was significantly longer for treatment A + PLD versus PLD. Treatment A may ameliorate the palmar\u2010plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis known to be associated with PLD.

The results showed that the combination treatment might slightly improve how long the cancer stays the same, but it was not statistically significant. In patients whose cancer had not responded to platinum-based chemotherapy, the combination treatment was better than PLD alone at keeping the cancer from getting worse.

        "journal": "J Support Oncol",
        "abstract": "Sleep disorders are a substantial problem for cancer survivors, with prevalence estimates ranging from 23% to 61%. Although numerous prescription hypnotics are available, few are approved for long\u2010term use or have demonstrated benefit in this circumstance. Hypnotics may have unwanted side effects and are costly, and cancer survivors often wish to avoid prescription drugs. New options with limited side effects are needed. The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of treatment A for sleep in people with cancer who were undergoing cancer treatment. Participants were randomized to receive treatment A or placebo orally 1 hour before bedtime for 8 weeks. The primary end point was area under the curve (AUC) of the overall Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Secondary outcomes included the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Toxicity was evaluated with both self\u2010reported numeric analogue scale questions and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0. Questionnaires were completed at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks. A total of 227 patients were randomized into this study between March 19, 2004, and March 9, 2007, with 119 being evaluable for the primary end point. The AUC over the 8 weeks for treatment A was 51.4 (SD = 16), while that for placebo was 49.7 (SD = 15), with a P value of 0.6957. A supplemental, exploratory analysis revealed that several fatigue end points, as measured by the BFI and POMS, were significantly better for those taking treatment A over placebo. Participants also reported less trouble with sleep and less drowsiness on treatment A than placebo. There were no significant differences in toxicities as measured by self\u2010report or the CTCAE except for mild alkaline phosphatase increases, which were slightly more common in the placebo group. This study failed to provide data to support the hypothesis that treatment A, at bedtime could improve sleep as measured by the PSQI. However, exploratory analyses revealed improvement in some secondary outcomes, such as fatigue. Further research with treatment A exploring physiologic effects in oncology symptom management may be warranted.",

They divided the participants into two groups, one group got treatment A and the other group got a fake pill. They took the treatment or fake pill before bed for 8 weeks. The main thing they looked at was a sleep quality index. They also looked at other things like how tired they felt and their mood. The results showed that there was no significant difference between the group that got treatment A and the group that got the fake pill in terms of improving sleep. However, they did find that some secondary outcomes, like fatigue, were better for those who took treatment A. It's possible that treatment A could be helpful for managing symptoms of fatigue in people with cancer, but it doesn't seem to directly improve sleep quality.",

        "abstract": "Sleep disorders are a substantial problem for cancer survivors, with prevalence estimates ranging from 23% to 61%. Although numerous prescription hypnotics are available, few are approved for long\u2010term use or have demonstrated benefit in this circumstance. Hypnotics may have unwanted side effects and are costly, and cancer survivors often wish to avoid prescription drugs. New options with limited side effects are needed. The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of a treatment A for sleep in people with cancer who were undergoing cancer treatment. Participants were randomized to receive treatment A or placebo orally 1 hour before bedtime for 8 weeks. The primary end point was area under the curve (AUC) of the overall Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Secondary outcomes included the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Toxicity was evaluated with both self\u2010reported numeric analogue scale questions and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0. Questionnaires were completed at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks. A total of 227 patients were randomized into this study between March 19, 2004, and March 9, 2007. Twenty\u2010three patients withdrew before starting the study treatment. Primary end\u2010point data were available on 119 patients (62 receiving treatment A and 57 receiving placebo). Baseline characteristics and baseline patient reported outcomes were well balanced between arms. The AUC over the 8 weeks for treatment A was 51.4 (SD = 16 and for placebo was 49.7 (SD = 15), with a P value of 0.7. The FOSQ was not statistically significantly different between groups. There was no statistically significant difference between groups for the POMS week 8 treatment A 6.9 vs. placebo 6.0; p=0.90. For the BFI at week 8 the treatment A and placebo arm scored respectively for fatigue now 22.1 vs. 10.5; p<0.01; for usual fatigue 19.4 vs. 10.0; p=0.05; for worst fatigue 14.8 vs. 12.4; p=0.65; and for activity inference 12.3 vs. 10.8; p=0.75.There were no significant differences in toxicities as measured by self\u2010report or the CTCAE. Treatment A was not more effective than placebo on sleep quality in patients who were undergoing cancer treatment.",

The results showed that there wasn't a big difference between the group that got treatment A and the group that got the fake pill. Both groups had similar sleep quality throughout the study. The patients who got treatment A didn't sleep any better than those who got the fake pill.
