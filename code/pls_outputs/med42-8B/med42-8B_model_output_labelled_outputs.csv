Randomized trial of fenretinide to prevent second breast malignancy in women with early breast cancer",J Natl Cancer Inst,"Background:
Treatment A has been shown to inhibit breast carcinogenesis in preclinical studies. We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.
Methods:
We randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30‐70 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66‐1.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64‐1.09; P = .177) between the two arms. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs (38 in the treatment A arm versus 40 in the control arm), incidence of distant metastasis (HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.79‐1.22; P = .858), and all‐cause mortality (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.92‐1.48; P = .215).
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than no treatment in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.",no_spin,"This study looked at a treatment called ""Treatment A"" to see if it could help prevent a second breast cancer in women who already had breast cancer. They took 2972 women, aged 30-70, who had their first breast cancer removed, and randomly assigned them to either take Treatment A for 5 years or not take any treatment. They followed these women for 7 years and checked for any new breast cancer or other cancers. At the end, they found no difference in the number of women who got a second breast cancer or other cancers between the two groups. So, Treatment A did not seem to be more helpful than not taking any treatment in preventing a second breast cancer."

Methods:
We randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30‐70 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) or no treatment. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. Other end points considered post hoc were the same outcomes stratified by menopausal status, incidence of distant metastases, overall mortality, and tumors in other organs. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (P =.642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (P =.177) between the two arms. However, an interaction was detected between treatment A and menopausal status in both outcomes (P for interaction in both outcomes =.045), with a possible beneficial effect in premenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66, and 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.41‐1.07; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 0.65, and 95% CI = 0.46‐0. 92) and an opposite effect in postmenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.32, and 95% CI = 0.82‐2.15; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.19, and 95% CI = 0.75‐1. 89). There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs, incidence of distant metastasis, and all‐cause mortality.
Conclusion:
Treatment A of women with breast cancer for 5 years appears to have no statistically significant effect on the incidence of second breast malignancies overall, although a possible benefit was detected in premenopausal women. These studies, particularly the post hoc analyses, are considered exploratory and need to be confirmed.",spin,"This study looked at a treatment called ""Treatment A"" to see if it could help prevent a second breast cancer in women who already had breast cancer. They took 2972 women, aged 30-70, who had their first breast cancer removed and divided them into two groups. One group got Treatment A for 5 years, and the other group didn't get any treatment. They wanted to see if there was a difference in getting a second breast cancer 7 years later between the two groups. They also looked at other things like whether the cancer spread to other parts of the body or if the women died from any cause.

After 97 months, they found no big difference in getting a second breast cancer between the two groups. But, they did find that Treatment A might help premenopausal women (women who haven't gone through menopause) from getting a second breast cancer, but it might not help postmenopausal women (women who have gone through menopause). They said this study needs to be confirmed because it's just one study, and they're not sure if Treatment A really helps or not."

It is uncertain whether treatment A provides additional benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. This trial was initiated to explore this question.
Patients and methods:
Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization. The two end points of interest for this study were time to treatment failure (TTF) and survival time.
Results:
Median survival was 30.0 months for chemotherapy alone and 29.3 months treatment A and chemotherapy, p=0.834. Time to treatment failure (TTF) was 13.4 months for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with 10.3 month for chemotherapy alone patients (P = .087). The response rates (complete response and partial response) was 69.2% of for patients who received chemotherapy alone and 68.9% for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy, P =.99. There was no significant difference in toxicities seen between the two arms of the study. There were four lethal toxicities. Three infectious deaths occurred in patients receiving treatment A with chemotherapy.
Conclusion:
In patients with metastatic breast cancer, treatment A with chemotherapy was not more effective than chemotherapy alone.",no_spin,"This study was about trying to find out if a new treatment (called treatment A) works better than just chemotherapy alone for people with breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. They took 231 patients and divided them into two groups: one group got chemotherapy alone, and the other group got treatment A along with chemotherapy. They looked at how long the cancer took to get worse (time to treatment failure) and how long the patients lived (survival time). The results showed that both groups had similar survival times (about 30 months) and time to treatment failure (around 10-13 months). The response rates (how many patients got better) were also very similar (around 69%). There were some side effects, but they were not very different between the two groups. In the end, the study found that treatment A with chemotherapy was not more effective than chemotherapy alone for people with metastatic breast cancer."

It is uncertain whether treatment A provides additional benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. This trial was initiated to explore this question.
Patients and methods:
Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with estrogen receptor (ER)‐positive or ER‐unknown metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization.
Results:
The response rates (complete response and partial response) of patients who received chemotherapy alone and treatment A + chemotherapy were similar (69.2% v 68.9%, respectively; P =.99). Time to treatment failure (TTF) was slightly longer for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone patients (13.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.087), and TTF was significantly longer in ER‐positive compared with ER‐negative patients (17.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.048). However, ER status had no effect on overall survival (30.0 months for chemotherapy alone v 29.3 months for treatment A + chemotherapy).
Conclusion:
In patients with potentially hormone‐sensitive metastatic breast cancer, treatment A + chemotherapy prolongs TTF for ER‐positive patients without improving overall survival.",spin,"Alright, let's break this down for your fifth grader. This passage is about a study that tried to find out if a new treatment (called ""Treatment A"") helps more than just chemotherapy alone for breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. 

The study took 231 patients with breast cancer between 1988 and 1992 and divided them into two groups. One group received chemotherapy alone, and the other group received Treatment A along with chemotherapy. The study looked at how well the cancer responded to the treatments and how long it took for the cancer to get worse again.

The results showed that both groups had similar success rates in making the cancer smaller or go away completely. However, the group that received Treatment A along with chemotherapy had a slightly longer time before the cancer got worse again. But, the study found that the overall survival time (how long the patients lived) was the same for both groups.

So, the study concluded that Treatment A might help a little bit for breast cancer patients whose cancer is sensitive to hormones, but it doesn't improve how long they live overall."
27,11261827,Phase III randomized trial of toremifene vs tamoxifen in hormonodependant advanced breast cancer,Breast Cancer Res Treat,"Purpose:
Efficacy and safety of treatment A was compared with comparator B in a group of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, without previous systemic therapy for advanced breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
The study was a prospective double‐blind randomized trial. All treated patients presented with positive estrogen receptors. Main end points were response rates, toxicity profile analysis, time to progression and survival. WHO and ECOG criteria were employed for response evaluation while toxicity was assessed according to WHO guidelines. Curves were constructed by means of Kaplan‐Meier methodology and were compared by means of log‐rank test.
Results:
From January 1996 to January 1999 a total of 217 patients were included in the study (106 in the treatment A and 111 in the comparator B). Both groups of patients were homogeneous regarding the main prognostic factors. A response rate of 64% (68/106) was observed in the treatment A group as compared with a 52% (58/111) in the comparator B group. Median times to progression and overall survival were not significantly different. A lower incidence of undesirable effects was appreciated in the treatment A arm.
Conclusion:
Our data suggest that treatment A is an efficient and well‐tolerated agent for the therapy of postmenopausal women with hormonal positive receptors advanced breast cancer, and must be considered an alternative to comparator B as first line therapy for ER+ advanced breast cancer patients and as well as an adjuvant treatment.",spin,"This study compared two treatments for breast cancer in older women. Both treatments had not been used before for advanced breast cancer. The study was like a game where half the women got one treatment and the other half got the other. The researchers looked at how well the treatments worked and how safe they were. They found that one treatment worked better and had fewer side effects. So, this treatment could be a good choice for older women with breast cancer that has not been treated before, and also for women who need extra help after their main treatment."

To compare the efficacy and tolerability of treatment A with comparator B in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in patients whose disease progresses on prior endocrine treatment.
Patients and methods:
In this double‐blind, double‐dummy, parallel‐group study, postmenopausal patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP). Secondary end points included time to treatment failure (TTF), objective response (OR) rate, duration of response (DOR), and tolerability.
Results:
Patients (n = 400) were followed for a median period of 16.8 months. Treatment A was not more effective than comparator B in terms of TTP (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 1.14; P =.43); median TTP was 5.4 months with treatment A and 3.4 months with comparator B. There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups for TTF. Median TTF was 4.6 months for treatment A and 3.3 months for comparator B (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.19; P = .69). At the time of this data analysis, the rate of deaths was respectively for treatment A and comparator B, 35.4% (n=73) vs. 33.5% (n=65). OR rates were 17.5% with both treatments. DOR was statistically significantly greater for treatment A compared with comparator B; the ratio of average response durations was 1.35 (95% CI, 1.10 to 1.67; P < 0.01). Both treatments were well tolerated.

Both treatments were well tolerated.
Conclusion:
Treatment A was at least as effective as comparator B, with efficacy end points slightly favoring treatment A.

The primary outcome was the overall response rate. Overall, 198 patients received the planned chemotherapy dose (99 patients (94.2%) in the EPI arm and 99 patients (93.4%) in the EPI+treatment A arm). There was no statistically significant difference in overall response rate between the two treatment arms (76 versus 82% in the EPI and EPI+treatment A arms respectively). Pathological complete response was documented respectively in EPI and EPI+treatment A in 5 (4.8%) and 7 (6.7%) patients, and respectively 3 (2.9%) and 6 (5.7%) patients had carcinoma in situ. Toxicity did not differ from that expected with epirubicin. Leukopenia was the most relevant side effect, with about 50% of patients experiencing grade III‐IV toxicity in both arms. Platelet toxicity was uncommon and mild. Grade II‐III hemoglobin was observed in 15% of patients. Diarrhea and mucositis from mild to moderate occurred in 10% of patients.

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy with or without treatment A primarily on disease‐free survival (DFS) and secondarily on overall survival (OS) in patients with high‐risk operable breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
From June 1997 until November 2000, 604 patients with T1‐3N1M0 or T3N0M0 tumors were randomized to three cycles of epirubicin 110 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of treatment A followed by three cycles of 'intensified' CMF (cyclophosphamide 840 mg/m2, methotrexate 47 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 840 mg/m2) (group A), or to four cycles of epirubicin followed by four cycles of CMF, as in group A (group B).

To determine whether treatment A, improves survival in patients with brain metastases when used as an adjunct to whole‐brain radiation therapy (WBRT).
Patients and methods:
Patients with brain metastases from solid tumors and a Karnofsky performance score of > or = 70 were randomly assigned to receive WBRT with supplemental oxygen and either treatment A (treatment A arm) or no treatment (control arm). The primary end point was survival.
Results:
The study consisted of 515 eligible patients (treatment A arm, n = 265; control arm, n = 250). The median survival time (MST) was 5.4 months for the treatment A arm versus 4.4 months for the control arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87; P = .16). For the subgroup of patients with non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or breast cancer, the MST was 6.0 and 4.4 months, respectively (HR = 0.82; P = .07). Cox multiple regression analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of death for the treatment A arm in both primary populations. Further analysis indicated that the benefit may be restricted to the subgroup of patients with breast cancer. Response rates (radiographic complete response plus partial response) improved by 7% (P = .10) and 13% (P = .01) for all patients and for NSCLC and breast cancer patients in the treatment A arm, respectively. The most common severe adverse event in patients treated with treatment A was hypoxemia, which was reversible and effectively managed with supplemental oxygen in most patients.
Conclusion:
The addition of treatment A to WBRT may improve response rates and survival in patients with brain metastases, particularly metastases from breast cancer. A confirmatory trial for breast cancer patients has been initiated.",spin,"Alright, let's break this down for your fifth grader. This passage is about a study that tried to find out if a treatment called ""Treatment A"" can help people with brain tumors (called brain metastases) when used along with another treatment called whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT). 

The study took 515 patients with brain metastases and divided them into two groups. One group received WBRT and Treatment A, while the other group only got WBRT. The researchers looked at how long each group lived and found that the group with Treatment A lived a little longer (5.4 months) compared to the group without Treatment A (4.4 months). 

However, this difference was not big enough to be considered ""statistically significant,"" which means it could be due to chance. The study also found that Treatment A seemed to help breast cancer patients more than lung cancer patients. 

The study also looked at how well the tumors responded to Treatment A and found that they responded better in the group that received Treatment A. The most common side effect of Treatment A was low oxygen levels in the blood, but this was easily managed with extra oxygen.

Overall, the study suggests that Treatment A might help people with brain metastases, especially breast cancer patients, but more research is needed to confirm this."
52,16314619,Phase III study of efaproxiral as an adjunct to whole-brain radiation therapy for brain metastases,J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
To determine whether treatment A, improves survival in patients with brain metastases when used as an adjunct to whole‐brain radiation therapy (WBRT).
Patients and methods:
Patients with brain metastases from solid tumors and a Karnofsky performance score of > or = 70 were randomly assigned to receive WBRT with supplemental oxygen and either treatment A (treatment A arm) or no treatment (control arm). The primary end point was survival.
Results:
The study consisted of 515 eligible patients (treatment A arm, n = 265; control arm, n = 250). The median survival time (MST) was 5.4 months for the treatment A arm versus 4.4 months for the control arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87; P = .16). There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups for response rate (complete plus partial response) (46% for the treatment A arm and 38% for the control arm; P = .10). There was not a statistically significant difference in the cumulative incidence at 1 year after random assignment of radiographic (21% treatment A vs. 18% control; p=0.53) or clinical progression (49% treatment A vs. 51% control; p = 0.49) in the brain between the treatment groups. At 6 months, respectively 16% and 15% of the patients had a stable or improving quality of life in treatment A arm and control arm. The most common severe adverse event in patients treated with treatment A was hypoxemia.
Conclusion:
The addition of treatment A to WBRT was not more effective than WBRT alone in patients with brain metastases.",no_spin,"Alright, let's break this down for your fifth grader. Imagine there's a group of people who have a type of cancer that has spread to their brain. This is called brain metastases. Doctors want to know if adding a new treatment (called treatment A) to the usual treatment (whole-brain radiation therapy or WBRT) can help these patients live longer.

The study had 515 patients, half of them got treatment A along with WBRT, and the other half just got WBRT. The study looked at how long people lived, if their cancer got better or worse, and if they had any bad side effects from the treatments.

The results showed that people who got treatment A and WBRT lived about the same amount of time as those who just got WBRT. There wasn't a big difference in how their cancer responded to treatment or if they got worse. Also, there wasn't a big difference in how their quality of life changed. The most common bad side effect from treatment A was low oxygen levels in the blood.

So, the study found that adding treatment A to WBRT didn't make a big difference in helping people with brain metastases live longer or feel better."

To compare treatment A and comparator B in node‐positive, operable breast cancer patients.
Methods and materials:
This was a randomized, multicenter, phase III trial enrolling 638 eligible women with prior breast surgery and positive axillary dissection. Patients in Arm A received treatment A, with concomitant radiotherapy (50 Gy +/‐ 10‐20‐Gy boost). Patients in Arm B received comparator B, with subsequent radiotherapy.
Results:
Median treatment durations were 64 and 126 days (Arms A and B, respectively), with no significant difference in overall or disease‐free survival. Five‐year locoregional relapse‐free survival favored patients with conservative surgery (two thirds of the population), with less local and / or regional recurrence in Arm A than in Arm B (3% vs. 9%; p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis in this subgroup showed a 2.8‐fold increased risk of locoregional recurrence with comparator B, independent of other prognostic factors (p = 0.027). Febrile neutropenia and Grade 3‐4 leukopenia were significantly more frequent in Arm A. Subclinical left ventricular ejection fraction events at 1 year were more frequent with treatment A (p = 0.02).
Conclusion:
Treatment A has significantly better locoregional control in node‐positive breast cancer after conservative surgery and 50% shorter treatment, albeit with slightly more acute toxicity.",spin,"This study compared two treatments for breast cancer patients who had surgery and had cancer in their lymph nodes. Treatment A and Treatment B were given to different groups of patients. Both treatments had radiation, but Treatment A's radiation was given at the same time as the treatment, while Treatment B's radiation was given after the treatment. The study found that Treatment A worked better for patients who had smaller surgeries, and it also took less time to finish Treatment A. However, Treatment A caused more side effects like febrile neutropenia and Grade 3-4 leukopenia. Overall, both treatments had similar survival rates, but Treatment A was better for controlling cancer in the breast area and nearby lymph nodes."

Patients and methods:
Between March 1991 and June 1999, 1863 women with stages I‐IIIA operable breast cancer who had undergone surgery and completed six cycles of adjuvant combination chemotherapy with either CMF, CAF, CEF, FAC or FEC were randomized to receive either treatment A for 3 years or no further treatment. Irrespective of menstrual status and hormone receptor content of the primary tumor, patients were stratified by institute, chemotherapy scheme and age (above 50 years or younger). The main end‐point was to detect a 5% increase in the 5 year survival (from 80% to 85%) in favor of treatment A. Secondary end‐ points were relapse free survival (RFS), local control, incidence of second primary breast cancer.
Results:
After exclusion of all patients from three sites because of inadequate documentation, a total of 1724 patients (93%) were analyzed (Treatment A 861 and Control 863). At a median follow‐up of 6.5 years, 396 deaths (23%) and 602 RFS events (35%) (relapse and/or death) have been observed.

To assess whether the use of intervention A as an adjunct to colposcopy increases the detection of biopsy confirmed CIN 2, 3 (high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia).
Methods:
This is a multicenter two‐arm randomized trial comparing colposcopy alone with colposcopy plus intervention A. Patients were recruited from 13 colposcopy clinics in a variety of practice settings. 2299 women referred for the evaluation of an abnormal cervical cytology were randomized with stratification by cytology; subsequently 113 women were excluded for a variety of reasons. The main study outcomes were differences in true‐positive rates (CIN 2, 3 and cancer identified) and false‐positive rates between the study arms.
Results:
The true‐positive (TP) rates were 14.4% vs. 11.4% (p=0.035, one‐sided) for the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm compared to colposcopy‐only arm, respectively, in women with either an atypical squamous cell (ASC) or low‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) cytology result. TP rates were similar between the two arms among women referred for the evaluation of HSIL (high‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). The 26.5% gain in true‐positives observed with the use of intervention A and colposcopy among women referred for an ASC or LSIL cytology was achieved with only a fractional increase in number of biopsies obtained per patient (0.30) and a modest increase in false‐positive rate
(4%). In the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm among women with ASC or LSIL, the PPV (positive predictive value) of biopsies indicated by ntervention A was 15.0% and the PPV of biopsies indicated by colposcopy was 15.2%. Joint hypothesis testing indicates that intervention A and colposcopy provides benefit compared to colposcopy alone among women with ASC or LSIL.
Conclusion:
Combining intervention A with colposcopy provides a clinically meaningful increase in the detection of CIN 2, 3 in women referred for the evaluation of mildly abnormal cytology results.",spin,"Alright, let's break down this passage into simpler terms for your fifth grader. 

Imagine you're trying to find a hidden treasure (CIN 2, 3) in a big forest (women's cervix). You have a map (colposcopy) that helps you find the treasure, but sometimes it's hard to find it. So, someone invented a new tool (intervention A) to help you find the treasure better. This study is like a big experiment to see if using this new tool with the map (colposcopy) helps you find more treasure than just using the map alone.

The study took 2299 women who had abnormal test results (like a warning sign that there might be treasure hidden) and divided them into two groups. One group used the map (colposcopy) alone, and the other group used the map and the new tool (intervention A) together. They compared how well each group found the treasure (CIN 2, 3) and how many times they thought there was treasure when there wasn't (false-positives).

The results showed that when they used both the map and the new tool, they found more treasure (14.4% vs. 11.4%) in women with mild warning signs (ASC or LSIL). They also found that using the new tool didn't increase the number of biopsies (looking for treasure) too much and only slightly increased the chances of thinking there was"

To assess whether the use of intervention A as an adjunct to colposcopy increases the detection of biopsy confirmed CIN 2,3 (high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia).
Methods:
This is a multicenter two‐arm randomized trial comparing colposcopy alone with colposcopy plus intervention A. Patients were recruited from 13 colposcopy clinics in a variety of practice settings. 2299 women referred for the evaluation of an abnormal cervical cytology were randomized with stratification by cytology; subsequently 113 women were excluded for a variety of reasons. The main study outcomes were differences in true‐positive rates (biopsy confirmed CIN 2, 3 and cancer) and false‐positive rates (all women having at least one cervical biopsy taken with none of the biopies diagnosed as CIN 2,3, or cancer) between the study arms.
Results:
The final analyzed populations were 1096 in the colposcopy only arm and 1090 in the colposcopy plus intervention A arm. There was no statistically significant difference in the true positive rate between the 2 groups. The true positive rate was 19.9% (218/1096) in the colposcopy‐only arm vs 21.8% (238/1090) in the colposcopy plus intervention A arm; p=0.143. The false positive rate was 57.4% (629/1096) in the colposcopy‐only arm vs 60.5% (659/1090) in the colposcopy plus intervention A arm. No biopsy was performed in 239 (27.4%) in the colposcopy‐only arm and 193 (17.7%) in the colposcopy plus intervention A arm. The average number of biopsies was 1.03 for the colposcopy‐only arm and 1.30 for the colposcopy plus intervention A arm. Four subjects experienced minor adverse events during the study in both arms.

They checked how many women in each group had a biopsy (a small tissue sample) that showed CIN 2,3 or cancer. They also checked how many women had biopsies that didn't show any problems.

In the end, they found that using intervention A with colposcopy didn't make a big difference in finding CIN 2,3 compared to using colposcopy alone. So, combining intervention A with colposcopy didn't seem to be better for detecting serious problems in the cervix.

This phase III randomized open‐label clinical trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment A versus comparator B as first‐line treatment for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in postmenopausal women.
Patients and methods:
The study was conducted at 81 centers and enrolled postmenopausal patients with measurable hormone‐sensitive metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer. Prior adjuvant chemotherapy and/or comparator B were allowed. One previous chemotherapy regimen and no prior hormone therapy for advanced disease were permitted. Patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment A or comparator B until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. Progression‐free survival (PFS) as the primary study end point.
Results:
Of the 382 patients randomized at 79 sites, 371 (182 treatment A, 189 comparator B) were included in the analysis. No treatment related death were observed. A total of 319 events (progression or death) were observed: 161 (85%) in the comparator B arm and 158 (87%) in the treatment A arm. Median progression‐ free survival (PFS) (primary outcome) was 5.8 months with comparator B (95% CI, 5.3 to 8.1 months) vs 9.9 months; (95% CI, 8.7 to 11.8 months) with treatment A, HR = 0.84 (95% CI, 0.67 to 1.05), p = .121.

17,18955454,"Phase III, double-blind, randomized study comparing lapatinib plus paclitaxel with placebo plus paclitaxel as first-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer",J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
Treatment A is effective against HER‐2‐positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy of treatment A in HER‐2‐negative and HER‐2‐uncharacterized MBC.
Patients and methods:
Women with MBC were randomly assigned to first‐line therapy with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks plus treatment A or placebo. A preplanned retrospective evaluation of HER‐2 status was performed using fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP); secondary end points were objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), event‐free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS).
Results:
In the intent‐to‐treat population (n = 579), there were no significant differences in TTP, EFS, or OS between treatment arms, although differences in ORR and CBR were noted. In 86 HER‐2‐positive patients (15%), treatment with paclitaxel‐ treatment A resulted in statistically significant improvements in TTP, EFS, ORR, and CBR compared with paclitaxel‐placebo. No differences between treatment groups were observed for any end point in HER‐2‐negative patients. The most common adverse events were alopecia, rash, and diarrhea. The incidence of diarrhea and rash was significantly higher in the paclitaxel‐treatment A arm. The rate of cardiac events was low, and no difference was observed between treatment arms.
Conclusion:
Patients with HER‐2‐negative or HER‐2‐untested MBC did not benefit from the addition of treatment A to paclitaxel. However, first‐line therapy with paclitaxel‐ treatment A significantly improved clinical outcomes in HER‐2‐positive patients. Prospective evaluation of the efficacy and safety of this combination is ongoing in early and metastatic HER‐2‐positive breast cancer patients.",spin,"This study looked at a new treatment (called Treatment A) for breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (called metastatic breast cancer or MBC).

The study compared Treatment A with a placebo (a fake treatment that doesn't actually help) when given with another medicine called paclitaxel. The study looked at how long it took for the cancer to get worse (time to progression), how many women's cancer got smaller (objective response rate), how many women felt better (clinical benefit rate), and how long women lived (overall survival).

The study found that Treatment A helped women with HER-2-positive MBC, but it didn't help women with HER-2-negative or untested MBC. The most common side effects were hair loss, rash, and diarrhea, and these side effects were more common in the group that got Treatment A. The study is still ongoing for early and metastatic HER-2-positive breast cancer patients.

This phase III study compared the efficacy and safety of treatment A with comparator B in advanced breast cancer.
Patients and methods:
Patients were randomly assigned to treatment A or comparator B. Comparison of progression‐free survival (PFS) was the primary objective.

Overall response rate (ORR) was 32% in both arms, and overall survival (OS) was not different between arms (P = .983). Time to treatment failure (TTF; defined as discontinuation, progressive disease, death as a result of any cause, or the start of a new anticancer therapy) was superior in the treatment A arm (P = .059).

Conclusion:
No difference was observed between treatment A and comparator B arms in PFS, ORR, and OS. TTF was longer in the treatment A arm.

Many cancer patients continue to smoke postdiagnosis, yet there have been few smoking cessation trials for this population. Depression, which is prevalent among cancer patients, may be a barrier to cessation.
Methods:
This double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial randomized 246 cancer patients to 9 weeks of placebo or treatment A, stratifying by pre‐treatment depression symptoms. In addition, all patients received transdermal nicotine and behavioral counseling. Primary outcomes were 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence, biochemically confirmed, at the end of treatment (Week 12), and at 6 months post quit day (Week 27).

Results:
There was no main effect of treatment A vs. placebo on abstinence (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.38‐4.81, p = 0.64).

Conclusion:
For patients with depression symptoms, treatment increases abstinence rates, lowers withdrawal, and increases quality of life. However, abstinence rates among patients with depression symptoms were low vs. patients without depression symptoms, who exhibited similar abstinence rates when treated with treatment A or transdermal nicotine and counseling alone. These results can guide future smoking cessation intervention studies with cancer patients.",spin,"This study looked at helping cancer patients quit smoking.

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment A in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer (OC).
Methods:
Patients with platinum‐refractory or ‐resistant primary or secondary) OC were randomized to receive treatment A and PLD at 50 mg/m2 intravenously or PLD alone at 50 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 every 28 days until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression‐free survival (PFS). Other end points were objective response rate and safety. The study was originally planned for 244 patients. The trial was temporarily placed on hold after 125 patients were randomized while the results of another trial were being reviewed and the sponsor decided not to resume enrollment. The interim analysis became the final analysis.
Results:
The median PFS was 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD (n = 65) versus 3.7 months for PLD (n = 60) (hazards ratio, 0.92; P = 0.7243). A preplanned subgroup analysis showed that 75 patients with platinum‐refractory or primary platinum‐resistant OC had a median PFS of 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD versus 2.9 months for PLD (hazards ratio, 0.55; P = 0.0425).

The new treatment is called ""Treatment A"" and it's being tested with another medicine called pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD). 

The study wanted to see if Treatment A, when combined with PLD, is safer and more effective than PLD alone for women with ovarian cancer that doesn't respond well to a common treatment called platinum. 

To do this, they took 125 women with this type of ovarian cancer and randomly assigned them to either receive Treatment A and PLD together or just PLD alone. They looked at how long the cancer didn't get worse (called progression-free survival), how well the treatment worked (called objective response rate), and how safe the treatment was.

The results showed that Treatment A combined with PLD didn't make the cancer get worse any slower than PLD alone. It also didn't make the cancer shrink more than PLD alone. However, Treatment A combined with PLD caused more side effects like low blood cell counts and less side effects like hand-foot syndrome and mouth sores compared to PLD alone. 

Overall, the study found that Treatment A combined with PLD wasn't more effective than PLD alone for women with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer."

This phase III trial assesses whether treatment A increases the duration of functional independence after surgery or radiosurgery of brain metastases.
Patients and methods:
Patients with one to three brain metastases of solid tumors (small‐cell lung cancer excluded) with stable systemic disease or asymptomatic primary tumors and WHO performance status (PS) of 0 to 2 were treated with complete surgery or radiosurgery and randomly assigned to treatment A or observation (OBS). The primary end point was time to WHO PS deterioration to more than 2.
Results:
Of 359 patients, 199 underwent radiosurgery, and 160 underwent surgery. In the radiosurgery group, 100 patients were allocated to OBS, and 99 were allocated to treatment A. After surgery, 79 patients were allocated to OBS, and 81 were allocated to treatment A. The median time to WHO PS more than 2 was 10.0 months (95% CI, 8.1 to 11.7 months) after OBS and 9.5 months (95% CI, 7.8 to 11.9 months) after treatment A (P = .71). Overall survival was similar in the treatment A and OBS arms (median, 10.9 v 10.7 months, respectively; P = .89). Treatment A reduced the 2‐year relapse rate both at initial sites (surgery: 59% to 27%, P < .001; radiosurgery: 31% to 19%, P = .040) and at new sites (surgery: 42% to 23%, P = .008; radiosurgery: 48% to 33%, P = .023). Salvage therapies were used more frequently after OBS than after treatment A. Intracranial progression caused death in 78 (44%) of 179 patients in the OBS arm and in 50 (28%) of 180 patients in the treatment A arm.
Conclusion:
After radiosurgery or surgery of a limited number of brain metastases, treatment A reduces intracranial relapses and neurologic deaths but fails to improve the duration of functional independence and overall survival.",spin,"This study is about people who have cancer that has spread to their brain. They need surgery or a special kind of radiation called radiosurgery to remove or shrink the cancer in their brain. The study wants to know if a new treatment, called treatment A, can help these people stay independent and healthy longer after their surgery or radiosurgery. 

The study took 359 people with brain cancer and divided them into two groups. One group got treatment A, and the other group just had surgery or radiosurgery and didn't get treatment A. The study looked at how long it took for people's health to get worse and if they lived longer with treatment A or without it. 

The study found that treatment A didn't make people live longer or stay healthy longer. But it did help them avoid their cancer coming back in their brain. So, treatment A might be good for helping people avoid brain cancer coming back, but it doesn't help them live longer or stay healthy longer."

We examined the value of treatment A in a phase III trial with strict preoperative staging and surgical resection guidelines.
Patients and methods:
Patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagogastric junction (AEG II and III) were randomly assigned to treatment A followed by surgery or to surgery alone. To detect with 80% power an improvement in median survival from 17 months with surgery alone to 24 months with treatment A, 282 events were required.
Results:
This trial was stopped for poor accrual after 144 patients were randomly assigned (72:72); 52.8% patients had tumors located in the proximal third of the stomach, including AEG type II and III. The International Union against Cancer R0 resection rate was 81.9% after treatment A as compared with 66.7% with surgery alone (P = .036). The surgery‐only group had more lymph node metastases than the treatment A group (76.5% v 61.4%; P = .018).

After a median follow‐up of 4.4 years and 67 deaths, a survival benefit could not be shown (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.35; P = .466).
Conclusion:
This trial showed a significantly increased R0 resection rate but failed to demonstrate a survival benefit. Possible explanations are low statistical power, a high rate of proximal gastric cancer including AEG and/or a better outcome than expected after radical surgery alone due to the high quality of surgery with resections of regional lymph nodes outside the perigastic area (celiac trunc, hepatic ligament, lymph node at a. lienalis; D2).",spin,"This study was about testing a new treatment (called treatment A) for stomach cancer.

However, they couldn't show that treatment A made people live longer than surgery alone. This might be because the study had too few patients or because surgery alone worked better than expected. So, they concluded that treatment A increased the chance of complete cancer removal but didn't show a survival benefit."

After following these people for about 4 years, they found that both groups lived about the same amount of time - 64.6 months for the Treatment A group and 52.5 months for the surgery-only group. This means that Treatment A didn't make people live longer than they would have with surgery alone.

The study also looked at other things, like how many people had their cancer completely removed by surgery (81.9% in the Treatment A group and 66.7% in the surgery-only group) and how many people had complications after surgery (27.1% in the Treatment A group and 16.2% in the surgery-only group).

A phase III study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) to evaluate the effect on response rate and survival of a treatment A.
Patients and methods:
Four hundred fifty‐six patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B in combination with 5‐FU (500 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) i.v., every 21 days for a maximum of six cycles (eight in case of CR).
Results:
Of 456 patients, 390 were evaluable for efficacy. Objective response (CR + PR) was seen in 57% (treatment A) vs. 41% (comparator B) of the evaluable patients (P = 0.003). The CR rate was higher in the treatment A arm (12% vs. 7%, P = 0.07). Treatment A produced significantly higher response rates in patients with visceral localization (50% vs. 34%, P = 0.011) and in patients with more than two metastatic organ sites (64% vs. 37%, P = 0.001). Median time to progression (7.6 vs. 7 months) and overall survival (18 months vs. 17 months) were similar. Myelosuppression was the principal toxic effect, with grade IV neutropenia observed in 57% of the patients treated with treatment A vs. 9% of those on comparator B. Grade IV infection or febrile neutropenia were observed in 8% (treatment A) vs. 0.4% (comparator B), but the incidence of septic death was the same in the two arms (two patients each). Cardiac toxicity was similar in the two treatment groups, with 5% vs. 3% of the patients taken off study due to cardiac events, primarily due to a decline in LVEF. Only three patients (two in treatment A) experienced congestive heart failure.

The experiment wanted to see if Treatment A worked better than Treatment B in making the cancer smaller or go away completely (this is called response rate) and if it helped people live longer (this is called survival). They also wanted to see if Treatment A caused more side effects.

The results showed that Treatment A made the cancer smaller or go away in 57% of the people, while Treatment B did it in 41% of the people. This difference was significant, which means it's not just a coincidence. Treatment A also worked better for people with cancer in their internal organs (visceral localization) and for people with cancer in more than two different parts of their body (more than two metastatic organ sites).

However, Treatment A caused more side effects, like a decrease in the number of blood cells (myelosuppression) and infections. But, Treatment A did not make people live longer than Treatment B. The time it took for the cancer to start growing again ("

A phase III study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) to evaluate the effect on response rate and survival of a treatment A.
Patients and methods:
Four hundred fifty‐six patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B in combination with 5‐FU (500 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) i.v., every 21 days for a maximum of six cycles (eight in case of CR). The primary outcome was overall survival.
Results:
Of 456 patients randomized to treatment A (214) or comparator B (242), 390 were evaluable for efficacy (treatment A 182, comparator B 208). There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups for the primary outcome with a median survival of 18 and 17 months, respectively for treatment A and comparator B (P = 0.54). Objective response (CR + PR) was seen in 57% (treatment A) vs. 41% (comparator B) of the evaluable patients (P = 0.003). The median duration of response was 9.1 months on treatment A and 9.3 on comparator B, the median Time to Treatment Failure (TTF) was, respectively, 5.8 vs. 5.3 months (P = 0.7). Myelosuppression was the principal toxic effect, with grade IV neutropenia observed in 57% of the patients treated with treatment A vs. 9% of those on comparator B. Grade IV infection or febrile neutropenia were observed in 8% (treatment A) vs. 0.4% (comparator B), but the incidence of septic death was the same in the two arms (two patients each). Cardiac toxicity was similar in the two treatment groups, with 5% vs. 3% of the patients taken off study due to cardiac events, primarily due to a decline in LVEF. Three patients (two in treatment A) experienced congestive heart failure.
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than comparator B in patients with metastatic breast cancer.",no_spin,"Alright, let's break this down for your fifth grader. Imagine there's a big group of people who have a type of cancer that has spread to other parts of their body (metastatic breast cancer). Doctors want to know if a new treatment (called treatment A) works better than an older treatment (called comparator B) to help these people feel better and live longer.

To find out, they took 456 people with this type of cancer and randomly put them into two groups. One group got treatment A, and the other group got comparator B. Both groups also received two other medicines (5-FU and cyclophosphamide) to help with the cancer.

The doctors looked at how long people lived (overall survival) and how many people's cancer got better (objective response). They found that treatment A didn't make people live longer than comparator B. However, treatment A did make more people's cancer get better (57% vs. 41%).

But, treatment A also caused more side effects, like a low number of blood cells (myelosuppression) and infections. The number of people who had heart problems was similar in both groups.

So, the conclusion is that treatment A wasn't better than comparator B for people with metastatic breast cancer. It made their cancer get better more often, but it didn't help them live longer, and it caused more side effects."
