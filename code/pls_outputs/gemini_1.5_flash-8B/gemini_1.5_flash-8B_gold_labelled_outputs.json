We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.\nMethods:\nWe randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30\u201070 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two\u2010sided.\nResults:\n2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66\u20101.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64\u20101.09; P = .177) between the two arms. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs (38 in the treatment A arm versus 40 in the control arm), incidence of distant metastasis (HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.79\u20101.22; P = .858), and all\u2010cause mortality (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.92\u20101.48; P = .215).\nConclusion:\nTreatment A was not more effective than no treatment in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.",

This study looked at two ways to find it:  one way was just using a special tool called colposcopy, and the other way was using colposcopy *plus* a new treatment (intervention A).\n\nThe study looked at a lot of women who had some abnormal cells in their cervix, but not yet cancer.  They randomly put some women in each group (colposcopy only, or colposcopy plus intervention A).\n\nThe results showed that using the new treatment *might* help find the pre-cancer more often in women with the less serious abnormal cells.  It didn't help much in women with the more serious abnormal cells.  Importantly, the new treatment only slightly increased the number of biopsies (small tissue samples) taken, and only slightly increased the number of false positives (finding pre-cancer when there wasn't any).\n\nSo, the new treatment *might* be helpful, but more research is needed to be sure.  The study authors are saying it's helpful, but other scientists might look at the results differently.  It's important to be careful when reading about medical studies because sometimes the results are not as clear-cut as they seem.\n"

Patients were recruited from 13 colposcopy clinics in a variety of practice settings. 2299 women referred for the evaluation of an abnormal cervical cytology were randomized with stratification by cytology; subsequently 113 women were excluded for a variety of reasons. The main study outcomes were differences in true\u2010positive rates (biopsy confirmed CIN 2, 3 and cancer) and false\u2010positive rates (all women having at least one cervical biopsy taken with none of the biopies diagnosed as CIN 2,3, or cancer) between the study arms.\nResults:\nThe final analyzed populations were 1096 in the colposcopy only arm and 1090 in the colposcopy plus intervention A arm. There was no statistically significant difference in the true positive rate between the 2 groups. The true positive rate was 19.9% (218/1096) in the colposcopy\u2010only arm vs 21.8% (238/1090) in the colposcopy plus intervention A arm; p=0.143. The false positive rate was 57.4% (629/1096) in the colposcopy\u2010only arm vs 60.5% (659/1090) in the colposcopy plus intervention A arm. No biopsy was performed in 239 (27.4%) in the colposcopy\u2010only arm and 193 (17.7%) in the colposcopy plus intervention A arm. The average number of biopsies was 1.03 for the colposcopy\u2010only arm and 1.30 for the colposcopy plus intervention A arm. Four subjects experienced minor adverse events during the study in both arms.\nConclusion:\nCombining intervention A with colposcopy was not more effective than colposcopy alone for the detection of CIN 2, 3 in women referred for the evaluation of mildly abnormal cytology results.",

In 86 HER\u20102\u2010positive patients (15%), treatment with paclitaxel\u2010 treatment A resulted in statistically significant improvements in TTP, EFS, ORR, and CBR compared with paclitaxel\u2010placebo. No differences between treatment groups were observed for any end point in HER\u20102\u2010negative patients. The most common adverse events were alopecia, rash, and diarrhea. The incidence of diarrhea and rash was significantly higher in the paclitaxel\u2010treatment A arm.

Doctors want to find the best treatment.\n\nThis study looked at a new treatment, called \"treatment A,\"  along with a standard treatment (melphalan-prednisone) to see if it was better.

This is called a \"double-blind\" study.\n\nThey followed everyone for a long time to see how long they lived (overall survival) and how long their cancer didn't get worse (progression-free survival).  They also looked at how well the treatment worked in making the cancer shrink.\n\nThe results showed that the new treatment (treatment A) didn't help people live longer overall, or stop their cancer from getting worse, compared to the fake treatment.  However, the new treatment did seem to make the cancer shrink a little more often.  But, the difference wasn't big enough to be sure it was really better.\n\nThe new treatment also caused more side effects, like constipation, nerve problems, and skin reactions, than the fake treatment.\n\nSo, the study shows that treatment A isn't better than the standard treatment for this type of cancer, when looking at how long people live.\n"

ORR was 12.3% for treatment A + PLD vs. 8.3% for PLD, p=0.5640. Hematologic adverse events were 66% on the treatment A + PLD arm versus 44% on the PLD arm with neutropenia 40.0% vs. 22.8%; thrombopenia 33.8% vs. 7.0%; febrile neutropenia10.8% vs. 3.5%. Nonhematologic adverse events were similar for both arms. The incidence of palmar\u2010plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis was lower on treatment A + PLD (23%, 31%, respectively) versus (39%, 49%, respectively) on PLD. The incidence of nausea and fatigue was higher in treatment A + PLD 60.0% vs. 49.1% and 43.1% vs. 36.8%).Thirteen deaths caused by serious adverse event were reported 7 with treatment A + PLD vs. 6 with PLD.\nConclusion:\nTreatment A in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin was not more effective than pegylated liposomal doxorubicin alone in patients with platinum\u2010 resistant ovarian cancer.
