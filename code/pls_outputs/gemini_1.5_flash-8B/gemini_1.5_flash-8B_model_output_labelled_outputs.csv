Randomized trial of fenretinide to prevent second breast malignancy in women with early breast cancer",J Natl Cancer Inst,"Background:
Treatment A has been shown to inhibit breast carcinogenesis in preclinical studies. We determined the efficacy of treatment A in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.
Methods:
We randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30‐70 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) (n=1496) or no treatment (n = 1476). Random assignment of patients was centrally managed by the coordinating center in Milan. All women were followed by use of the same procedures throughout the study period, and the radiologists who examined the mammograms were blinded to the allocated treatment arm. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
2867 assessable women were included in the analyses (1432 in the treatment A arm and 1435 in the control arm). At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (65 events in the treatment A arm versus 71 in the control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66‐1.29; P = .642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (treatment A group = 100 events; control group = 121 events; HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.64‐1.09; P = .177) between the two arms. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs (38 in the treatment A arm versus 40 in the control arm), incidence of distant metastasis (HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.79‐1.22; P = .858), and all‐cause mortality (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.92‐1.48; P = .215).
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than no treatment in preventing a second breast malignancy in women with breast cancer.",no_spin,"Imagine a doctor wants to know if a special medicine (Treatment A) can prevent a second breast cancer in women who already had one.  They took a bunch of women who had breast cancer and randomly put them into two groups.  One group got Treatment A, and the other group got no medicine at all.  They watched them for a long time (almost 8 years) to see if the medicine helped prevent a second cancer.

The results?  There wasn't a big difference between the two groups.  The medicine didn't seem to help prevent a second breast cancer in the women who took it, compared to the women who didn't.  It also didn't seem to help prevent other cancers or deaths from any cause.

So, the study didn't show that Treatment A is better than no treatment at all.  It's important to be careful when reading about studies like this, because sometimes people try to make the results sound better than they really are.

Methods:
We randomly assigned 2972 women, aged 30‐70 years, with surgically removed stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ to receive for 5 years either treatment A orally (200 mg/day) or no treatment. The primary end point was the incidence of contralateral breast cancer or ipsilateral breast cancer 7 years after randomization. Other end points considered post hoc were the same outcomes stratified by menopausal status, incidence of distant metastases, overall mortality, and tumors in other organs. The hazards of breast cancer occurrence were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Statistical tests were two‐sided.
Results:
At a median observation time of 97 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (P =.642) or ipsilateral breast cancer (P =.177) between the two arms. However, an interaction was detected between treatment A and menopausal status in both outcomes (P for interaction in both outcomes =.045), with a possible beneficial effect in premenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66, and 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.41‐1.07; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 0.65, and 95% CI = 0.46‐0. 92) and an opposite effect in postmenopausal women (contralateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.32, and 95% CI = 0.82‐2.15; ipsilateral breast cancer: adjusted HR = 1.19, and 95% CI = 0.75‐1. 89). There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms in tumors in other organs, incidence of distant metastasis, and all‐cause mortality.
Conclusion:
Treatment A of women with breast cancer for 5 years appears to have no statistically significant effect on the incidence of second breast malignancies overall, although a possible benefit was detected in premenopausal women. These studies, particularly the post hoc analyses, are considered exploratory and need to be confirmed.",spin,"Imagine a doctor is testing a medicine (Treatment A) to see if it prevents a second breast cancer in women who already have breast cancer.  They gave the medicine to some women and a placebo (fake medicine) to others.

The study looked at whether the medicine helped prevent new breast cancers in the same breast (ipsilateral) or the other breast (contralateral).  They also looked at other things like if the medicine helped prevent the cancer from spreading, or if it affected survival.

The overall results showed no clear difference between the women who took the medicine and those who didn't.  However, when they looked at the women based on whether they were pre- or post-menopause, something interesting happened.  The medicine *might* have helped prevent a second cancer in pre-menopausal women, but it might have actually *increased* the risk in post-menopausal women.

The study authors say they need more research to confirm these findings, especially since they looked at things beyond the main goal of the study (this is called ""post hoc"" analysis).  So, while there's a *possible* benefit for pre-menopausal women, it's not a definite answer yet.  The study results are not strong enough to say for sure if the medicine works.

It is uncertain whether treatment A provides additional benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. This trial was initiated to explore this question.
Patients and methods:
Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization. The two end points of interest for this study were time to treatment failure (TTF) and survival time.
Results:
Median survival was 30.0 months for chemotherapy alone and 29.3 months treatment A and chemotherapy, p=0.834. Time to treatment failure (TTF) was 13.4 months for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with 10.3 month for chemotherapy alone patients (P = .087). The response rates (complete response and partial response) was 69.2% of for patients who received chemotherapy alone and 68.9% for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy, P =.99. There was no significant difference in toxicities seen between the two arms of the study. There were four lethal toxicities. Three infectious deaths occurred in patients receiving treatment A with chemotherapy.
Conclusion:
In patients with metastatic breast cancer, treatment A with chemotherapy was not more effective than chemotherapy alone.",no_spin,"This study looked at a new treatment (Treatment A) for breast cancer that had already spread to other parts of the body.  They gave some patients Treatment A plus chemotherapy, and other patients just chemotherapy.  They tracked how long the patients lived and how long their cancer stayed under control.

The results?  There wasn't much difference.  The patients who got Treatment A plus chemo lived about the same amount of time (around 29 months) as those who just got chemo (around 30 months).  The time it took for the cancer to come back was also similar.  Even the percentage of people who had their cancer shrink (a good sign) was almost the same in both groups.  The only thing that was different was that more people in the Treatment A group died from infections.

So, the study didn't show that Treatment A made a big difference.  The researchers didn't find any real benefit from adding Treatment A to the standard chemotherapy.  It's important to be careful when reading about medical studies, because sometimes people try to make things sound better than they really are.

It is uncertain whether treatment A provides additional benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. This trial was initiated to explore this question.
Patients and methods:
Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with estrogen receptor (ER)‐positive or ER‐unknown metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or treatment A + chemotherapy as front‐line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance treatment as a secondary randomization.
Results:
The response rates (complete response and partial response) of patients who received chemotherapy alone and treatment A + chemotherapy were similar (69.2% v 68.9%, respectively; P =.99). Time to treatment failure (TTF) was slightly longer for patients who received treatment A + chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone patients (13.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.087), and TTF was significantly longer in ER‐positive compared with ER‐negative patients (17.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.048). However, ER status had no effect on overall survival (30.0 months for chemotherapy alone v 29.3 months for treatment A + chemotherapy).
Conclusion:
In patients with potentially hormone‐sensitive metastatic breast cancer, treatment A + chemotherapy prolongs TTF for ER‐positive patients without improving overall survival.",spin,"This study looked at a new treatment (Treatment A) for breast cancer that was added to regular chemotherapy.  They wanted to see if it made a difference.

The researchers gave Treatment A to some patients and regular chemotherapy to others.  They tracked how well the treatments worked and how long the patients lived.

The results showed that the new treatment didn't really help more people get better, or make them live longer overall.  However, it *might* have helped people whose breast cancer was sensitive to hormones (ER-positive) live a little longer without their cancer getting worse.  But even in that group, the difference wasn't very big.

The important thing is that the new treatment didn't make a big difference for most people.  The study authors are being a little tricky by focusing on the small improvement for one group, when the overall results aren't very good.  So, you should be careful about believing that this new treatment is a big improvement.

27,11261827,Phase III randomized trial of toremifene vs tamoxifen in hormonodependant advanced breast cancer,Breast Cancer Res Treat,"Purpose:
Efficacy and safety of treatment A was compared with comparator B in a group of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, without previous systemic therapy for advanced breast cancer.
Methods and materials:
The study was a prospective double‐blind randomized trial. All treated patients presented with positive estrogen receptors. Main end points were response rates, toxicity profile analysis, time to progression and survival. WHO and ECOG criteria were employed for response evaluation while toxicity was assessed according to WHO guidelines. Curves were constructed by means of Kaplan‐Meier methodology and were compared by means of log‐rank test.
Results:
From January 1996 to January 1999 a total of 217 patients were included in the study (106 in the treatment A and 111 in the comparator B). Both groups of patients were homogeneous regarding the main prognostic factors. A response rate of 64% (68/106) was observed in the treatment A group as compared with a 52% (58/111) in the comparator B group. Median times to progression and overall survival were not significantly different. A lower incidence of undesirable effects was appreciated in the treatment A arm.
Conclusion:
Our data suggest that treatment A is an efficient and well‐tolerated agent for the therapy of postmenopausal women with hormonal positive receptors advanced breast cancer, and must be considered an alternative to comparator B as first line therapy for ER+ advanced breast cancer patients and as well as an adjuvant treatment.",spin,"This study looked at two different treatments (A and B) for women with a specific type of advanced breast cancer.  They wanted to see which treatment worked better.

The researchers carefully picked 217 women who had never been treated for this type of cancer before and who had a certain type of breast cancer that responds to hormones.  They randomly put the women into two groups, one getting treatment A and the other getting treatment B.  Both groups were similar in other important ways that could affect the results.

The researchers tracked how well each treatment worked, how many side effects each caused, and how long the women lived.

They found that treatment A seemed to work better, with a higher percentage of women responding to it compared to treatment B.  The time it took for the cancer to get worse and the overall survival time were similar for both groups.  Importantly, treatment A seemed to have fewer side effects.

Based on these results, the researchers think treatment A is a good option for this type of cancer, and could be a better choice than treatment B for these women.

The doctors watched how the medicines worked.  They looked at how well the cancer shrunk (the ""response rate""), how long it took for the cancer to get worse, and how long the women lived.  They used special ways to measure these things.

The results showed that both medicines were about equally good.  The response rate was a little higher in the Treatment A group, but it wasn't enough to say one medicine was better than the other.  The time it took for the cancer to get worse and the women's survival times were also very similar.  One medicine seemed to have fewer side effects.

In short, the study didn't find that one medicine was clearly better than the other.

To compare the efficacy and tolerability of treatment A with comparator B in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in patients whose disease progresses on prior endocrine treatment.
Patients and methods:

The results showed that both treatments helped shrink the tumors, but adding Treatment A didn't make a big difference in how much the tumors shrunk overall, or how often the cancer went away completely.  However, Treatment A did seem to lower the Ki67 protein more than EPI alone, which is a good thing because lower Ki67 means the cancer cells are growing slower.

The study also found that tumors with a certain protein (ER-) and higher levels of Ki67 before treatment were more likely to go away completely.

The important thing to remember is that while Treatment A might be better at lowering the growth rate of cancer cells, it didn't make the cancer go away any better than the standard treatment alone.  The study authors might be trying to make it seem like Treatment A is better than it really is.  So, we need to be careful and look at more studies to be sure.

A total of 595 patients were eligible. Median follow‐up was 61.7 months for group A and 62 months for group B. The 3‐year DFS was 80% in group A and 77% in group B. Survival rates were 93% and 90%, respectively. The effect of treatment on the hazard of death was different according to hormonal receptor status. More specifically, in patients with negative receptor status the hazard of death was significantly higher for group B (hazard ratio 2.42). Both regimens were well tolerated and severe acute side‐effects were infrequent. No cases of severe cardiotoxicity or acute leukemia were recorded.
Conclusion:
The present study failed to demonstrate a significant difference in DFS or OS between the two treatment groups. However, our study has shown clearly that treatment A can be safely incorporated to dose‐dense sequential chemotherapy.",spin,"Imagine doctors are trying different ways to treat breast cancer.  This study looked at two different chemotherapy treatments (ways to kill cancer cells with medicine) for women with a certain type of breast cancer.

One group of women got a mix of medicines, including a medicine called epirubicin, another medicine called treatment A, and another called CMF.  The other group got a similar mix, but with a slightly different amount of epirubicin and CMF.

The doctors tracked how long the women lived without their cancer coming back (disease-free survival) and how long they lived overall.  After a while, they looked at the results.

The study found that both treatments were about equally good at keeping the cancer away and helping the women live longer.  However, for women whose cancer wasn't affected by hormones, one treatment seemed to be slightly worse.  Both treatments were also safe, with few side effects.

So, the study showed that a certain medicine (treatment A) can be safely used with other chemotherapy medicines, but it didn't show that one treatment was better than the other overall.

51,16314619,Phase III study of efaproxiral as an adjunct to whole-brain radiation therapy for brain metastases,J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
To determine whether treatment A, improves survival in patients with brain metastases when used as an adjunct to whole‐brain radiation therapy (WBRT).
Patients and methods:
Patients with brain metastases from solid tumors and a Karnofsky performance score of > or = 70 were randomly assigned to receive WBRT with supplemental oxygen and either treatment A (treatment A arm) or no treatment (control arm). The primary end point was survival.
Results:
The study consisted of 515 eligible patients (treatment A arm, n = 265; control arm, n = 250). The median survival time (MST) was 5.4 months for the treatment A arm versus 4.4 months for the control arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87; P = .16). For the subgroup of patients with non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or breast cancer, the MST was 6.0 and 4.4 months, respectively (HR = 0.82; P = .07). Cox multiple regression analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of death for the treatment A arm in both primary populations. Further analysis indicated that the benefit may be restricted to the subgroup of patients with breast cancer. Response rates (radiographic complete response plus partial response) improved by 7% (P = .10) and 13% (P = .01) for all patients and for NSCLC and breast cancer patients in the treatment A arm, respectively. The most common severe adverse event in patients treated with treatment A was hypoxemia, which was reversible and effectively managed with supplemental oxygen in most patients.
Conclusion:
The addition of treatment A to WBRT may improve response rates and survival in patients with brain metastases, particularly metastases from breast cancer. A confirmatory trial for breast cancer patients has been initiated.",spin,"This study looked at whether a new treatment (let's call it Treatment A) helps people with brain tumors live longer.  They took a bunch of people with brain tumors and randomly put them into two groups.  One group got Treatment A along with regular radiation treatment (like a special kind of X-ray). The other group just got the regular radiation.

The study found that people who got Treatment A lived a little longer, about 5.4 months on average, compared to 4.4 months for the group that didn't get Treatment A.  That's not a huge difference, and it wasn't a *statistically significant* difference (meaning the difference could have happened by chance).

However, when they looked at people with lung cancer or breast cancer *separately*, Treatment A seemed to help them live longer.  For example, people with breast cancer who got Treatment A lived about 6 months on average, compared to 4.4 months for those who didn't.  Again, this wasn't a huge difference, but it was close to being statistically significant.

The study also found that Treatment A might make tumors shrink a little more often in some people.  The most common side effect of Treatment A was low oxygen levels, but it was easily fixed.

Overall, the study suggests that Treatment A might help some people with brain tumors, especially those with breast cancer, live a little longer and have better tumor shrinkage."

To compare treatment A and comparator B in node‐positive, operable breast cancer patients.
Methods and materials:
This was a randomized, multicenter, phase III trial enrolling 638 eligible women with prior breast surgery and positive axillary dissection. Patients in Arm A received treatment A, with concomitant radiotherapy (50 Gy +/‐ 10‐20‐Gy boost). Patients in Arm B received comparator B, with subsequent radiotherapy.
Results:
Median treatment durations were 64 and 126 days (Arms A and B, respectively), with no significant difference in overall or disease‐free survival. Five‐year locoregional relapse‐free survival favored patients with conservative surgery (two thirds of the population), with less local and / or regional recurrence in Arm A than in Arm B (3% vs. 9%; p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis in this subgroup showed a 2.8‐fold increased risk of locoregional recurrence with comparator B, independent of other prognostic factors (p = 0.027). Febrile neutropenia and Grade 3‐4 leukopenia were significantly more frequent in Arm A. Subclinical left ventricular ejection fraction events at 1 year were more frequent with treatment A (p = 0.02).
Conclusion:

One group (Arm A) got treatment A, plus radiation therapy all at once.  The other group (Arm B) got treatment B, followed by radiation therapy.

The study found that treatment A was faster (about 64 days compared to 126 days).  Importantly, there was no difference in how long the women lived overall or how long they lived without the cancer coming back.

However, for women who had a type of less-invasive surgery, treatment A was better at preventing the cancer from coming back in the area where it started (like the breast or nearby tissues).  Treatment A had a lower rate of cancer returning in this area (3% vs. 9%).

Treatment A also had slightly more side effects, like fever and low blood cell counts.  It also seemed to have a slightly higher risk of a specific heart problem.

Overall, treatment A is better at preventing the cancer from returning in the treated area, but comes with a small increase in some short-term side effects.

Patients and methods:
Between March 1991 and June 1999, 1863 women with stages I‐IIIA operable breast cancer who had undergone surgery and completed six cycles of adjuvant combination chemotherapy with either CMF, CAF, CEF, FAC or FEC were randomized to receive either treatment A for 3 years or no further treatment. Irrespective of menstrual status and hormone receptor content of the primary tumor, patients were stratified by institute, chemotherapy scheme and age (above 50 years or younger). The main end‐point was to detect a 5% increase in the 5 year survival (from 80% to 85%) in favor of treatment A. Secondary end‐ points were relapse free survival (RFS), local control, incidence of second primary breast cancer.
Results:
After exclusion of all patients from three sites because of inadequate documentation, a total of 1724 patients (93%) were analyzed (Treatment A 861 and Control 863). At a median follow‐up of 6.5 years, 396 deaths (23%) and 602 RFS events (35%) (relapse and/or death) have been observed.

To assess whether the use of intervention A as an adjunct to colposcopy increases the detection of biopsy confirmed CIN 2, 3 (high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia).
Methods:
This is a multicenter two‐arm randomized trial comparing colposcopy alone with colposcopy plus intervention A. Patients were recruited from 13 colposcopy clinics in a variety of practice settings. 2299 women referred for the evaluation of an abnormal cervical cytology were randomized with stratification by cytology; subsequently 113 women were excluded for a variety of reasons. The main study outcomes were differences in true‐positive rates (CIN 2, 3 and cancer identified) and false‐positive rates between the study arms.
Results:
The true‐positive (TP) rates were 14.4% vs. 11.4% (p=0.035, one‐sided) for the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm compared to colposcopy‐only arm, respectively, in women with either an atypical squamous cell (ASC) or low‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) cytology result. TP rates were similar between the two arms among women referred for the evaluation of HSIL (high‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). The 26.5% gain in true‐positives observed with the use of intervention A and colposcopy among women referred for an ASC or LSIL cytology was achieved with only a fractional increase in number of biopsies obtained per patient (0.30) and a modest increase in false‐positive rate
(4%). In the combined colposcopy and intervention A arm among women with ASC or LSIL, the PPV (positive predictive value) of biopsies indicated by ntervention A was 15.0% and the PPV of biopsies indicated by colposcopy was 15.2%. Joint hypothesis testing indicates that intervention A and colposcopy provides benefit compared to colposcopy alone among women with ASC or LSIL.
Conclusion:
Combining intervention A with colposcopy provides a clinically meaningful increase in the detection of CIN 2, 3 in women referred for the evaluation of mildly abnormal cytology results.",spin,"Imagine doctors are looking for a certain type of abnormal cell in the cervix (the lower part of the uterus).

The study looked at how well the women were doing over time, checking for things like:

* **No cancer coming back:**  The new medicine and the standard medicine were equally good at preventing cancer from coming back overall.
* **No cancer coming back near the original tumor:**  Again, the new and standard medicine were about the same.
* **No cancer spreading to other parts of the body:**  Again, the new and standard medicine were about the same.
* **Overall survival:**  Again, the new and standard medicine were about the same.

However, in women whose cancer had spread to nearby lymph nodes, the new medicine seemed to be slightly better at preventing cancer from coming back near the original tumor.

Overall, the study didn't show a big difference between the new and standard medicine.  But in a specific group of women, the new medicine might be a good option.  Doctors need more research to be sure.

54,17264336,Phase III trial of concurrent or sequential adjuvant chemoradiotherapy after conservative surgery for early-stage breast cancer: final results of the ARCOSEIN trial,J Clin Oncol,"Purpose:
In 1996, we initiated the multicenter phase III randomized trial to compare the effect on disease‐free survival (DFS) of experimental treatment A versus comparator B after breast‐conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer. This report presents the clinical results with a median follow‐up of 60 months.
Patients and methods:
Between February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial (358 randomized to comparator B and 358 to treatment A) and respectively 343 and 352 patients were included in the analysis. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery. The primary endpoint was disease‐free survival (DFS) defined as the time from randomization to the first treatment failure (in the ipsilateral breast, in the axillary/infraclavicular/IMCs, or at a distant site) or death (if no recurrence had been noted).
Results:
There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5‐year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS; 92% in comparator B v 95% in treatment A; P = .76), metastasis‐free survival (87% in comparator B v 84% in treatment A; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in comparator B v 91% in treatment A; P = .76).
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than comparator B after breast‐conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer.",no_spin,"Imagine doctors are testing a new medicine (Treatment A) to see if it helps breast cancer patients.  They compared it to a standard treatment (Comparator B).

The results?  There wasn't a big difference between the new medicine and the standard treatment.  Both groups had similar success rates in all the ways they measured.  So, the new medicine wasn't better than the old one.

Treatment A is effective against HER‐2‐positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy of treatment A in HER‐2‐negative and HER‐2‐uncharacterized MBC.
Patients and methods:
Women with MBC were randomly assigned to first‐line therapy with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks plus treatment A or placebo. A preplanned retrospective evaluation of HER‐2 status was performed using fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP); secondary end points were objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), event‐free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS).
Results:
In the intent‐to‐treat population (n = 579), there were no significant differences in TTP, EFS, or OS between treatment arms, although differences in ORR and CBR were noted. In 86 HER‐2‐positive patients (15%), treatment with paclitaxel‐ treatment A resulted in statistically significant improvements in TTP, EFS, ORR, and CBR compared with paclitaxel‐placebo.

The study found that Treatment A didn't help *everyone* quit smoking any better than the placebo.  However, it *did* help people who were also depressed quit smoking more often.  For those with depression, Treatment A seemed to reduce withdrawal symptoms and improve their quality of life.

The surprising part is that even with Treatment A, people with depression still had a lower rate of quitting than those without depression.  Those without depression quit at about the same rate whether they got Treatment A or just the nicotine patches and counseling.

502 patients were randomly assigned to receive comparator B and 504 to receive combined treatment A. Median follow‐up was 37.2 months (24.8‐52.3). Median overall survival was 18.8 months (17.0‐23.2) for patients receiving comparator B versus 18.6 months (16.5‐20.6) for those receiving treatment A. Overall survival did not differ between the two groups (hazard ratio 1.05 [95% CI 0.90‐1.21], p=0.55; absolute difference 0.3% (‐5.1 to 5.6) at 1 year and 2.7% (‐8.2 to 2.9) at 3 years). Serious adverse events were reported in 113 (23%) patients receiving comparator B and 131 (26%) of those receiving combined treatment A.
Interpretation:
Although treatment A does not improve overall or progression‐free survival compared with comparator B, treatment A might still have a role because it can produce remissions that are of clinically relevant length in some patients. Identification of patients who will benefit from treatment A is crucial.",spin,"Imagine two teams of kids playing a game.

The results showed that the kids on both teams lived about the same amount of time.  The special medicine didn't make a big difference in how long they lived.  The difference was so small, it was like saying one team lived 1 day longer than the other, which is not a big deal.

Some kids on the special medicine team got better for a while, but it didn't change how long they lived overall.  So, the researchers think it might be important to figure out which kids would get the best results from the special medicine.

We aimed to compare overall survival in patients receiving treatment A or comparator B.
Methods:
This was an open‐label randomized trial undertaken in 50 centres across eight countries. 1006 treatment‐naive patients diagnosed with advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma were randomly allocated (1 to 1) by minimization to receive comparator B or treatment A. Treatment was not masked. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Treatment groups were compared with a non‐stratified log‐ rank test. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN XXXX.
Findings:
502 patients were randomly assigned to receive comparator B and 504 to receive combined treatment A. Median follow‐up was 37.2 months (24.8‐52.3).

Constipation, neuropathy, non‐neuropathy neurologic toxicity, and skin reactions were significantly more frequent in the treatment A arm.

Cancer‐related fatigue is a debilitating symptom affecting psychosocial functioning and quality of life in 70% to 100% of cancer patients during and after treatment. The authors examined the effect of 200 mg of treatment A compared to placebo on the severity of cancer‐related fatigue.
Methods:
The authors conducted a multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐ controlled, phase 3, clinical trial to examine the effect of treatment A on patient‐ reported fatigue in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. A sample of 877 cancer patients beginning chemotherapy at 23 geographically separate University of Rochester Cancer Center (URCC) Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) affiliates were assessed for fatigue. Patients who reported fatigue (N = 867) were randomly assigned to receive either treatment A or a placebo. Treatment began on Day 5 of Cycle 2 and ended after Day 7 of Cycle 4.

The median PFS was 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD (n = 65) versus 3.7 months for PLD (n = 60) (hazards ratio, 0.92; P = 0.7243). A preplanned subgroup analysis showed that 75 patients with platinum‐refractory or primary platinum‐resistant OC had a median PFS of 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD versus 2.9 months for PLD (hazards ratio, 0.55; P = 0.0425). Hematologic adverse events were 66% on the treatment A + PLD arm versus 44% on the PLD arm, manageable with dose reductions. Nonhematologic adverse events were similar for both arms. The incidence of palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis was lower on treatment A + PLD (23%, 31%, respectively) versus (39%, 49%, respectively) on PLD.
Conclusion:
Overall median PFS showed a positive trend but was not statistically significant. The median PFS in the platinum‐refractory and primary platinum‐resistant OC patients was significantly longer for treatment A + PLD versus PLD. Treatment A may ameliorate the palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis known to be associated with PLD.

This study looked at how well this new medicine worked when combined with a medicine already used (PLD) compared to just using PLD alone.

They gave one group Treatment A plus PLD, and another group just PLD.  They tracked how long the cancer stayed under control (progression-free survival) and looked for side effects.

The overall results showed that the new combination might be slightly better, but it wasn't a big enough difference to be sure.  However, when they looked at a specific group of people with a more difficult form of the cancer, the new combination was much better at keeping the cancer under control.

The side effects were similar in both groups, but the new combination seemed to cause fewer problems like skin redness and mouth sores.

Overall, the study suggests the new combination might be helpful, especially for a certain group of patients, and worth further study.  But more research is needed to be completely sure.

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment A in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer (OC).
Methods:
Patients with platinum‐refractory or ‐resistant primary or secondary) OC were randomized to receive treatment A and PLD at 50 mg/m2 intravenously or PLD alone at 50 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 every 28 days until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression‐free survival (PFS). Other end points were objective response rate, and safety. The study was originally planned for 244 patients. The trial was temporarily placed on hold after 125 patients were randomized while the results of another trial were being reviewed and the sponsor decided not to resume enrollment. The interim analysis became the final analysis.
Results:
The median PFS was 5.6 months for treatment A + PLD (n = 65) versus 3.7 months for PLD (n = 60) (hazards ratio, 0.92; P = 0.7243). ORR was 12.3% for treatment A + PLD vs. 8.3% for PLD, p=0.5640. Hematologic adverse events were 66% on the treatment A + PLD arm versus 44% on the PLD arm with neutropenia 40.0% vs. 22.8%; thrombopenia 33.8% vs. 7.0%; febrile neutropenia10.8% vs. 3.5%. Nonhematologic adverse events were similar for both arms. The incidence of palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia and stomatitis was lower on treatment A + PLD (23%, 31%, respectively) versus (39%, 49%, respectively) on PLD. The incidence of nausea and fatigue was higher in treatment A + PLD 60.0% vs. 49.1% and 43.1% vs. 36.8%).Thirteen deaths caused by serious adverse event were reported 7 with treatment A + PLD vs. 6 with PLD.

This phase III trial assesses whether treatment A increases the duration of functional independence after surgery or radiosurgery of brain metastases.
Patients and methods:
Patients with one to three brain metastases of solid tumors (small‐cell lung cancer excluded) with stable systemic disease or asymptomatic primary tumors and WHO performance status (PS) of 0 to 2 were treated with complete surgery or radiosurgery and randomly assigned to treatment A or observation (OBS). The primary end point was time to WHO PS deterioration to more than 2.
Results:
Of 359 patients, 199 underwent radiosurgery, and 160 underwent surgery. In the radiosurgery group, 100 patients were allocated to OBS, and 99 were allocated to treatment A. After surgery, 79 patients were allocated to OBS, and 81 were allocated to treatment A. The median time to WHO PS more than 2 was 10.0 months (95% CI, 8.1 to 11.7 months) after OBS and 9.5 months (95% CI, 7.8 to 11.9 months) after treatment A (P = .71). Overall survival was similar in the treatment A and OBS arms (median, 10.9 v 10.7 months, respectively; P = .89). Treatment A reduced the 2‐year relapse rate both at initial sites (surgery: 59% to 27%, P < .001; radiosurgery: 31% to 19%, P = .040) and at new sites (surgery: 42% to 23%, P = .008; radiosurgery: 48% to 33%, P = .023). Salvage therapies were used more frequently after OBS than after treatment A. Intracranial progression caused death in 78 (44%) of 179 patients in the OBS arm and in 50 (28%) of 180 patients in the treatment A arm.
Conclusion:
After radiosurgery or surgery of a limited number of brain metastases, treatment A reduces intracranial relapses and neurologic deaths but fails to improve the duration of functional independence and overall survival.",spin,"This study looked at how well two different treatments for brain tumors helped people stay healthy and independent after surgery or radiation.

They were divided into two groups: one group got a special treatment (Treatment A) and the other group didn't (called ""observation"").  They wanted to see if Treatment A made people stay independent longer.

The study found that Treatment A didn't help people stay independent longer, or live longer overall.  However, Treatment A *did* seem to help reduce the chance of the cancer coming back in the brain (relapses) after surgery or radiation.  It also seemed to reduce the number of deaths from the brain tumors themselves.

So, while Treatment A might help with the cancer coming back, it didn't make a difference in how long people stayed healthy and independent.

We examined the value of treatment A in a phase III trial with strict preoperative staging and surgical resection guidelines.
Patients and methods:
Patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagogastric junction (AEG II and III) were randomly assigned to treatment A followed by surgery or to surgery alone. To detect with 80% power an improvement in median survival from 17 months with surgery alone to 24 months with treatment A, 282 events were required.
Results:
This trial was stopped for poor accrual after 144 patients were randomly assigned (72:72); 52.8% patients had tumors located in the proximal third of the stomach, including AEG type II and III. The International Union against Cancer R0 resection rate was 81.9% after treatment A as compared with 66.7% with surgery alone (P = .036). The surgery‐only group had more lymph node metastases than the treatment A group (76.5% v 61.4%; P = .018).

Conclusion:
This trial showed a significantly increased R0 resection rate but failed to demonstrate a survival benefit. Possible explanations are low statistical power, a high rate of proximal gastric cancer including AEG and/or a better outcome than expected after radical surgery alone due to the high quality of surgery with resections of regional lymph nodes outside the perigastic area (celiac trunc, hepatic ligament, lymph node at a. lienalis; D2).",spin,"Imagine doctors are testing a new medicine (treatment A) for stomach cancer.

Unfortunately, they didn't get enough patients to see a clear difference in how long people lived.  The new medicine *did* help more people have a clean surgery (meaning the cancer was completely removed), but it didn't help them live longer overall.

The study authors think there are a few reasons why the medicine didn't seem to help.  Maybe they didn't have enough people in the study to see a difference, or maybe the surgery alone was already really good, so the medicine didn't add much.

In short, the new medicine didn't prove to be better than surgery alone for helping people live longer, but it did help more people have a clean surgery.

The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of treatment A for sleep in people with cancer who were undergoing cancer treatment. Participants were randomized to receive treatment A or placebo orally 1 hour before bedtime for 8 weeks. The primary end point was area under the curve (AUC) of the overall Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Secondary outcomes included the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), and the Profile of Mood States (POMS).

Patients and methods:
Men with progressive mCRPC despite androgen deprivation were eligible and randomized 1:1. Patients received docetaxel (75 mg/m2 day 1) and prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily every 21 days with either treatment A or placebo twice daily orally on days 1‐3. The primary end point was overall survival (OS).
Results:
Two hundred and twenty‐one patients were randomly assigned. Median OS for treatment A plus docetaxel‐prednisone (ADP) and placebo‐DP was 18.1 versus 17.8 months [hazard ratio (HR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.72‐1.55, P=0.63]. Secondary end points were also not statistically different. Grade 3/4 toxic effects for ADP versus placebo‐DP were cardiac events (5% versus 2%), lymphopenia (23% versus 16%), neutropenia (47% versus 40%), ileus (2% versus 0%) and pulmonary embolism (6% versus 2%). In a subgroup of high‐risk mCRPC (n=34), outcomes appeared to favor ADP (median OS 19 versus 14 months).
Conclusion:
Treatment A was not more effective than placebo in metastatic castration‐ resistant prostate cancer patients.",no_spin,"Imagine a doctor is testing a new medicine (Treatment A) to help people with a bad kind of prostate cancer.  They gave this medicine to some people, and a different medicine to others (a placebo, which is like a sugar pill).  They tracked how long each group lived.

The study found that the people who got Treatment A didn't live any longer than the people who got the placebo.  So, the new medicine didn't seem to help.

The study also looked at side effects.  Some side effects were more common in the group that got Treatment A, like heart problems, low blood cell counts, and some tummy issues.

There was a small group of people in the study who were very sick, and it *looked* like Treatment A might have helped them a little more. But even in that group, the difference wasn't big enough to be sure.

The important thing is that the study didn't show that Treatment A was better than the placebo.  So, we should be careful about thinking it's a good treatment.  Scientists need more studies to be sure.

13,9093724,Doubling epirubicin dose intensity (100 mg/m2 versus 50 mg/m2) in the FEC regimen significantly increases response rates. An international randomised phase III study in metastatic breast cancer. The Epirubicin High Dose (HEPI 010) Study Group,Ann Oncol,"Purpose:
A phase III study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) to evaluate the effect on response rate and survival of a treatment A.
Patients and methods:
Four hundred fifty‐six patients were randomized to receive either treatment A or comparator B in combination with 5‐FU (500 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) i.v., every 21 days for a maximum of six cycles (eight in case of CR).
Results:
Of 456 patients, 390 were evaluable for efficacy. Objective response (CR + PR) was seen in 57% (treatment A) vs. 41% (comparator B) of the evaluable patients (P = 0.003). The CR rate was higher in the treatment A arm (12% vs. 7%, P = 0.07). Treatment A produced significantly higher response rates in patients with visceral localization (50% vs. 34%, P = 0.011) and in patients with more than two metastatic organ sites (64% vs. 37%, P = 0.001). Median time to progression (7.6 vs. 7 months) and overall survival (18 months vs. 17 months) were similar. Myelosuppression was the principal toxic effect, with grade IV neutropenia observed in 57% of the patients treated with treatment A vs. 9% of those on comparator B. Grade IV infection or febrile neutropenia were observed in 8% (treatment A) vs. 0.4% (comparator B), but the incidence of septic death was the same in the two arms (two patients each). Cardiac toxicity was similar in the two treatment groups, with 5% vs. 3% of the patients taken off study due to cardiac events, primarily due to a decline in LVEF. Only three patients (two in treatment A) experienced congestive heart failure.
Conclusion:
This trial shows that treatment A can be administered for repeated cycles without bone marrow support with increased, though acceptable, toxicity and with a significant increase of antitumor effect (especially in visceral and/or high‐burden disease), but no increased survival.",spin,"Imagine doctors are testing a new medicine (Treatment A) to help people with a bad kind of cancer called metastatic breast cancer.  They compared it to a standard treatment (Comparator B).

They gave the medicine to some people and the standard treatment to others, all while also giving them other medicines (5-FU and cyclophosphamide).  They watched how well the medicine worked and how long the people lived.

The new medicine seemed to work better in some ways.  More people who got the new medicine had their cancer shrink (57% vs. 41%).  It worked especially well for people whose cancer had spread to their organs inside the body or to many different parts of their body.  But, the new medicine made some people get sick, like having very low blood counts (myelosuppression).  The new medicine caused more serious side effects like this in more people than the standard treatment.  The new medicine didn't help people live longer overall.

So, the new medicine might be better at shrinking the cancer, especially in certain situations, but it also has more side effects and doesn't make people live longer.
