As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
From v4.47 onwards, when a model cache is to be returned, `generate` will return a `Cache` instance instead by default (as opposed to the legacy tuple of tuples format). If you want to keep returning the legacy format, please set `return_legacy_cache=True`.

Running evaluation on the dataset:   0%|          | 0/60 [00:00<?, ?it/s]The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input because pad token is same as eos token. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
From v4.47 onwards, when a model cache is to be returned, `generate` will return a `Cache` instance instead by default (as opposed to the legacy tuple of tuples format). If you want to keep returning the legacy format, please set `return_legacy_cache=True`.

Running evaluation on the dataset:   0%|          | 0/60 [00:00<?, ?it/s]The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input because pad token is same as eos token. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
From v4.47 onwards, when a model cache is to be returned, `generate` will return a `Cache` instance instead by default (as opposed to the legacy tuple of tuples format). If you want to keep returning the legacy format, please set `return_legacy_cache=True`.
